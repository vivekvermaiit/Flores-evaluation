"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de tɛ jate ladilikan ɲuman ye walasa ka akɔridiyɔn fɔ?","The passage advises against using too much force when playing the accordion and emphasizes using finesse and speed.  Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: Walasa ka mankan layɛlɛ, i bɛ butɔnw digu ni fanga min ye, dɔ fara o kan** - ""To create sound variations, increase the amount of force with which you press the buttons."" This directly contradicts the passage's advice against excessive force.

*   **B: Lamagali nafatanw dɔgɔya kosɛbɛ walasa i ka mɛn ka sɔrɔ i ma sɛgɛn** - ""Minimize unnecessary movements to delay fatigue."" This aligns with the idea of conserving energy and avoiding strain.

*   **C: I hakili to a la ka fɔlikanw digi ka i bolo to lafiya kɔnɔ** - ""Remember to press the buttons and keep your hand relaxed."" This promotes a relaxed and efficient playing style, fitting the passage's sentiment.

*   **D: Dɔ fara i ka nɛgɛniw digi cogo teliya kan walasa ka farankan mankan sɔrɔ** - ""Increase the speed at which you press the buttons to get a varied sound."" This supports the passage's point about using speed and finesse.

Therefore, **A** is the only option that offers bad advice according to the passage.

**Final Answer: A**"
"N'i bɛ ka akɔridiyɔn fɔ, ninnu jumɛn de b’i dɛmɛ ka dɔfara mankan kan?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: Digili dɔgɔman**.

The text explicitly states that to achieve a more melodious sound on the accordion, you should press the keys with *less* force and speed (""i bɛ nɛgɛniw digi ni fanga ni teliya dɔɔnin ye"").  ""Digili dɔgɔman"" translates to ""less pressing"" or ""less digging.""

Munna jabarani jaw kunw tigɛlendo?,"The prompt is in two different languages. The first part is in Kikuyu, discussing the problem of overscan when converting film to DVD. The second part is in Bambara, asking ""What is a digital image?"".

Here's a breakdown and translation:

*   **Kikuyu part:** This explains that TVs often crop the edges of the picture (overscan) to ensure the image fills the screen. When converting film to DVD, this can mean some parts of the original image are lost, especially elements near the edges.

*   **Bambara part:** The question is *Munna jabarani jaw kunw tigɛlendo?* which translates to ""What is a digital image?""
    *   A: Ka dugumasɛbɛnniw yamaruya - ""Collection of documents""
    *   B: Walasa ja ka ekaran bɛɛ lafa - ""A picture made up of all kinds of colors""
    *   C: Ka yɛlɛmali nɔgɔmanw yɛlɛmali yamaruya fɔrima wɛrɛw la - ""A simple image transformed from other old images""
    *   D: Ka dugumasɛbɛnni tigɛ ka surunya dugumana na kosɛbɛ - ""A digital image is a representation of data stored and processed in a binary format.""

**The correct answer is D.** It best describes a digital image in a technical manner.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mɔgɔ bɛ se ka nin degun jumɛn kelen de sɔrɔ n'a bɛ ka filimu dɔ yɛlɛma ka ta DVD fɔrima la?","The correct answer is **B: Dugumasɛbɛnniw fan dɔ tigɛ (A portion of the image is cut off)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage in Swahili explains that overscan on TVs cuts off the edges of the image. When you convert a film to DVD, this overscan means that some of the original film's content might be lost because it's outside the visible area on many TVs.
*   The correct translation to bambara will reflect this concept.
*   Option B translates to ""A portion of the image is cut off"", which accurately describes the effect of overscan.
*   Options A and C are contradictory
*   Option D is not relevant to the explanation of the effect of overscan."
Bretaɲi kɛlɛbolo dɔ tun bɛ min?,"The answer is **C: Bordentown**.

The text states that Cadwalder's forces will be sent to Bordentown to prevent the French from crossing. This makes Bordentown a British-held territory.
"
Jɔn de tigɛnɔ yera tigɛra sɛbɛni kan?,"The correct answer is **A: John Dunlap**.

The text states that John Dunlap was a ""gafedilanyɔrɔ"" (printer) who made copies of the document. While others were involved in reading or receiving it, he was the one who printed it.
"
"Nin yɔrɔ kofɔtɔ ninnu na, Dunlap broadside dɔ sera laban jumɛn na?","Based on the provided text, the Dunlap broadside reached London last among the options listed.

The text mentions the following dates for the Dunlap broadside reaching these locations:
*   New York (to George Washington): July 6
*   Independence Hall (read by John Dixon): July 8
*   London: October 10

Therefore, the correct answer is C: London."
Kolonɛli Stark ka kɛlɛkulu tun bɛ min?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **A: Kɔkɔdugu yanfan dan na, ka bɛn sinsan ma**.

The text states: ""Stark ka mɔgɔw jɔra dakɔrɔra gɛrɛfɛ kɔkɔdugu yanfan dan na faganmarakɛlaw ka jɔyɔrɔla...u ye sinsan bɔɲan jɔna nin kabkuru kɔgɔ surumaniye kɔkɔ yanfan dan fɔ ji dagolola jida fitini sanfɛ.""
"
"K'a kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Stark ka mɔgɔw y'u ka sinsan bonya tuma jumɛn?","The correct answer is **B: Kɛlɛkɛdenw tɛmɛnenw kɔ gulonni berew la (Kɛlɛkɛdenw tɛmɛnenw kɔ gulonni berew la)**.

The passage states that Stark ordered his men not to fire until the enemy was within 100 feet and ""nin u yɛrɛw ka kɛlɛkɛdenw tɛmɛna la (until their own troops had passed)"". This implies they were to hold their fire until after their own troops were in position or had moved past a certain point, effectively giving the enemy the time to move. While not exact of course to ""gulonni berew la"", this is the best option from the given choices.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de tun ye Sini nin juguya waati ba ye?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: Masamara Sabaw waati**.

The passage explicitly states: ""O waatiw la lakodɔnniba tun ye **MasamaraSaba ka waati** ye min ye san 60 kɛ Han ni Jin Fangabolo ni ɲɔgɔn cɛ."" And it continues to say that ""MasamaraSabaw kɛra jolibonbawaatiw ye Sini lawalema tariku la..."" (The Three Kingdoms era was a time of great bloodshed in Chinese history).
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de ye tiɲɛ ye dugumɛnɛ kulu don tɔ sigiyɔrɔfalen la?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**C: U bɛ ɲaga da min bɛ falen tile 17 kɔfɛ**

This aligns with the last sentence of the passage: ""Nin yɔrɔfalen falen girin girinw walima tamaw be tile tani 17 de kɛ"" which translates to ""These migrations or travels last 17 days."" Thus, they migrate to a place they will change every 17 days.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U bɛ don ɲagala sufɛ** The passage mentions that the kulu be tama sufɛ (the group travels at night) but doesn't state that they arrive at the location at night.
*   **B: U ka dumuni maralenw dɔgɔyara** While the passage says ""kulu be sigiyɔrɔfalen falen baaraw daminɛ nin dumuni minunw beyi dɔgɔyala"" (the group begins migration when food supplies are low), it does not state their food is stored at the location.
*   **D: U bɛ tama tilefɛ** The passage doesn't mention any specific direction like ""tilefɛ"" (east)."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kumasen jumɛn de bɛ dugumɛnɛkulu ka ɲagada delinakow ye sigiyɔrɔfalen waati la?","The correct answer is **B: U bɛ tama tile 17 ka sɔrɔ u m'a don ɲaga la.**

Here's why:

* The passage states ""Nin yɔrɔfalen falen girin girinw walima tamaw be tile tani 17 de kɛ,"" which means ""These little shifts or walks take 17 days."" Therefore, the ant colony is walking for 17 days before they can even start constructing new nests.
"
Fɔta jumɛn de bɛ taa fɛ hali ni kɛnɛma taamasiɲɛw bɛ yen?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Waatidɔw la yɛlɛmaliw**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly mentions ""Waatidɔw la yɛlɛmali, minunw tɛ jaabi dɔrɔn ye kɛrɛmara siɲi ye, sɛbɛna balofɛnw camaw kan, bakiteriw, sanpiɲɔn, jiriw ani bangaw b'ula"". This translates to ""Time-related changes, which are not just a simple response to external stimuli, are observed in many living things, including bacteria, mushrooms, trees, and animals.""

The other options are related to the text, but are not the direct answer to the question ""Which of the following persists even without external signals?"". While internal adaptations and regulated body temperatures are mentioned, the prompt is specifically targeting changes that continue even without external signals, which aligns with the description of ""Waatidɔw la yɛlɛmaliw"" (time-related changes or circadian rhythms)."
Kumaden jumɛn de bɛ mɔgɔw ɲɛfɔ minnu kɛcoko n’u yɛrɛ jogo tɛ kelen ye?,"The correct answer is **D: Suguya caman**.

Here's why:

* **The Passage (P) explains:** It states that different things (fɛnw) that show many variations of a specific characteristic (cogoya kɛrɛnkɛrɛni ye) are called ""farikolo camaw"" which roughly translates to ""many types"" or ""multiple varieties"".

* **The Question (Q) asks:** Which term refers to people whose behavior and personality are not the same?  This implies a *variety* or *multiplicity* of traits.

Therefore, ""Suguya caman"" (many types/varieties) is the most fitting answer.
"
Ninnu cɛla jumɛn kelen de ye danɲɛ ye min bɛ nimafɛw minnu bɛ sinsin yɔrɔ kɛrɛnkɛrɛnna ?,"The correct answer is **A: Suguya kelen**.

Here's why:

*   The text defines ""farikolo kelenw"" (singular organisms) as belonging to the same species. The word for species is ""suguya"" in Bambara.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Popilasiyɔn (Population):** A population is a group of individuals of the *same species* living in a particular area. While the passage mentions population, the question asks for the single word that identifies organisms that belong to same thing.

*   **C: Fɛ suguyaw**

*   **D: Suguya caman (Many species):** This refers to a group of different species, not a single one."
Ninnu jumɛn de tɛ se ka kɛ kunkokanu yɔrɔlajɛli misaliya baara ye?,"The passage describes activities within ecotourism that focus on observing and learning about the natural environment, especially forests and their inhabitants. Let's break down why each option is or is not an example:

*   **A: Jibɔyɔrɔ sennataama** - While this COULD be related to ecotourism if the hiking specifically focuses on observing and appreciating nature responsibly, it is not explicitly mentioned or implied as a common practice in the provided text.

*   **B: Kunkokɔnɔ falenfɛnw fototali** - This aligns directly with the description of ecotourism activities, particularly ""fotota"" and the example of photographing orangutans.

*   **C: Mize Siyansi lajɛli** - This aligns with the description of ecotourism activities because a ""kunaforiniw kalani yɔrɔ ani jiri kɛcogoyala"".

*   **D: Panni jɛgɛmɔli** - While fishing can be a part of tourism, the given definition emphasizes observation and study. Fishing is more about extraction and resource use, not observation.

Therefore, based on the definition given, the best answer is **A: Jibɔyɔrɔ sennataama** because it is the least connected to the stated activities of ecotourism and more connected to general tourist activities."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, tiransipɔri fɛrɛɛ sigile bɛ jumɛn kelen de ka?","The correct answer is **B: Tɔgɔla mɔbiliw**

The passage states: ""...tiransipɔri fɛrɛɛw la min sirileno no yɛrɛtɔgɔla mɔbiliw kan."" This directly translates to ""transportation systems that rely on self-driving cars"". Therefore, tɔgɔla mɔbiliw (self-driving cars) is the place where the transportation systems are based, according to the passage.
"
Paritikili minnu bɛ ka kɔnɔna munumunu kuran sugu jumɛn b’olu?,"Based on the text:

*   Protons have positive charge.
*   Neutrons have no charge.

The question asks about the particles inside the nucleus. The passage states, ""The nucleus is composed of two particles: neutrons and protons."" Since protons have positive charge, the answer is:

**A: Kuran ɲuman** (Positive charge)
"
Kɔnɔna dilannen do ni paritikili jumɛnw ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Neturɔnw ani purotɔnw**.

The passage states: ""Kɔnɔna dilan ne dɔn ni paritiki fila ye: neturɔn ani purotɔn."" which translates to ""The nucleus is composed of two particles: neutrons and protons.""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jumɛn kelen de ye misali ye min ka dɔgɔ binari jateden duuru la?","Based on the passage, binary numbers are composed of only 0s and 1s. A binary number of ""duuru"" (five) digits will therefore have five positions that can be filled with either a 0 or a 1. The question asks for a binary number *smaller* than a five-digit binary number. While the passage doesn't precisely define how to compare binary numbers, it follows similar logic to decimal (base-10) numbers - generally, fewer digits indicates a smaller number.

Now, let's look at the options:

*   **A: 1010** - This is a four-digit binary number, so it's a possibility.
*   **B: 12001** - This contains the digit 2, making it *not* a binary number. We can eliminate it.
*   **C: 10010** - This is a five-digit binary number, so it is not *smaller than* a five-digit binary number
*   **D: 110101** - This is a six-digit binary number, so it is not *smaller than* a five-digit binary number

Thus, the correct answer is **A: 1010** because it's the only *binary* number with fewer than five digits, and therefore smaller than a five-digit binary number.
"
Fila fila jatedenw bɛ se ka wele cogo wɛrɛ la di?,"The correct answer is **A: Bits**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...nin jateden be jateminɛ inafɔ fila fila jateden - walima bits..."" which means ""these numbers are calculated as binary digits - or bits...""
"
Ninnu jumɛn kelen de ma kofɔ tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ inafɔ kalanden ka bulɔguli nafa fɔlɔ?,"Let's analyze the passage and the answer options:

*   **P Passage Summary:** The passage discusses the benefits of blogging for students, focusing on:
    *   Developing writing skills and critical thinking.
    *   Engaging students in collaborative learning.
    *   Encouraging reflection and analysis.
    *   Providing a platform for students to express themselves and engage with others' ideas.

Now let's look at the options:

*   **A: Kan sariyaw ani sɛbɛncogo cɛɲi taɲɛ (Mastering language conventions and good writing style)** While blogging helps students improve writing, the passage emphasizes more on the overall benefits rather than only this aspect.

*   **B: Kalanden ɲɔgɔnw ka kiritikeli dɔgɔyali (Reducing student criticism of each other)** The passage mentions that students become critical thinkers, not that they reduce criticism. It doesn't focus on decreasing criticism between students but on developing critical thinking skills in general.

*   **C: Lafaamuyali jɛnsɛlen kɛrɛfɛ mɔgɔw la (Expanding understanding beyond individuals)** This is essentially what the passage describes. Blogging opens up the learning experience for students beyond traditional classroom settings. It promotes sharing ideas, learning from others, and engaging with a wider audience.

*   **D: Nege layɛlɛlen kalan nɔfɔ tugu la (Pursuing a desire to follow learning effects)**  While the passage suggests blogging increases student motivation, this option isn't directly and centrally emphasized as a *primary* benefit.

**Therefore, the best answer is C.** The passage explicitly states that blog work helps students ""expand their knowledge in the world around them"" and allows them to express themselves to others, which aligns with expanding understanding beyond individuals."
Ninnu fɛnw kelen jumɛn de ko fɔra bulɔguli la inafɔ dusudonbaga kalanden ka sɛbɛnli taɲɛlila?,"Based on the passage, the most accurate answer is **A: Nin fɛnw jaabili ye ɛntɛrɛnɛti jaabili ye ɛntɛrinɛti kumacaman**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Bulɔgu itilize ɲuman """"be seka fagan di kalandenw ma ka kɛ mirilili ani sɛgɛsɛgɛli kɛlaw ye; **Nin ɛntɛrɛnɛti fɛnw jaabili ye**, kalandenw be sek'u jɔyɔrɔw ɲɛfɔ mɔgɔ wɛrɛw ka sɛbɛni siratigɛla, ani be sek'u yɛrɛ hakilinaw fɔ kunbalan kɛrɛnkɛrɛnlen dɔ kuna."" This directly links blogging to internet resources and feedback.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Ka kiritikeli balili negeminɛ** (Critical thinking impediment): The passage suggests blogs *encourage* critical thinking.
*   **C: Ka bulɔgu kalanbaaw sakona ko to senna** (Making blog reading courses more difficult): The passage does not specify how or why blog use could affect blog reading comprehension in classes.
*   **D: Baarakɛɲɔgɔnya mago** (Collaboration need): While collaboration is mentioned, the most direct point related to the advantage of blogging and developing/influencing writing skills is the point about internet feedback."
Ninnu kelen jumɛn de nafa tɛ kalandenw ka kuma fɔnfɔni ye ɲɔgɔnkɔ? ,"The correct answer is **C: Baarakɛwaati minnu bɛ ka falen (Work hours that are changing)**.

Here's why:

* **P states that flexible scheduling is one way to improve the learning experience**, as it implies the students have more flexibility to learn when they want. 
* **Internet access** benefits students by providing 24/7 access to learning materials. 
* **Direct access to instructors** allows students to get answers to questions quickly.
* **Control over their own learning** empowers students and allows them to tailor the experience to their needs.

Flexible work hours (i.e., working at any time) do not take away from the ability to be able to use the internet to learn, direct access to instructors at any time, and the ability to control one's learning process. 
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu fɛnw kelen jumɛn kuma fɔnfɔni ye ɲɔgɔnkɔ tɛ se ka yɛlɛma kalandenw ye?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Kalan kɛ minɛ**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Kalan kɛli bɛrɛla (Learning independently):** The passage states that blended learning allows students to work more independently.
*   **B: Baarakɛwaatiw (Working hours):** The passage specifically mentions that blended learning is a way to change work schedules.
*   **D: Ɛntɛrɛnɛti itilizeli (Internet usage):** The passage highlights the use of the internet and the World Wide Web to provide students with access to information at all times.

The passage does not say that blended learning directly changes the **kalan kɛ minɛ (learning location)** of the students.
"
Mun de ma kofɔ ni tɛmɛsira in na inafɔ fɛn min mɔgɔ bi se ka fara mejewali faamasow kan?,"The prompt asks about the purpose and construction of ancient royal castles, focusing on the feelings and imagery they evoke. We need to find an answer choice that relates to the construction or use of a castle.

*   **A: Sato kaso digɛn kɔnɔ (Inside a prison wall)** - This relates to imprisonment, which could be part of a castle's function, but doesn't address the overall construction or main purpose.

*   **B: So kɛlɛ kɛlaw (Horse warriors)** - While horses and warriors are associated with castles, this doesn't directly address the castle itself.

*   **C: Sotigideya (Leadership)** - Leadership is related to royalty who might live in a castle, but not the castle's building or purpose.

*   **D: Fama sotigikɛlɛdenw (Royal Cavalry)** - Again, this mentions soldiers associated with the ruler of the castle, but does not talk about its construction.

While none are a *perfect* match, **A: Sato kaso digɛn kɔnɔ (Inside a prison wall)** is the closest.  Castles often had dungeons or served as places of confinement. The prompt mentions ""marima ma kũiga ohũo"" (the smell of fear coming from the prisoner's pit), which relates directly to a prison area inside the castle.

Therefore, the best answer is **A**.
"
Ninnu kelen jumɛn de ma kofɔ ni tɛmɛsira in na inafɔ kasa walima mankan min tun bi ka fɛrɛ ye faamaso tiɲɛniw na?,"Based on the passage provided, the answer is most likely **A: Kɛlɛw (Kɛlɛ)**.

The passage focuses on war, knights, the sounds of horses, and the smell of fear from dungeons. This points to the main purpose of castles being related to warfare.
"
Ninnu kelen jumɛn de bi faamaso Kirby Muxloe cogoya jaati ɲɛfɔ ka?,"The best answer is **D: A tun jɔla walasa ka mɛn kosɔbɛ ani ka kɛlɛ gɛlɛw kunbɛn.**

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that at the time of its construction (1480s), there was ""kayira tun bɛ jamana fanbɛ la ani lakana tun bɛ ɲini fo ni coolokuluni dɔw tun nana binkani na."" This translates to political unrest and a need for protection. Therefore, the castle was built to be strong and withstand attacks.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Faamaso tata kogow tun laɲininen do Lord Hastings fɛ** - While Lord Hastings did start the construction, the passage does not state if he personally designed the ditches and fortifications.

*   **B: A tun mako bɛ kogopɛnpɛrɛnlen fitini na ka sabu kɛ jamana ka bɛn ye jɔli waati la** - The passage does not suggest the fortifications were made smaller to ensure political stability. It says the fortifications were needed because of political instability.

*   **C: Faamaso jɔli tun ta damana ko ye o waati** - While building a castle could be seen as a project, the passage doesn't focus on it being ""ta damana ko ye"" (a grand project). It focuses on the *reason* for building it, which was protection."
Ninnu so jɔli nafaw kelen jumɛn de tun bi se ka jate a damana ko Faamaso Kirby Muxloe la waati kofɔlen na ni tɛmɛsira in na?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Subasema jɔlendo ka min mɛn ka kɛlɛ kunbɛn**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that in the 1480s, there was ""kayira tun bɛ jamana fanbɛ la ani lakana tun bɛ ɲini fo ni coolokuluni dɔw tun nana binkani na"". This translates to a context where instability and the need for defense were present. Therefore, fortifications were a high priority in construction.
*   The passage does mention ""kogopɛnpɛrɛnlenw"" (innovations). Although these existed, the instability context suggests defensive features, i.e., fortification, were the important values in construction.

The other options are less directly supported by the text:

*   A: Finɛtiribaw (Large windows) - There is no mention of the importance of windows.
*   C: Tatakogo jɔli ka dɔgɔ ka tɛmɛn faamaso ka (Building towers smaller than the kingdom's) - No mention of this in the passage.
*   D: Kogopɛnpɛrɛnlenw (Innovations) - While innovations existed, the passage places a greater emphasis on the need for protection, making fortifications a more pressing priority."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de bɛ nafa ba se bolikɛla ma min bɛ k’a labɛn waati nata kama?","The correct answer is **D: Farikoloɲɛnajɛyɔrɔ itilizeli ye ka sanfɛ farikolo fanw bɔɲɔnalibaaraw kɛ** (Using exercise to strengthen the upper body).

Here's why:

* The passage specifically mentions that running in cold weather is stressful on the upper body ( ""nin sanfɛ farikolo fanw bɔɲɔnalibaaraw tuguli y'ala"").
*  Strengthening those upper body muscles will therefore help the runner in future races, especially those in cold weather.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Ka jamana cɛci bolikɛ tilema waatila** (Running across the country in hot weather): The passage mentions cold weather challenges, not hot.
*   **B: Ka sinsin teliya matarafali kan degeli waatila** (Focusing on improving speed during training): While speed is important, the passage focuses on the negative impact of cold weather and the need to prepare the body for it.
*   **C: Ka sanga saba bugɔ** (Hitting the ball three times): This seems unrelated to the context of running.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de nafa ka bon kilimɛtiri tilancɛ boliba kosɛbɛ?","Based on the passage P, the most valuable thing for running a half marathon is:

**D: Ka teliya matarafa ni jija ye (To balance speed with endurance)**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions that speed is reduced in the half marathon, and effort is focused on endurance (""teliya be dɔgɔyala baakɛ ani jijali kɛra jagoya ye"").
*   It also mentions the importance of consistent pace throughout the race (""jija kan ka matarafa kunbalan bɛɛ kɔnɔ"").

The other options are less relevant or directly contradicted by the passage:

*   A: While the passage mentions running in cold weather, it doesn't suggest it's the *most* valuable aspect of a half marathon.
*   B: The passage prioritizes endurance over speed.
*   C: The passage doesn't emphasize a specific time goal like under two hours. It's about consistent effort and pacing."
"Farikoloɲɛnɛjɛra dɔ fɛ, fɔta jumɛn de tɛ se ka sɔrɔ dumuniɲumannafama waleyaw dɔrɔn fɛ?","Based on the provided text:

*   **P states:** ""dumuniɲumannafama yɛrɛ yɛrɛ waleyaw dɔrɔn tɛ seka sanfɛla farikolo se d'ima, nka u be seka farikoloɲɛnɛjɛlaw denmisɛniw ka kɛnɛya yɛlɛma cogoyabala."" This translates to: ""Nutritious eating alone cannot increase the superior physical strength, but it can change the health of the athlete's children.""
*   **P also states:** ""Farikolo kɛnɛya barika dakɛɲɛnali marali, jimi waleyaw ɲuma barali ani dafana fɛnw cogoya cama famuya be seka farikoloɲɛnɛjɛra dɛmɛ ka ka dɔfara a farikolo se kan ani ka ka farikoloɲɛnɛjɛ damu bɔnɲa."" This translates to: ""Maintaining good physical health, improving mental activities, and understanding the many forms of complete things can help the athlete to increase their physical strength and reduce injury.""

**Q asks:** ""For an athlete, which of the following cannot be obtained from nutritious eating alone?""

Based on the text, nutritious eating *alone* cannot increase superior physical strength.

Therefore, the answer is:

**C: Sanfɛla farikolo se** (Superior physical strength)"
"Ka da nin tɛmɛsira in ka, fɔta jumɛn ma poropoze i n’a fɔ sira dɔ min b’a to farikoloɲɛnɛjɛla denmisɛniw walasa k’u farikoloɲɛnɛjɛ damu bɔnɲa sɔrɔ?","Based on the provided text, the best answer is **C: Jimi waleyaw ɲuman**.

Here's why:

*   The passage directly states: ""...jimi waleyaw ɲuma barali ani dafana fɛnw cogoya cama famuya be seka farikoloɲɛnɛjɛra dɛmɛ ka ka dɔfara a farikolo se kan ani ka ka farikoloɲɛnɛjɛ damu bɔnɲa.""
    *   (Translation: ""Improved sleep habits and a good understanding of the various aspects of adequate nutrition can help the adolescent to increase their body strength and minimize the risk of physical health issues."")

The other options, while potentially beneficial for overall health, are not as directly linked to the *specific goal* of helping adolescents minimize the risks for their physical health within the passage."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Muna yɔrɔ camancɛ bolila bɛ se ka fɛnw san minnu da ka gɛlɛn?","The correct answer is **C: A bɛ na nafa ba se u ka farikolo se ma** (It will greatly benefit their health).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that while many dietary supplements are convenient, a lack of understanding leads to people seeking things they don't fully understand.
*   It also mentions that things can be bought that are unnecessary and that many won't benefit their health or will even have a negative effect.
*   This implies that some supplements *can* be beneficial to health when chosen and understood properly.

Therefore, ""A bɛ na nafa ba se u ka farikolo se ma"" aligns best with the information provided."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, yɔrɔ camancɛ bolili be mun de laɲini?","The correct answer is **B: Farikoloɲɛnajɛ dɔnniya banbannen (Enhanced body knowledge)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yɔrɔ camancɛ bolili ye cogola farikoloɲɛnɛjɛ nɔgɔmani ye"" which translates to ""Dietary supplements are intended to facilitate body knowledge."" Therefore, the goal of dietary supplements is to enhance body knowledge.
"
Jɔn ye nikilerɛri makan bɔlen kodɔn? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch ni Purcell**.

The passage states: ""MRI sinsinleno piziki fenomɛni kan min be wele nikilerɛri makan bɔlen ye (NMR), min kodɔn na san ba 1930 kɔnɔ Felix Bloch fɛ (be baara kɛ Stanford Sanfɛkalansola) ani Edward Purcell (Kabɔ Harvard Sanfɛkalansola).""
"
San jumɛn tigiya sɛbɛn dira dɔgɔtɔrɔ nikilerɛri makan bɔlen tɔgɔla? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The passage states: ""San naani kɔfɛ tiyiga sɛbɛn dɔ dir'ama min kun diɲɛ tigiya sɛbɛn fɔlɔ dilile ye MRI domɛni kɔnɔ."" This means ""Four years later, a patent was filed which led to the first global patent in the MRI domain."" It also says that Raymond Damadian understood MRI was a useful medical tool ""San ba 1970 kɔnɔn"" (""In 1970""). Four years after 1970 is 1974.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, adamadenw kan ka faamuyaliba sɔrɔ mun de kan walasa ka tɔw ka ko dogonin dɔw ɲɛnabɔ?","The passage emphasizes understanding others' **kaniya** (beliefs/convictions) to uncover hidden aspects of human behavior.

Therefore, the best answer is **C: Danaya** (which translates to belief/faith/conviction, closely related to ""kaniya"").
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ŋaniya famuyali bɛ adamaden dɛmɛ ka mun kɛ?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Ka danabaliya bɔ adamaden ka dogoninw dɔw kofɛ**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that understanding the intentions of others is very important.
*   It also says that this understanding ""b'a t'anw be adamaden ko dogoninw dɔw ɲɛnɛbɔ,"" which translates to ""helps us shed light on some human mysteries/hidden things.""

Option A best captures the meaning of ""shedding light on human mysteries"" as removing doubt or obscurity, which is similar to removing ""danabaliya"" (doubt/mystery).

Here's why the other options are not the best fit:

*   B: While understanding intentions can *inform* negotiations, it's not the *primary* benefit emphasized in the passage.
*   C: The passage does not mention avoiding judgement. Instead, it discusses how you will judge differently.
*   D: While intention understanding is related to understanding how someone thinks, the passage highlights that it is mostly about the person's intention, not understanding everything that goes on in their head."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn ye AI ka kuntilenna jɔnjɔn ye?","The correct answer is **D: Baara otomatizeli**.

The passage states: ""ɲɛɲili Al kɔnɔ b'a ɲinin ka baaraw otomatize nin mansiniw ye min be tabolo keguma ɲinin"" which translates to ""The goal in AI is to automate tasks with machines that perform table calculations"". This directly supports option D as the main objective.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de jɛlen do ni AI waati dɔw?","The correct answer is **B: Bilalisenkan ani pilanifikasiyɔni** and **D: Tigɛla sɛbɛni dɔnli**.

The passage explicitly mentions ""bilalisenkan ani pilanifikasiyɔni"" and ""tigɛla sɛbɛni dɔnli"" as examples of AI applications. Option A (Kiliyanw dɛmɛni) is implied, but not directly stated as an AI application. Option C (Nzirin filimuw) is just mentioned in the first sentence, but is not related to AI.

Therefore, the best answer is **B and D**.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, fɔta jumɛn de ye mɔgɔ ka fanga ye mɔgɔ min bɛ miiricogokɛ min bɛ ɲɔgɔn sɔrɔ?","Based on the English translation of the prompt and the question, here's the analysis:

*   **The Prompt (P):** Describes a type of thinking that's focused on problem-solving, bringing together different ideas to find a solution. It values speed, intelligence, accuracy, truth, considering all options, and gathering information.  Crucially, it emphasizes finding **a single solution**, even if it's a good or bad one. This thinking is linked to science and logical systems, helping people remember procedures, find solutions, and work scientifically.

*   **The Question (Q):**  Asks which of the options represents the power of someone who has a convergent thinking style (i.e., the type of thinking described in the prompt).

Now let's translate the options:

*   **A: Ka yirali kɛ jaabi ɲuman cama na kungo kelen na (To show examples of many good answers to one question)** - This suggests *divergent* thinking, generating multiple possibilities.
*   **B: Ka fɛɛrɛ kuraw labaara kungo dɔ la (To develop many different methods for one problem)** - This also indicates *divergent* thinking.
*   **C: K’u ka tan ta ka kungo ɲɛnabɔ (To focus their energy to solve a problem)** - This aligns with *convergent* thinking, focusing effort on *one* specific solution.
*   **D: Ka cogoyaw durusi (To expand ideas)** - This also points toward *divergent* thinking.

Therefore, **C is the best answer.** It represents the focus and energy directed towards finding one solution to the problem, which is convergent thinking."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛŋ de tɛ jate inafɔ sinsinyɔrɔ mɔgɔw ka hakilina la minnu miiricogokɛ bɛ ɲɔgɔn sɔrɔ?","Based on the provided text (P), the most important aspect of this type of thinking is:  ""Gũkorago na kĩhonia kĩmwe"" which translates to ""To have one solution"".

Therefore, the closest answer in the Malinke options is:

**A: K’a famu ko jaabi ɲuman kelen dɔrɔn de bɛ yen** which translates to ""To understand that there is only one good answer"".

So the answer is **A**.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de tɛ jate inafɔ farikolo tabolo fitini?","The passage discusses ""farikolo tabolo finitiw"" which are described as subtle body movements happening in milliseconds, like facial expressions. It also mentions people with language comprehension difficulties being able to analyze these subtleties, and even dogs exhibiting similar abilities in understanding human behavior.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Ka yɔrɔwɛrɛ lajɛ n’i bɛ kumana (Looking elsewhere while speaking):** This can be a subtle signal, perhaps indicating discomfort, deception, or lack of interest. It could be considered a ""farikolo tabolo finiti"".
*   **B: K’i ɲɛ sisi (Blinking):** This is a very quick, small facial movement, fitting the description of ""farikolo tabolo finitiw"".
*   **C: K‘i ɲɛ kɔmi teliyala (Twitching your eye quickly):** Eye twitching is again a small and very short facial movement. Likely a ""farikolo tabolo finiti"".
*   **D: Ka bolonkɔni kumaba lawuli (Moving your arm to speak):** This is a much larger, more deliberate movement than the subtle twitches and expressions described in the passage. While gesture, it's less about unconscious fine-tuned motor movements.

Therefore, **D: Ka bolonkɔni kumaba lawuli** is the option that is LEAST likely to be considered a ""farikolo tabolo fitini"" as described in the passage.

**Final Answer: D**"
Ninnu kumasen jumɛn de tɛ tiɲɛ ye farikolo tabolo finiti ɲɛfɔli kan?,"Based on the passage, here's the analysis of each option:

*   **A: Widewo dilan y'an sama ka taa ɲɛtaa nafamanbaw ma:** This statement is **TRUE**. The passage explicitly states that video analysis has helped make significant advancements in understanding subtle physical cues.

*   **B: ɲɛfɔli cogo ɲuman bɛ se ka nkalon ye:** This statement is **TRUE**. The passage implies that the understanding of physical cues can be used to detect deception (""a be seka dɔ nin mɔgɔ dɔ be ka nkalɔn tikɛ nin a farilikolo yɛlɛma cogoya finitiw ɲɛfɔli kaɲɛ kosɛbɛ"").

*   **C: Kumakan ani ɲɛda cogoyaw ɲɛfɔlen do:** This statement is **TRUE**. The passage focuses on explaining facial expressions (""ɲɛda yɛlɛmaw cogoya ɲɛfɔlila minunw ye milisekɔndi damadami dɔrɔn"").

*   **D: A be seka dɛmɛlikɛ ka jɛlenya sɛgɛsɛgɛ:** This statement is **TRUE**. The passage mentions that people who cannot understand language due to brain damage can analyze coherence very well (""be seka jɛlenya sɛgɛsɛgɛ kaɲɛ kosɛbɛ"").

Therefore, **all the statements are true** based on the provided text. However, if the question is asking which statement is **LEAST related** to the primary focus of analyzing subtle physical cues to understand communication (including deception), then:

The answer would be **D: A be seka dɛmɛlikɛ ka jɛlenya sɛgɛsɛgɛ**

**Explanation:**

While the passage mentions that those who cannot understand language can analyze coherence, this is more of a *consequence* or an *example* of the broader point. The primary focus is on how video analysis helps us understand the physical cues themselves. The ability to analyze coherence is something that *benefits* from that understanding, but it is not the direct focus of the technological advancement of the video analysis."
Ninnu jumɛn nafa boɲana kosɛbɛ k’a sabu jɛ Renaissance ye? ,"The correct answer is **C: Mirili gafe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that before the Renaissance, ""piresiyon tɛyi tuguni mɔgɔ kelen ka mirila, nka mirili gafe la se kɛra piriyorite ba ye"" meaning individual thought was less important, but knowledge in books became the priority.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Mɔgɔ kelen ka mirila (Individual Thought):** The passage explicitly says individual thought was *less* important *before* the Renaissance.
*   **B: Dɔni ka yaala la (The spread of knowledge):** While the spread of knowledge was important during the Renaissance, the question asks what *declined* in importance *before* the Renaissance.
*   **D: Kunafoni sɔrɔli (Access to information):** Although access to information improved during the Renaissance, the passage highlights the shift from individual thought to the importance of books, which better answers the question."
"K’a sabu kɛ Renaissance ye, sinsinni dɔgɔyara ninnu jumɛn de kan?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Mɔgɔ kelen ka mirila**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Piresiyon tɛyi tuguni mɔgɔ kelen ka mirila, nka mirili gafe la se kɛra piriyorite  ba ye."" This directly translates to: ""Pressure decreased on the individual's intellect/thought, but the intellect/thought of the book became a big priority."" This indicates a shift away from sole reliance on individual intellect and towards a greater emphasis on written knowledge."
Ninnu jumɛn de tɛ kun jira ka ɛntɛrinɛti labaara jɛɲɔgɔnya min bɛ taɲɛ kama?,"Based on the provided text in Kikuyu, the question is asking which type of social connection has been influenced by the internet. The text mentions ""mĩario ya mũingĩ na ya gatagatĩ ka mũndũ na ũrĩa ũngĩ,"" which translates to public conversations and personal relationships. It also mentions ""Kũingĩrio kwa mũingi,"" which means ""inclusion of the public"" or ""community involvement.""

Now, let's analyze the Malinke options:

*   **A: Jagokɛlaw ka jɛɲɔgɔnya (Association of professionals):** While the internet *can* facilitate professional connections, the original text doesn't specifically emphasize this.

*   **B: Ka to jɛɲɔgɔnya la ni denbaya ye (From friends to family):** The Kikuyu text highlights both public/community and personal/individual connections. The internet's effect on relationships is a part of the Kikuyu statement.

*   **C: Dugu taa ɲinini (Looking for towns):** This is irrelevant to the core discussion about changes in social relationships.

*   **D: Mɔgɔ kuraw dɔnni (Learning about new people):** The Kikuyu text mentions the ways the internet has changed behaviors such as ""reading"" and ""listening"", suggesting it's a way of learning about new people.

Based on this, the best answer is **B: Ka to jɛɲɔgɔnya la ni denbaya ye**, as the internet has had an influence on our relationships.

Therefore, the final answer is **B**.
"
Ninnu jumɛn de tɛ kun jira ka ɛntɛrinɛti labaara mɔgɔ yɛrɛ sendonni kama?,"Based on the provided text (which is in Kikuyu) and the questions (in Bambara), we can infer that the questions are about the effects or uses of the internet.

Let's translate the relevant parts to understand the connection:

*   **P (Kikuyu):** ""The internet has interconnected public and private communication. Internet aspects have increased trust in issues and the exchange of gratitude. For example, 'reading' and 'listening' are some things supported by internet usage. 'Public engagement' and 'love of freedom' were mentioned by Eighmey and McCord to influence the perception of website readers and listeners.""

*   **Q (Bambara):** ""Which one of these best shows how the internet can help someone search for general information?""

Therefore, the best answer is:

*   **A: Ka dumunidɔ nafɛnw n’a tobicogo ɲini** which translates to ""Searching for information about a topic and how to resolve it"".

The passage states: ""Cɛmancɛ Waati laban yɔrɔw la, Erɔpu tilebin y'a daminɛ k'a yɛrɛ ka taabolo yiriwa."" This directly answers the question of when Western Europe began developing its own distinct style.

This translates to ""One of the major advances of that time, due to religious wars, was the construction of spires to cover the domes.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Kurucɛw ka kɛlɛw (Crusades)**.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de jatelen do inafɔ waatijan fɛɛrɛ min be se ka kɛ diɲɛ kunkow la?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: kunkow kun dɔnni** (Understanding the root causes).

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states, ""Nka nin i tɛ dile dama dama ni fura fɛ, ola anw kan ka kunbalan jujɔn ɲinin ka dɔn, ani anw kan k'u bali ka baara kɛ."" This translates to something like, ""But if we don't just treat the symptoms with medicine, we must seek to know the root causes of the problems and prevent them from operating."" This clearly emphasizes the importance of understanding and addressing the root causes of global problems.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Balocogo damatɛmɛlen sugandili boyikoteli (Boycotting unsustainable lifestyles):** While unsustainable lifestyles are mentioned as a contributing factor, the text doesn't focus solely on boycotting them as a comprehensive solution.
*   **B: Ko dɔw kɛlɛli (Fighting some things):** This is too general. The text suggests a more proactive and preventative approach than simply ""fighting"" certain things.
*   **D: Ka jɛɲɔgɔnya kɛ ni diɲɛ kɔlɔlisili kulula (Forming partnerships with global environmental organizations):** The text emphasizes understanding root causes and preventing them. It doesn't mention collaborations with environmental organizations.

Therefore, the most accurate answer, according to the text, is understanding the root causes of global problems."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de jatelen tɛ inafɔ bana tamasiyɛn furakɛli diɲɛ kungow la?","Let's analyze the passage and the answer options.

The passage states: ""P: Anw be seka balo tɛriyala nin diɲɛ ye, anw be seka dɔn diɲɛ kɔlɔlisili kulula, ani anw be seka kɛ ali o kɛlɛkɛbaw ye walasa ka kɔlɔlɔw nata dɔgɔya cogoyala. O ye dɔrɔn bana tamasiyɛn furakɛli ye ka camana.""

This translates to: ""P: We can live harmoniously with the world, we can reduce the world's pollution, and we can act as fighters to reduce the negative effects of pollution. This is often just treating the *symptoms* of the problem.""

The passage then argues that instead of just treating symptoms (like fighting pollution's immediate effects), we should address the *root causes*: ""Nka nin i tɛ dile dama dama ni fura fɛ, ola anw kan ka kunbalan jujɔn ɲinin ka dɔn, ani anw kan k'u bali ka baara kɛ.""  This means that we need to identify and prevent the root causes from operating.

Now let's consider the options:

*   **A: K’i sen don kɛlɛw la (Engaging in fights/wars):** The passage mentions acting like ""fighters to reduce the negative effects of pollution,"" but it explicitly states that *this* is symptom treatment. So, fighting to reduce immediate effects is symptom management.

*   **B: Ka kunbalan jujɔnw balili ka baara kɛ (Preventing the root causes from operating):** This is EXACTLY what the passage says is *not* symptom treatment, but addressing the underlying problem.

*   **C: Ka kumakan bila balocogo damatɛmɛlen sugandili balili ma (Focusing on preventing unsustainable consumption patterns):** This aligns with addressing root causes. The passage mentions that environmental problems are also caused by excessive population growth and unsustainable consumption practices. So this is also about dealing with root causes, not symptoms.

*   **D: Ka balo ni diɲɛ teriya cogoyaw ye kosɛbɛ (To live harmoniously with the world):**  This is a general principle and not necessarily a direct symptom treatment.

Therefore, **B (Ka kunbalan jujɔnw balili ka baara kɛ)** is the correct answer as it directly opposes the act of treating the symptoms but advocates for dealing with the root cause of the environmental problems. Option A mentions fighting environmental issues which is stated in the text to be an act of dealing with the symptoms.

**Final Answer: B**

Here's why:

The passage states that the War of the Spanish Succession demonstrated the principle of the balance of power. To maintain the balance of power and prevent France (and Spain united under one ruler) from becoming too dominant, other European powers formed alliances against them. England was a key member of these alliances. Thus, England fought Spain in the War of the Spanish Succession to uphold the balance of power.
"
Kɛlɛjumɛn de kofɔlen do kumadɔw la inafɔ ‘diinɛkɛlɛ’ laban?,"The correct answer is **A: San Bisaba Kɛlɛ**.

The passage states: ""O la sa, San Bisabakɛlɛ kɛra diinɛkɛlɛ dɔ taamasiɲɛ ye."" (Therefore, the Thirty Years' War became a symbol of religious war).
"
Nin yɔrɔ jumɛnw de la Egilizi Katoliki tun tɛ ka sɛgɛsɛgɛ?,"Based on the passage, the best answer is **A: Ni nafolomanfɛnw tilacogo tun bɛnnen don Egilisi kɔnɔ** (Whether the distribution of wealth was fair within the Church).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the church believed wealth should be used to alleviate poverty and that people questioned whether the Church in Rome, with its concentration of power and money, was fulfilling that purpose. This directly addresses the fairness of wealth distribution within the Church.

The other options are not as directly supported by the text:

*   **B: Ni diinɛ sariya jɔnjɔnw kan ka ladilan** (Whether the core religious laws needed to be amended): While the passage discusses beliefs, it doesn't focus on the need to change core religious laws.
*   **C: Sebaaya lajɛlicogo Egilizi kɔnɔ** (How obedience was collected in the Church): The passage focuses on the power and wealth of the Church, not specifically on how obedience was enforced.
*   **D: Ni Egilizi sariya jɔnjɔnw tun bɛ ka dafa** (Whether the basic church laws were being followed): This is related to A, but A is more directly and clearly addressed in the passage. The concern isn't simply about *following* rules, but about whether the Church was using its resources *appropriately* given its stated beliefs."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔn de fagara Versailles ?","The correct answer is **D: Lakanabaa dɔ**

The passage states: ""Waati dɔ selen, jaman in mɔgɔ dɔ ye Masa lakanabaa dɔ kunkolo yanga min fagara Versailles Masamuso jatigɛlen ɲɛna."" which translates to ""At one point, a person from the crowd beheaded a King's bodyguard who was killed in Versailles in front of the Queen's chambers"".
"
"Ninnu na, mun de jagoya Massakɛ ni Masamuso kan Jama fɛ?","The correct answer is **A: U ka sowotoro finɛtiriw dayɛlɛli**

The passage explicitly states that ""Jaman in ye Masakɛ ni Masamuso jakoya k'u ka sowotoro fɛlɛwow bɛɛ dayɛlɛ"" (The crowd insulted the King and Queen by forcing them to open all the windows of their carriage). Therefore, the fact that they were made to open the carriage windows is what angered the crowd and caused them to insult the King and Queen.
"
Ninnu jumɛn de sabu tɛ Beretaɲi ka bɛnkanbaliya kɔgɔjila kɛlɛ ye?,"The correct answer is **D: Fɛn nafamanbaw tun tɛ se ka sɔrɔ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Britain blockaded Germany after the outbreak of hostilities. The reason for the blockade was to cut off supplies to the Germans, essentially preventing valuable resources from reaching them. The passage also mentions the dangers to neutral ships and Germany's response of using submarines. The other options are all true according to the passage but don't directly cause the British naval blockade.
"
Kumasen jumɛn de tɛ lakilili kɛ ka ɲɛ Beretaɲi ka jisira datugu la min kɛra Alimaɲi kama?,"The correct answer is **D: A y’a sabati kurun minnu tɛ mɔgɔsi ta ye olu kana bila farati la.**

Here's why:

*   **A: A ye diɲɛlamini sariyaw sɔsɔ:** The passage explicitly states that the blockade ""sɔsɔ kosɛbɛ"" (greatly challenged) international law. So, this is a consequence mentioned in the passage.

*   **B: A ye Alimaɲi ka jijukɔrɔkɛlɛ lawuli:** The passage mentions that Germany responded to the blockade by using submarines, indicating the blockade spurred submarine warfare.

*   **C: A ye Alimaɲi ka minɛnkumabaw tɛmɛni bali:** The passage states that the British blockade aimed to ""tigɛ minɛkunbabaw"" (cut off supplies), so preventing the passage of German supplies was a direct goal of the blockade.

*   **D: A y’a sabati kurun minnu tɛ mɔgɔsi ta ye olu kana bila farati la:** The passage doesn't specify that Britain protected neutral ships, on the contrary, it explicitly states that neutral ships were at risk.

Therefore, option D is the only one that is NOT implied by the text."
"Ka da tɛmɛsira in kan, a ka c’a la mɔgɔ jumɛn de bɛ se ka sɛgɛ ko nsɛmɛ bana yer’a la?","The passage states: ""Ɲɛninili ye jira ko musow ka teli ka nzɛbɛn bana in sɔrɔ siyɛn ka tɛmɛ cɛ kan."" This translates to ""Research has shown that women are more likely to get MS than men.""

Therefore, the answer is the option with a woman. Since MS can affect people young and old, we need to choose the woman from the options.

The possible answers are:

*   A: Muso san 32 dɔ (A 32-year-old woman)
*   D: Muso san 10 dɔ (A 10-year-old woman)

Since the passage mentions that MS is a leading neurological disease in children and young adults, both ages could be susceptible, but we're looking for the option most *likely* to have MS. The passage does not indicate a higher or lower risk based on a woman's age. Either answer is possible. But based on the phrasing, we assume to choose A.

**Therefore, the best answer is A: Muso san 32 dɔ**
"
"Ka da tɛmɛsira in kan, minnu b'u sedɔn nin baara jɔlenw na olu mako bɛ dɛmɛ caman na ka ɲɛsin mun ma?","Based on the passage (P), the correct answer is **A: Dimi yeli cogojuguma**

This translates to: ""Those who recognize themselves in these stalled works need help with **severe pain management** and struggle against persistent pain and temporary episodes that cause quick escapes.""

Therefore, the passage directly indicates the need for help with severe pain management.

**D: Furakisɛ buteli furasɛbɛn**

Here's why:

The passage states that positive signs from stool samples can lead to *fura baraniw ye ani furaw bagama sɔrɔli ye* (medicinal discoveries and drug development). ""Furakisɛ buteli furasɛbɛn"" relates to medicine. The other options mention bodily symptoms or problems, while the text highlights the *positive* signs related to medicinal advancements."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, walasa ka binkɛra min kan lajɛ, baara bɛrɛbɛnnen fɔlɔ jimɛn de k'an ka kɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Ka yɔrɔ jateminɛ** (To assess the location).

The passage states: ""Walasa ka benkɛla min kan lajɛ, i kan k'a kɛ **yɔrɔ lajɛ fɔlɔ** walaka ki ka lakana sabati."" This translates to: ""In order to survey the area, you must **first assess the location** to ensure safety.""
"
"Ninnu kumasen jumɛn de tɛ ye, bin kɛra min kan k'o lajɛ cogo baaraw jira ka ɲɛ?","The best answer is **B: Ka yɔrɔ sɛgɛsɛgɛ ka kɔn bin kɛra min kan ɲɛ**.

Here's why:

* **P** (the initial statement) emphasizes the importance of first surveying the area before acting.  It states you need to ""look at the area you want to attack, you must first secure the area to ensure safety."" This directly relates to surveying the area beforehand.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Jɔrɔbaliya n'i yɛrɛ joginni ye (Fear and cowardice):** While fear *might* play a role, the statement primarily focuses on strategic planning, not emotional state.
* **C: Bin kɛra min kan ko cogoya la (The way of attacking):** While the statement touches on *how* to attack (considering terrain), it prioritizes *where* to attack *after* surveying.
* **D: Ka lajɛ ka jateminɛ kɛ dirapo bilema suguw sugu la (Looking and estimating different types of weapons):** The statement mentions different types of weapons, but it does so in the context of assessing the terrain and planning accordingly.  It's not the core focus of the passage.

Therefore, **B** most accurately reflects the primary message of prioritizing area assessment before attacking.

This directly corresponds to option B, the shift from social connections to meritocracy (ability and talent).
* Options A, C, and D are mentioned as political ideas that were present, but B is the only option that specifies the change that resulted in workers' lives during the French Revolution."
"Ka tugu Faransi Yɛlɛma la, sanga sɔrɔli kɛlɛcɛya la ani baara wɛrɛw la a ka dɔgɔn a la o tun sinsin ne bɛ mun de kan?","The correct answer is **D: Seko ni dɔnko**.

The passage states: ""O kelen kɛra kɛlɛcɛw la bawo sani jalasɔrɔ ka kɛ jɛɲɔgɔnyako ye a kɛra o waati seko ani dɔnko mugudala ye."" This translates to ""This was especially true for soldiers because before solidarity became common, it was a matter of power and ability during that time."" This directly supports that power and ability were central.

A fɔlendo ko wasa ka dɔgɔn ka ɲɛsin foroba baarada jumɛn de ma kosɛbɛ jamana yiriwalenw na?,"Based on the passage (P), the main concern is about the damage caused by transportation infrastructure and the difficulty of dealing with this damage in terms of water quality and bridge construction. This directly relates to **C: Foroba tiransipɔri (Public transportation)**.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de be se ka fɔ foroba tiransipɔri kan?","Based on the passage provided, the most appropriate answer is **C: U ye u la baara bagaw bila ka damakasi caman kɛ** (They cause a lot of damage during their operation).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""Mɔgɔw bɛɛ b'u damagasi tiransipɔri siraw cogoyala."" (People are damaging transport routes in various ways).

Let's analyze the other options:

*   A: U kanunen ka ɲɛ u ta baga bɛɛ fɛ (They are liked by everyone) - The passage says the opposite as it speaks of them damaging transport routes.

*   B: U tiɲɛnen do ka tɛmɛ ji kalite kan (They are more harmful to water quality) - The passage mentions the difficulty of identifying specific damage types related to water quality and soil, but it doesn't definitively say they are *more* harmful.

*   D: U ye fu ye jamana yiriwalen cama na (They are free in many developed countries) - The passage does not mention whether they are free or not.

Therefore, option C aligns best with the information given in the text."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn bɛ se ka gɛlɛya ka jateminɛ kɛ k’a sababu kɛ mɔbili bolila kɛcogoya tɛ seka dɔn?","The correct answer is **D: Sirikilasiyɔn Bolili**.

The passage explicitly states that ""...sirikilasiyɔn bolili kalanli ka gɛlɛ bari mɔbili bolila kɛcogoya tɛ seka dɔn 100 purusan na."" This directly links the difficulty of studying circulation patterns (sirikilasiyɔn bolili) to the incomplete knowledge of vehicle driving behavior.
"
Ninnu jumɛn de bɛ labaara walasa sirikilasiyɔn bolili be seka sɛbɛn nin mati ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Sirakunana desɛn**.

The passage states: ""Walasa ka sirikilasiyɔn bolili sɛbɛn, tuguɲɔgɔnya kɛra fɛn cogoya saba nin ɲɔgɔn cɛ: (1) bolili, (2) a bɔnɲa ani (3) a teliya. tuguɲɔgɔnya be **desɛn mirili nɔgɔya**, ani sirakunana cogogaw baaraw."" This translates to ""To describe the circulation movement, a relationship was established between three characteristics: (1) movement, (2) its size, and (3) its speed. This relationship facilitates **design thinking** and advanced algorithmic functions.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly links the process of describing circulation movement with design thinking. Options A, B, and D are not directly supported by the text.
"
Hershey ni Chase ye mun de itilize ka k'u yɛrɛ ka adayɛni dɔn? ,"The correct answer is **D: Banakisɛw**.

The passage states: ""Hershey ani Chase ye bakiterifagana walima banakisɛw nati k'u yɛrɛ ka adayɛni dɔn banakisɛ kɔnɔ"" which translates to ""Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or bacteria to inject their DNA into bacteria"".
"
Yɛlɛmali ka se ka taa bɔnaw la o dulonnen do mun na?,"Based on the passage provided, the best answer is **C: Yɛlɛmali cogoya (The type of transformation)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Yɛlɛmali be seka kɔlɔlɔ cama di ka da yɛlɛmali cogoya kan..."" which translates to ""Transformations can cause many different effects depending on the type of transformation...""
*   The passage focuses on how *different* types of transformations can have vastly different outcomes - some being safe for children, others potentially leading to cancer.
*   The other options, while potentially relevant, are not the primary factor determining whether a transformation is likely to be harmful. While the composition of the transformation, whether it can kill viruses, or if it involves a virus, are all potential factors, the key point the passage drives home is the *type* of transformation is the most important aspect.

Therefore, the type of transformation dictates its potential for harm, thus that is why transformations may cause harm."
"Ka da kunafoni dilenw kan tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ, yɛlɛma nɔ suguyaw tɛ u jigi da mun kan?","Based on the provided text (P), here's the breakdown:

*   **P states:** Mutations (Yɛlɛmali) can have several consequences depending on:
    *   The type of mutation (yɛlɛmali cogoya)
    *   The importance of the altered gene (dilan fɛn nafan)
    *   Whether the mutation involves just a missing/damaged gene (farikolobɔn dɔ bɔlen anu bugulen)
*   **The question asks:** What factors do the consequences of mutations *not* depend on, according to the passage?

Now let's examine the options:

*   **A: Nɔ bilala jɔlan fɛn hakɛ joli la:** The passage does not mention blood loss.
*   **B: Ni Nɔ bilala bɔn dɔ bɔlen ani bugulen ye:** The passage explicitly mentions this is a factor.
*   **C: Nɔbilala jɔlan fɛ min na o nafa:** The passage explicitly mentions this is a factor.
*   **D: Nɔbilala yɛlɛmamin na o cogoya:** The passage explicitly mentions this is a factor.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Nɔ bilala jɔlan fɛn hakɛ joli la**.
"
Ninnu jumɛn de tun tɛ kun ye walasa tabolow ka baa mara?,"The passage states that the reasons for domesticating goats and sheep were for ""nɔnɔ, kunsigi, sogo ani golow sɔrɔ nɔgɔyala"" (to easily obtain milk, wool, meat and hides).

* **A: U tun b’a to u bɛ sogo sɔrɔ (They were able to obtain meat):** This *is* a stated reason.
* **B: U tun bɛ bin dun k’a dalakɛɲɛ (They used to graze the herbs and plants):**  This is not explicitly mentioned as a *reason* for domestication.  While the animals certainly grazed, the text doesn't say this was the *purpose* of domesticating them.
* **C: U tun ye jɛɲɔgɔnw ye (They were friends):**  This is not mentioned.
* **D: U tun b’a to u bɛ nɔnɔ sɔrɔ (They were able to obtain milk):** This *is* a stated reason.

Therefore, the answer is **B: U tun bɛ bin dun k’a dalakɛɲɛ** (They used to graze the herbs and plants) because that was NOT explicitly stated as the *purpose* or *reason* for domesticating the animals, although they obviously would have done that anyway.
"
Gɔlifu kun ye ka mun hakɛ dɔgɔmani taa?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Woni**.

The passage describes golf as a game where the goal is to hit a ball into a hole (""wɔni"") using clubs. The aim is to do this in the fewest number of strokes (""zuwekɛra min bɔni fitini kɛ""). While ""bɔni"" (strokes) is related, the *ultimate* goal is to get the ball into the hole, making ""woni"" the most accurate answer to the question of what the *goal* of golf is.
"
"Gɔlifu tɛrɛnkan, yɔrɔ jumɛn bin tigɛlendo k’a surunya?","The passage says: ""Zuwe be kɛ bin sanfɛ ani bin min be wɔni da gɛrɛfɛ tigɛlen kokɛ fitini ani be wele green.""  This means the area where the grass is cut short is near the hole (wɔni da) and is called the green. Therefore the answer is B: Bin kɛnɛ kan
"
Jumɛn ye sɛgɛsɛgɛli kun ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka hakilina kelen walima caman dɛn kɛrɛfɛ** (To prove one or more hypotheses).

The passage states ""...sɛgɛsɛgɛli dɔ ye sɛgɛsɛgɛli ye min be nati walasa ka hakilina kelen walima fila den gɛrɛfɛ..."" which directly translates to ""research is research that is done in order to prove one or two ideas.""

Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de tɛ dɛmɛlikɛ ka dɔni ɲinini bila sira?","The passage states that the following are *part* of the scientific process:

*   Scientific methods
*   Experiments
*   Analyses
*   Research to narrow down one or two theories
*   Asking questions
*   Holding discussions

From this list, options B, C, and D (Making judgments, Narrowing down theories, and Doing research) can be seen to be components that can contribute to research efforts. This would mean that the correct answer is **A: Dɔniya fɛrɛw dɔrɔn (Scientific methods alone).** The passage mentions that scientific methods are *part* of the process, but not the *entire* process. Focusing solely on methods without the other components mentioned would hinder scientific inquiry.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kumasen jumɛn de tɛ tiɲɛ ye fiyɛnkolonw kan?","The correct answer is **C: Fiyɛnkolon caman bɛ tɛmɛ lɛri saba kan**

Here's why:

*   **P states:** Fiyɛnkolɔn fan juguma fila te tɛmɛ nɛgɛ kanɛ saban kan. This means ""The worst winds do not last more than three seconds"" (the steel cables represent seconds).

The other options are true based on the passage:

*   **A: Fiyɛnkolonw bɛ se ka fɛn bɛɛ tiɲɛ u kɛrɛfɛ:** This is evident from the descriptions of the damage winds cause (uprooting trees, lifting vehicles, etc.).
*   **B: Fiyɛnkolonw bɛ yɔrɔ fitininw gosi ka tɛmɛ fununfunun tɔw kan** The speed mentioned indicate they travel quickly.
*   **D: Fiyɛnkolon dɔw be se ka fiyɛn fili fo mayili (miles) 300 lɛri kɔnɔ:** This is stated directly in the last sentence of the passage.

Therefore, the only statement that is *not* true according to the passage is that many winds last more than three seconds. Instead, passage P states that the *worst* winds don't last more than 3 seconds."
"Ka da tɛmɛsira in kan, kumasen jumɛn de bɛ ɲɛfɔlikɛ fiyɛnkolon kan ka ɲɛ?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: A se b’u ye ka jiri bɔn ka bɔ dugukolo la** (They are able to uproot trees from the ground).

The passage explicitly states: ""Fiyɛnkolɔɔn be jirijuw bɔn"" which translates to ""Tornadoes uproot trees"". The other options are either inaccurate or not the primary focus of the description.
"

The passage states that telescopes were first truly created in Europe in the late 16th century. While humans had used lenses for a long time, the *telescope* itself is the innovation mentioned in the 16th century.
"
Kabi waati joli adamadenw bɛ fɛnw bonya ni lunɛtiw ye?,"The correct answer is **C: San ba caman**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that humans have been using lenses for magnification for a long time (""kabini san bayirikaw kɔnɔ""), which means ""for many years"" or ""for a long time"". The phrase ""san bayirikaw"" literally translates to ""hundreds of years"".
*   The other options are incorrect because they refer to the invention of the telescope specifically, not the general use of lenses for magnification.

"
"Ka da tɛmɛsira in kan, Muhamadu ka kuluwo bɛ mun fɔ kelennadeliw an’u nafaw kan?","Based on the passage, here's the breakdown of why the answer is correct:

*   The passage emphasizes Muhammad going to the cave (""Hira"" on ""Noor"" Mountain) to reflect. This act is strongly linked to his seeking solitude and contemplating his beliefs.
*   The passage emphasizes the power of the cave giving """"taamasiɲɛɲumanba di Muhammad ka kelennadeliw ma"""" which translates to giving ""good signs to Muhammad's individual prayers."" This directly connects to his solitude and prayers.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: A bɛ nafa di hɛrɛ ni kelenna toli ma** (It gives benefit to peace and individual prayer)"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, nɛgɛ tun bɛ kɛ mun de ye fɔlɔ?","Based on the passage, the answer is **C: Senw**.

The passage states that ""nege be cɛni cama kɛ wagɔn jiri senw na"" which translates to ""iron was used in many ways on wagon wooden wheels.""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, munna jiri senw falenna ka kɛ nɛgɛ senw ye?","The correct answer is **C: U tun bɛ se ka donni girinmanw ta** (They were able to carry heavier loads).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ali na sɔrɔ tirɛsira kun dilan neno ni jiri faraw ye, u kun b'ato sow minunw b'a sama ka witesi telima sɔrɔ ani **ka dɔni girimanbaw sama ka tɛmɛ sira fitini gɛlɛmaw kan** o waatila."" (So that the train's construction can be done with bricks and wood, so that the horses pulling can get a lot of speed and **carry heavy loads and cross narrow difficult tracks** at that time.) Then it says: ""Dɔnidɔni, nka, a yɛra kafɔ ko siraw kun be seka ɲɛ ka tɛmɛ o bɛ kan nin nɛgɛ bari b'u sanfɛla la. O kɛra waleya carilen ye, nka nege be cɛni cama kɛ wagɔn jiri senw na."" (Little by little, however, it appeared that the tracks would work better with the metal on top of them. It was a frequent occurrence, but the metal was constantly interfering with the wooden wheels.) So basically the metal made the trains able to carry heavier loads and perform better, but the wooden wheels were interfering with the metal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U ye dɔfara sow ka teliya kan:** While speed was a consideration, the passage initially focuses on the ability to carry heavy loads. Speed isn't the primary reason given for the shift to metal wheels.
*   **B: U tun jatelendo k’u kaɲi:** The passage doesn't state that the *wooden* wheels were considered better. On the contrary, it states they were a problem.
*   **D: U tun bɛ ka sin siraw nɛgɛw fɛ:** While the metal rails were an innovation, the question is about *why the wheels changed to metal*. The rails themselves were part of the evolution, but not the direct *cause* of the wheel change.

The passage clearly states that under Romanticism, *sigiyɔrɔ* (place/location), *laadaw* (traditions/customs), and *kokɔrɔw* (origins/ancestors) are factors that shape people.  The passage specifically emphasizes that these factors are considered more important than *sariya jajoyalen mɔgɔw kan kɛnɛkan* (externally imposed laws).

Ninnu kumasen jumɛn de tɛ jirali kɛ fɛɛrɛsiraw detɛrimizimu hakilinala bakurunba la? ,"Let's break down the passage and the questions, and then connect them to find the correct answer.

**Understanding the Passage (P - in Gĩkũyũ)**

The passage is about how social and political factors influence the development of technology (specifically, *mĩtambo ya kĩ-rĩu* which translates to 'modern technology'). It states the following key ideas:

1.  **Technology is not just about science:** The design and development of technology are rooted in many considerations related to social habits and trends.
2.  **Technology and societal structures are intertwined:** Technological advancement corresponds with social/behavioral and political issues.
3.  **Technology connects more to practical infrastructure than human nature**: Technology relates more to community development rather than individual behavior.
4.  **Example - Cars and Roads:** The example shows how cars (technology) and roads (infrastructure) are related. It also demonstrates how the proliferation of cars has wider social consequences, like increased traffic accidents that require more advanced medical technology.
5.  **Prioritization**: Roads in a state can be more helpful with fewer cars but can be improved if the structure and cost of production are taken into consideration.

**Understanding the Question (Q - in Bambara):**

""Which of the following is a key determination of the progress of the technology?""

**Understanding the Answer Choices (A, B, C, D - in Bambara):**

A: Technology is about individual behavior and beliefs.
B: Old people don't affect technology.
C: Technology affects the local community.
D: Progress of technology is not based on political authority.

**Connecting the Passage to the Question and Answers:**

The passage emphasizes the link between technology and the wider social and political context. Based on the passage, we can determine the answer as follows:

*   **A is incorrect:** The passage directly states that technology is more connected to infrastructure than human nature.
*   **B is incorrect:** The passage does not mention anything about old people affecting technology.
*   **C is correct:** The passage agrees that technology is deeply intertwined with local/community development, since people will be using the community's resources. The example of cars and roads shows how the widespread use of a technology impacts community infrastructure and wellbeing.
*   **D is incorrect:** The passage actually indicates that technology advancement corresponds with political issues, and therefore the progress of technology *is* based on political authority.

**Therefore, the correct answer is C.**

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de jɛlen tɛ nɛgɛjurunin sama fɛ?","Based on the passage:

*   **Mankan fɛgɛnman (A)** is associated with ""sanfɛ nɛgɛkuruni"" (upper string).
*   **Mankan girinman (C)** is associated with ""dugumanɛgɛkuruni"" (lower string).
*   **Daminɛli kanba la (D)** (starting at the base of the neck) is related to ""dugumanɛgɛkuruni"".
*   **Mariki dɔ be i ko sɛbɛnfuranɔrɔlan (B)** (""like the sound of a typewriter"") describes a characteristic of the lower string (dugumanɛgɛkuruni) which is ""sɛbɛnfuranɔrɔlan walema selekenaani min bobara tɛ a la"".

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Mankan fɛgɛnman** because it is not associated with ""dugumanɛgɛkuruni"" (lower string), but rather ""sanfɛ nɛgɛkuruni"" (upper string)."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn lajɛnnen do ni mankan fitini ye?","The correct answer is **C: Nɛgɛkuruni min bɛ i ko V**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Sanfɛ'nɛgɛkuruni """"bɛ i ko V dɔ..."""" (The upper bead/round is like a V).
*   The passage also says ""sanfɛ nɛgɛkuruni bɛ mankanfɛgɛnman di"" (the upper bead/round gives a small sound)

Therefore, the ""nɛgɛkuruni min bɛ i ko V"" (bead/round that is like a V) is associated with a small sound."

This translates to: ""Fossil evidence, dating back two to three million years, shows these transitional cutting activities starting with **walking** and moving towards more and more transformation.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Tama (Walking)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that hominids are different from humans in that hominids don't sever their feet naturally and walk straight, meaning that they are more upright than humans.

The other options are not directly supported by the passage, or may be general characteristics rather than specific to hominid skeletal adaptations."
Sugandili jɔlan kura yɛlɛmali bɔ suguya jumɛnna?,"The correct answer is **D: Kɛnɛkanda**.

"
Baara taa cogo jumɛn de bɛ dɔfara jɔlan yɛlɛmali kan?,"The correct answer is **C: Yɛlɛmali**.

The passage explicitly states that ""Yɛlɛmali be farikolo dilan na yɛlɛmali kura farakan"" which describes how mutation affects the building of the organism.  The other options are part of the genetic algorithm process but do not describe the creation of new mutations.

"Ka da kunnafoni dilen kan tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ, gɔn kan ka ninnu jumɛn de dun walasa k’a ka “poroteniyi ko gɛlɛya” ɲɛnabɔ?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Ntɔnw**.

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights the difficulty in digesting proteins from grains and nuts without cooking:**  ""Jiriw minunw sɔrɔkadi kosɛbɛ be kɛ puroteyiniw jiri furaburuw la ani nakɔkɔnɔ fɛnw la, nka o yɛlɛmali ka gɛlɛ dantanfɛnw ma inafɔ anw fo n'anw y'a tobi."" (Grains, nuts and vegetables have proteins but are difficult to digest unless cooked)

* **The passage then explains the ease of digesting proteins from animal sources:** ""cogoya wɛrɛla, bagan dumuniw (dugumɛniw, bubagaw, cɛfanw) yɛlɛma madi dɔrɔn, nka u be seka poretiyiniw ɲafan ma baw di amino-asidi fitini nafan be sɔrɔ mina."" (Animal based foods (caterpillars, grasshoppers, bees) are easy to digest and provide full proteins that can be broken down into essential amino-acids).

* **Ntɔnw** are insects.
* **Dugumɛniw, bubagaw, cɛfanw** are different names of Insects (caterpillars, grasshoppers, bees)

Since the goal is to overcome the ""protein ko kunbalan"" (protein deficiency), and the passage states that animal sources (such as insects) are easier to digest and provide a more complete protein source, the answer is **C: Ntɔnw (insects)**.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kunbalan jumɛn de sabu ma bɔ amino-asidi nafamanw dɛsɛli la?","Let's break down the relevant parts of the passage to find the answer:

* **""Farakan fɔlila, a ɲɛnɛbɔ baliyala be seka kɔlɔlɔ juguma nati: kɔrɔbayali gɛlɛya, dumuni nafan ma dɔn ni baliya bana, ani laban laban na saya.""** This translates to something like: ""Firstly, its unsuccessful extraction can lead to harmful consequences: growth problems, nutritional deficiencies and immune system issues, and ultimately death.""  The passage directly links extraction failure to growth problems, deficiencies, immune issues and finally death.

* The question asks what results from a *lack of essential amino acids*.  Essential amino acids are, by definition, important for growth and proper bodily functions. The deficiencies mentioned in the passage are related to failures of extraction.

Now, let's look at the answer choices:

*   **A: Dumuni yɛlɛma dakunw (Nutritional deficiencies):** This directly aligns with ""dumuni nafan ma dɔn"" (nutritional deficiencies) in the passage, which is linked to the extraction problem that arises from amino-acid deficiency.
*   **B: Balokojuguya (Malnutrition):** While related to nutritional deficiencies, this is less directly tied to the extraction problem mentioned.
*   **C: Kɔrɔbayali gɛlɛya (Growth problems):** This is directly linked to amino-acid deficiencies in the passage, making it a strong contender.
*   **D: Saya (Death):** Death is the *ultimate* consequence of the issues, but not the direct cause of the lack of amino acids.

Both A and C are linked to amino-acid deficiency, but the question asks about the *direct result*. Deficiencies impact Growth problems, immune issues and can lead to death, making ""growth problems"" the closest answer.

However, Nutritional deficiencies seem like a better answer if we're trying to identify the most *immediate* consequence of not being able to extract the amino acids.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: Dumuni yɛlɛma dakunw**. However, C, Kɔrɔbayali gɛlɛya, is a very close second. Since it is a bit more direct and encompassing, I'd now go with that answer.

**Final Answer: C: Kɔrɔbayali gɛlɛya**
"
Dugumasɛnɛ kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnenw mɔgɔw b’u ka fara ɲɔngɔnkan ya ni kulu wɛrɛ ye cogodi?,"The most appropriate answer is **C: Ni jɛnniye ni sigida kɛwalew ye (With events and community activities)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes shared identity and community:** The definition of a subculture in the passage hinges on people with similar ideas who feel excluded and develop a shared identity. Events and community activities are direct ways to strengthen this shared identity and sense of belonging.

Let's analyze why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: N’a si filɛli ye k’u ɲagamin u la (If it is observed by mixing in them):**  While observation can be a factor, it doesn't directly explain how subcultures differentiate themselves. It focuses on an external perspective rather than the internal cohesion of the group.
* **B: N’u kɛrɛfɛmɔgɔ bɛɛ ka danayaw tali ye (If everyone's restrictions are taken):** This sounds like forced assimilation which is the opposite of what a subculture does, a subculture wants to differentiate itself.
* **D: Ni finidon cogo kɛli ye tamasiyɛn sugudɔ ye (If the way of choosing symbols is hidden):** The passage doesn't suggest that symbols are hidden. Rather, they are expressed through dress, language, and behavior. While these might be *distinctive*, the passage doesn't imply secrecy or concealment.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni hakilina jiralen in ye tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ, mun de bɛ se ka denmisɛn na min b'a yɛrɛ jati siyakulu fitini dɔ fɛ min kofɔlen do k’u bɛ don bagabagali walew la?","The correct answer is **B: A ka c’a la o denmisɛn in bɛ se ka don bagabagali walew la**.

Here's why:

* **Premise P states:** Children identify with certain groups and ideologies, sometimes leading to behaviors consistent with those ideologies (even negative ones, implied by ""siyako kɔlɔlɔw kalama denmisɛniya kɔnɔ ani o siyako kɔlɔlɔ be ziye o ka tagabolo kan""). It provides an example of children identifying with a gang (siyakulu fitini) and engaging in behaviors contrary to school rules.
* **Question Q asks:** What is likely to happen to a child who identifies with a gang?

Option B directly follows from the premise. If a child identifies strongly with a group (like a gang) that engages in certain activities (implied to be negative/harmful since they are ""bagabagali walew""), that child is *likely* to also participate in those activities.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: O denmisɛn in b’a si filɛ k’a yɛrɛ tanga bagabagali walew donni ma (That child will try to avoid participating in violent acts)** - This contradicts the idea that identification with the group influences behavior.
* **C: O denmisɛn in b’a yɛrɛ bɔsi jama dalajɛw la (That child will remove themselves from public gatherings)** - While possible, this isn't the most direct consequence of identifying with a gang.  The core issue is the potential for engaging in the gang's activities, not necessarily avoiding public gatherings.
* **D: O denmisɛn in bɛ n’a ban ka don ko la ni siyakulu fitini tɔw ye (That child will refuse to participate in things with other small groups)** -  Again, possible, but not the most direct outcome. The focus is on the activities *of* the identified gang, not necessarily refusing to interact with *other* groups.

Therefore, **B** is the most logical and direct answer based on the information provided in the premise.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, denmisɛn ka bɔli kow kalama minnu kofɔlen siya kan, a bɛ se ka yɛlɛma don ninnu jumɛn de la?","The correct answer is **A: Siyakulu fitinin min n’a b’a yɛrɛ jati o fɛ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that children who identify with a minority group might not perform as well academically because they feel separated from the mainstream culture. This directly relates to how they perceive themselves within a smaller, specific group (a minority group). The passage focuses on how a child's identification with a specific minority affects performance, thus the relevant answer is A.

Let's look at why the others are less accurate:

*   **B: U jogo (Their behavior)**: While self-identification could influence behavior, the passage's primary focus is on academic performance impacted by group identity, not directly on broader behavioral changes.
*   **C: U ka jɛɲɔngɔnya ni denmisɛn wɛrɛw ye (Their relationships with other children)**: The passage indirectly touches on potential social impacts, but the central argument revolves around the challenges arising from a lack of cultural integration and self-identification within a minority group, not social relationships in general.
*   **D: U siya faamu (Their understanding of ethnicity)**: While tied to the subject matter, it's too broad as the passage centers on self-identification with a specific minority and performance rather than general comprehension."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, a ka c’a la ninnu jumɛn de basigilen tɛ denmisɛn bagannamanw lamɔnina?","Based on the passage, the characteristic *not* associated with feral children is:

**B: Kumaɲɔgɔnya dɔnni ba (Great communication skills)**

Here's why:

*   The passage describes feral children as exhibiting behaviors like fear of humans and lack of social understanding. It implies a deficit in learned human behaviors. Great communication skills would be a learned skill, not something they would likely possess.

The other options are directly related to the passage:

*   **A: Ka lamɔ a yɛrɛma (Being raised by animals):** The passage mentions cases where children are raised by animals.
*   **C: Kelenna to walew (Solitary habits):**  Being raised alone in the wild would naturally lead to solitary habits.
*   **D: Mɔgɔw ɲɛ n’u hakilina ɲɛ siranɲɛ (Fear of humans and their behavior):** The passage specifically states feral children often exhibit fear and indifference towards humans.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""O denmisɛni bagan namaw dɔw kun datugula so u ka mɔgɔ fɛ (waaticamala u yɛrɛ bangebaw fɛ); o ka dɔw ra nin denmisɛni fili sababu kun ye bangebaw bani ye denimɛni nalon man walima lujuratɔra la."" This translates to ""Some of these feral children were locked up at home by people (often their own parents); others were abandoned due to unwanted pregnancies or luxury."" While other factors contribute, being locked up at home is mentioned as directly leading to feral behaviors.
*   The other options are incorrect:

    *   A: While luxury (lujura) is mentioned as a reason for abandonment, it's not stated as the cause of ALL feral behaviors.
    *   B: While danger is a factor, it is only mentioned as one possible cause.
    *   D: This option is incorrect. While bad pregnancies can lead to abandonment, it's not the sole cause for why feral children exist."
"Ka da tɛmɛsira in kan, nin wale jumɛn de basigilen tɛ ni baloɲini sɛnɛ?","Based on the passage, the characteristic that is *not* associated with subsistence farming is:

*   **C: Ka sinsin sɔrɔ caman kan n’o ye fɛɛrɛ ɲɛtaalenw fɔnkɔɲɔgɔn ye (Focusing on high yields by using advanced technologies)**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions that subsistence farming is a ""simple system"" that focuses on ""simple technology."" This contrasts directly with the idea of using advanced technologies to maximize yields.

The other options are all compatible with subsistence farming:

*   **A: Ka sinsin sɔrɔ kan min bɛ sɛnɛkɛla ka denbaya makow ɲɛ (Focusing on obtaining enough to meet the farmer's family needs)**: This is a primary goal of subsistence farming.
*   **B: Ka dumuni dilan k’a feere tɔw ma (Producing food to sell to others)**: While subsistence farmers primarily grow for their own needs, they may sell surplus.
*   **D: Sumansiw sɔrɔli minnu ye sɛnɛkɛla ka yɔrɔ ta ye (Obtaining the resources needed to keep the farmer's land)**: Self-sufficiency is a characteristic.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**."

Here's why:

*   The passage states that intensive farming uses techniques and labor to ""maximize yields."" This aligns perfectly with option B.
*   Option D is also true, but it is not the most accurate description of what intensive farming *is*."
"Ka ta bɔ fɛnkɔrɔmaraso la, o bɛ jate turisimu suguya jumɛn fɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Yɔrɔtabolodɔn turisimu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines ""yɔrɔtabolodɔn yɔrɔlajɛ"" as visiting a specific place to learn about its history and culture.** Going to a historical site aligns perfectly with this definition.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Baara turisimu (Business tourism):**  This involves travel for work or professional purposes, not exploring history.
* **B: Yɛrɛɲɛba turisiw turisimu (Mass tourism):** While historical sites can be popular, the passage doesn't suggest the defining characteristic is *mass* tourism. The focus is on the *purpose* of the trip.
* **D: Kɛnɛma turisimu (Outdoor tourism):**  While some historical sites might be outdoors, that's not the defining reason for visiting them in this context. The primary motivation is learning about history and culture.

This translates to: ""It is a time when people go to a place that offers a different kind of daily life in order to relax and enjoy themselves."" This explicitly mentions relaxation as a key motivation for tourism.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Ka u yɛrɛ don tabolow kɔnɔ kosɛbɛ (To immerse themselves in cultures):** While the passage mentions cultural tourism, it's not the primary or sole motivation for all tourists.
*   **C: Yɔrɔ nafamanw lajɛli (Visiting interesting places):** This is a general description of tourism, but not the core reason why people engage in it.

*   It goes on to say: *""O taɲɛ tariku in be yɛlɛmali jɔrɔ dɔgɔya, nin tabolo ɲuman natili ye ka ɲɛsin sinin yɛlɛmali ma.""* (This historical understanding reduces the resistance to change, and the natural structure of this helps to respond to future changes.)

Therefore, understanding the history of the church (jɛkulu) is directly linked to reducing resistance to change (yɛlɛma ɲɛsiranɲɛ) within it.

While the other options might be indirectly related, they are not as directly supported by the passage as option C."
Ninnu kumasen jumɛn de bɛ posimodɛrini mɔgɔw ka kalanfɛrɛ ɲɛfɔ ka ɲɛ?,"The best answer is **D: Fɛnw tɛ kalan na minnu ye kelen ye fan bɛɛ walima minnu tɛ yɛlɛma (Things that are singular and unchanging are not education.)**

Here's why:

* **The passage criticizes the idea of a single, unchanging truth in education.** It argues against the notion that education should be about passively accepting information from a fixed source.
* **The passage emphasizes the interaction between the learner and the knowledge being presented.**  It suggests that learning should be a dynamic process of self-reflection and engagement with the information.
* **The example of passively watching TV documentaries illustrates the problem.** The passage argues that this kind of passive learning doesn't truly empower individuals to understand or engage with the world around them.
* **Option D directly addresses this rejection of fixed and unchanging knowledge.** The passage highlights the rejection of the notion of solely learning one thing without consideration of other perspectives or the learner's context.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kalan kɛcogo dɔw nafa ka bon ni dɔw tɔw ye (Some ways of learning are more valuable than others):** While the passage implies this, it's not the core point. The main concern is about *what* is being learned and *how* it's being engaged with, not simply the method of learning.
* **B: Kalan kan ka sinsin fɛnw kan an dalen b’a la k’an bɛna minnu kɛ (Education should focus on things we believe we will do):** This is too narrow and practical. The passage is more about a philosophical approach to knowledge itself.
* **C: Kalan kɛ cogo dɔw ka fisa nin dɔw ye (Some ways of teaching are better than others):** Similar to A, this is about *how* to learn rather than the central critique of a singular truth.

Here's why:

*   **The passage argues *against* the idea that we should only learn practical skills.** It criticizes programs that prepare us for specific jobs, implying we lose the ability to understand broader concepts or engage in activities outside those defined roles (driving, plumbing, exploring ancient sites).

*   Options A, B, and C are all consistent with the passage's critique of limiting education and embrace of multiple viewpoints on knowledge:
    *   **A: Kunafoni be se ka kalan cogoya caman de la:** aligns with the idea that there are multiple ways of learning.
    *   **B: Dɔnni cogoyadɔw k’an ka bila dɔw sanfɛ:** acknowledges the selective use of knowledge, a concern raised in the passage.
    *   **C: Kalan cogoya sɛmɛnen do kalanden ani dɔnni jiralen:** refers to the exchange between learner and source of knowledge.

Therefore, the statement that *doesn't* fit the passage's point of view (and is therefore the correct answer) is D, as it suggests that learning only things that are readily applicable is not sufficient, which is precisely what the passage argues."

*   The question asks what is directly related to this practice of sleep snatching.

Given this, the best answer is:

*   **C: Ka alarimu faga i ka tabalikan ani ka segin ka sunɔgɔ miniti mugan kofɛ** - This aligns perfectly with the description of sleep snatching involving waking up for short periods and going back to sleep.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes:** Sleep inertia involves intentionally disrupting sleep during a normal cycle and then returning to sleep after a short period (10-60 minutes). The text suggests using alarms or scheduled drinking to interrupt sleep.

* **Why the other options are correct based on the text:**
    * **A: A be se ka da dɔgɔn dɔn tabolokan (It can rely on scheduled drinking):** The passage mentions using scheduled drinking to wake up.
    * **B: A kun de y’i kan’i yɛrɛ pewu (The goal is to wake yourself up gradually):** The passage mentions that waking yourself up can lead to grogginess and a desire to return to bed. This implies the goal is to avoid a sudden, jolting awakening.
    * **C: A baara bɛ kɛ i ka sunɔgɔ nɔrɔmali waati la (It works during your normal sleep cycle):** The passage explicitly states that sleep inertia involves disrupting a *normal* sleep cycle.

* **Why option D is incorrect:** The passage specifies a shorter period of wakefulness (10-60 minutes) before returning to sleep, not two hours.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nin fenomɛnini kun jɔnjɔn  ye suko jɔlenw jaabi min be **waati janya nɛtugu ka dayɛlɛw ni ɲɔgɔn cɛ**.""

This directly translates to: ""The main reason for this phenomenon is the response of sleeping neurons, which depends on **the duration of time intervals between neuronal activations**.""

Therefore, the key factor influencing the clarity of dreams formed during sleep is the *duration* of the intervals between neuronal activations.

Suko jɔlen be se ka ni nɔ jugu jumɛn bila farikolola?,"The correct answer is **B: Ɲɛtugu ka dayɛlɛ teliman dɔgɔyali sufɛ** (Decrease of network openings/connections at night).

* **The passage states:** ""...fenomɛnini kun jɔnjɔn  ye suko jɔlenw jaabi min be waati janya nɛtugu ka dayɛlɛw ni ɲɔgɔn cɛ. Nin nɛtugu ka dayɛlɛw dama damani ɲɔgɔn cɛ su kɔnɔ...""  This directly translates to the core phenomenon of the described issue being the way network openings are affected during the night within the connections between the brain cells. It implies the connection weakens, decreasing the number of open connections.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ɲɛtugu ka dayɛlɛ teliman cogoyaw dɔgɔyali** (Decrease of network openings/connections numbers): While true in principle, this doesn't specify *when* this decrease occurs. The passage emphasizes the night-time effect.
* **C: Sirili jɔlen sunɔgɔ la** (Continuous sleep disruption): This is a consequence of the core problem, not the direct physiological effect described in the initial part of the passage.
* **D: Ɲɛtugu ka dayɛlɛ teliman caya sufɛ** (Increase of network openings/connections at night): This is the opposite of what the passage describes.

Therefore, only option B directly addresses the core problem: the decrease in network connections specifically at night due to the described phenomenon related to sleeping position.

This highlights the flexibility in work hours for virtual teams. While it implies traditional teams *may* also have some flexibility, the passage emphasizes it much more for virtual teams.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sigi kɛlen do n’a ye kulu fila bɛɛ ka baara kɛ hakɛ kelen na:** The passage doesn't address the amount of work done, only the flexibility of *when* the work is done.
*   **C: Kulu fila bɛɛ bɛ ɲɛfɔlikɛ marabaga yebali ye:** The passage mentions ""kulu yɛbali"" (virtual teams), but not that BOTH types of teams lack direct supervision.
*   **D: Kulu fila bɛɛ bɛ baara kɛ yɔrɔminnu lɛri ye kelen ye:** The passage discusses the variability in when the work is done but doesn't say both types of teams have a fixed set of working hours. The opposite, in fact, is implied for virtual teams.

*   **The passage states:** Internet-based groups are governed by the same management and work ethic principles as face-to-face groups, with minor differences.

*   **Analyzing the Options:**

    *   **A:** ""A ka c’a la kɛnɛkan kuluw mara nin ni baraɲumankɛ kosɛbɛ"" - The passage says they're governed by the ""same"" management and work ethic principles. So, they are very similar. This statement is likely true, but we need to find the *false* one.
    *   **B:** ""Ɛntɛrinɛti sanfɛ kuluw bɛ baara kɛ tumadɔw la inafɔ kɛnɛkan kuluw ka ɲɔgɔnsɔrɔyɔrɔ"" - The passage indicates online groups have more flexibility in meeting times to share information than in person groups. This statement is likely true.
    *   **C:** ""Kɛnɛkan kuluw waati ka dɔgɔn ka tɛmɛ ɛntɛrinɛti sanfɛ kuluw ta kan"" - The passage states that online groups have more flexibility to meet at different times which face to face groups don't have the ability to. Therefore this statement is false.
    *   **D:** ""Yɔrɔminnu tɛ lɛri kelen na, ɛntɛrinɛti sanfɛ kuluw be se k’olu nafa"" - The text states online groups have the ability to hold meetings at a variety of times. Therefore this is a true statement.

Here's why:

*   **P** focuses on *pre-existing* needs and desires that influence behavior once someone reaches adulthood. It highlights how these ingrained needs and desires shape choices and actions.
*   **A** introduces the idea of *new* desires arising in adulthood. While adults certainly develop new wants and needs, the main theories mentioned (Maslow and Herzberg) are more concerned with the fundamental needs that influence motivation, many of which are thought to be formed earlier in life.
*   **B, C, and D** are all aspects that the prompt implies are important factors in how people are influenced by internalized needs and desires."
Ninnu jumɛn tɛ tila sabannan sariya fɛn ye?,"The question is asking which of the options is NOT a component of the ""third of thirds"" rule.

P describes the ""third of thirds"" rule as a compositional guideline for photography. It suggests dividing the image into a grid and placing key elements along these lines or at their intersections. This is done to create balance and visual interest.

Now let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Basigiyɔrɔ dɔ dilanni yɔrɔ minna fɛn be se ka bila yɔrɔminna (Creating a focal point where things can be placed in a certain spot)**: This aligns with the rule of thirds, as intersection points are considered strategic places for focal points.

*   **B: Ka ja in ɲɛnɛmaya ani k’a barika (To improve the beauty and strength of the image)**:  While the rule of thirds can contribute to beauty, this statement is a general effect rather than a specific component.

*   **C: Ka fɛn to yɔrɔ jɔnjɔn ɲuman dɔ la (To put things in a good initial place)**: This describes the result or aim of the rule rather than the process itself. The grid helps in placing objects effectively.

*   **D: Ka ja fɛnw bɛnɲɔgɔnya (Harmony of image elements)**: Balance/Harmony within the photo. This is what the rule of thirds aims for

Based on this, **B** and **C** are the least directly related to the specific guidelines of the rule of thirds. However, between B and C, **C** is MORE directly implied with the rule of thirds. The goal is to place something in a good location, and the rule of thirds is supposed to help with that. While B is a general result, it is not directly part of the process.

Therefore, the best answer is **B**.

*   **A: A bɛ ka dilan hali sisan (It is still being made):** The passage explicitly states ""A be dilan hali bi-bi in na..."" (It is still being made even now). So, this *does* describe 35mm film.

*   **B: A tara jatalan nimeriki yanganw fɛ (It was surpassed by digital format):** The passage indicates that information from it was carried through jatalan nimeriki yanganw. So this *does* describe 35mm film.

*   **C: A bonya yɛlɛmali cogoya ka ca ni yanga tɔw caman ta ye baara bɛ kɛ minnu na (Its size changes more often than many other formats in use):** The text doesn't suggest the 35mm format's size is being changed more. It just states other formats like APS are closer to sharing information or getting ruined.

*   **D: Yangan min ka ca diɲɛ kɔnɔ n’a bɛɛ ye o de do (It is the most popular format in the world):** The passage does not state that 35 mm film is the most popular format in the world.

Therefore, the answer is **C**. The passage does not contain any information about the size of 35mm changing frequently."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, komi dilannikɛlaw bɛ ka kuntilenna ɲumanw dilanni caya, samali kuntilennaw fisayara cogodi?","The correct answer is **C: Ja ɲɛ ni kuntilenna minnu sinsin yɔrɔ janya ni dansigilen b’a la de ye kelen ye**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nin de ye a to zoom be se ka jaa dɔw bɔ min suguya be kaɲa ni suguya ye min sɔrɔla ni fokali janɲa kuntilenɲa ye."" This translates to: ""This is what allows the zoom to capture images with a quality comparable to that obtained with a fixed focal length lens.""
* **Option C** directly reflects this statement, indicating that the image quality, in terms of focus and clarity, is similar between zoom lenses and fixed focal length lenses.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Zoom lenses do not influence the aperture or speed of a lens, the passage says zooms tend to have lower/slower apertures
*   **B:** The passage states that the zoom lenses are more problematic in low light conditions: ""...zumew da dumanw be labarali be gƐlɛya yeelen fƐgƐman lahalayaw la...""
*   **D:** The passage indicates the opposite, saying zooms are harder to make than fixed focal lenses: ""Zooms kɔlɔ ye fokali gƐlƐya ni kuntilenna fƐn minw hakƐka kan yasa fokaliw cƐjanɲa gamu sɔrɔ kaɲi kɔsɔbƐ ka TƐMƐ kuntilenna folow kan."""
"Ka da tɛmɛsiran in kɔnɔ kunafoni kan, tuma jumɛn zoom lentiyew bɛ se ka fusaya ka tɛmɛ kuntilen fɔlɔw kan?","The correct answer is **D: N’i bɛ ka fokali gɛlɛya wɛrɛ ɲini (If you are looking for other focal lengths)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Zooms kɔlɔ ye fokali gƐlƐya ni kuntilenna fƐn minw hakƐka kan yasa fokaliw cƐjanɲa gamu sɔrɔ kaɲi kɔsɔbƐ ka tƐmƐ kuntilenna folow kan"" which translates to: ""The advantage of zooms is that they offer a range of focal lengths, which makes the focal length range much better than prime lenses.""

This directly implies that the primary reason to choose a zoom lens is to have more flexibility in focal length compared to a prime lens.

Nin fɛn jumɛn kelen tɛ se ka jate Misitisisimi bugunatigɛ hakika fɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Misitisisimi mantow bɛ diinɛtiɲɛ ɲini**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Mysticism as a search for truth, understanding, and connection through personal experience, reason, and exploration.** While it might sometimes *critique* established religions or traditions, its primary goal is not destruction (""diinɛtiɲɛ"" - religious destruction). It's about seeking a deeper understanding.

Let's examine why the other options are consistent with the description of Mysticism:

*   **A: Sinsin kɛlen bɛ mɔgɔ ka bɛn ani nisɔndiya hakililatigɛ kan:** The passage explicitly states that Mysticism emphasizes personal interpretation, acceptance, and joy.
*   **C: A bɛ se kɛ Misitisisimi kalandenw bɛ waleya dɔw kɛ minnuw b’a to u hakili bɛ Alako tiɲɛ famu:** The passage says that mystics ""take certain methods and practices that aim to reveal these understandings,"" implying rituals or practices to aid understanding.
*   **D: Ka sinsin i yɛrɛ kelen pe ka faamuya-ɲininin kan o bɛ se ka sanka diinɛ ani batoko canman wɛrɛw ma:** The passage makes clear that Mysticism's emphasis on individual experience differentiates it from other religions that rely on dogma or established beliefs."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, nin fɛn jumɛnw dɔlakelen tɛ Misitisisimi kuntilenna dɔ ye?","The correct answer is **B: Diinɛkosɛgɛsɛgɛli ɲuman ɲinili sigida mɔgɔw ka dɔɔnintilennen na**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that mysticism seeks ""dɔnnitilennni, hakilina, walema diinɛkosɛgɛsɛgɛli/alakosɛgɛsɛgɛli walema jowsɛgɛsɛgɛli ɲɛɲini"" – knowledge, understanding, religious/spiritual exploration, or philosophical exploration. The passage doesn't specifically mention that it is a good religious exploration in the common/public context.

The other options align with the description of mysticism provided:

*   **A: Sɔmin ɲinini diinɛkotiɲɛ la**: Seeking insight on spiritual matters aligns with seeking knowledge (dɔnnitilennni), which is a part of mysticism.
*   **C: Sinsinni hakilikunu kan min bɛ nunsɔndiya nati**: Emphasis on personal spiritual experience through the mind, which includes compassion, is a key element of mysticism.
*   **D: Ka Alako danaya ɲininin**: Seeking religious awareness, or the knowledge of God/spirituality, aligns with the definition of mysticism.

So, option B is the only one that doesn't directly reflect the characteristics of mysticism described in the passage."

Therefore, someone who is already very skilled at origami (option B) would not need the benefits of Pureland origami as much. The other options are not correct because someone who enjoys making multiple folds (A), is working on complex origami (C), or has physical limitations (D) would benefit from the simpler nature of Pureland origami.

Nin fɛnw dɔlakelen jumɛn tɛ Purelans origami bugunatigɛ jaati?,"The correct answer is **A: A dabɔlen bɛ kurulikɛla kɔrɔw de kama** (It is made for experienced origamists).

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** Purelans origami was designed to help new or struggling origamists.
*   **Option A** directly contradicts this statement.
*   **Option B** is correct because the passage says:""kuruli gɛlɛnmanw ma daga inafɔ kuruli wolokilen"".
*   **Option C** is correct because the passage says:""yɔrɔ ɲɔgɔnmanw de be kuruliw bɛɛ la.""
*   **Option D** is correct because the passage says:""walasa ka kurulikɛla kuraw dɛmɛ walima minnu lujuralen do"".

Therefore, option A is the only one that is NOT a characteristic of Pureland origami based on the given text."
"Kakɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, yɔrɔ jumɛn sɛn tɛ Indus ka Badingɛ Tabiya la?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Harappa is the name some people give to the Indus Valley Civilization *because* it was one of the first sites discovered. Harappa is a *part* of the Indus Valley Civilization, not a separate place where the civilization *isn't* located.
*   The passage specifically mentions that the civilization was located in the regions of Afghanistan, India and Pakistan.

The other options represent areas associated with the Indus Valley Civilization."
Nin fɛnw dɔlakelen jumɛn tɔgɔ ma fɔ tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ min be se ka kɛ kurukanfolon Tabiya tɔgɔ ye?,"The correct answer is **D: Indus Badingɛ Tabiya**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions ""Indus ka kurukanfolon tabiya"" then lists ""Indus-Sarasvati tabiya"" and ""Harappan tabiya"" as potential alternative names.
*   It also mentions ""Indus Badaw"" referring to the Indus valley where the civilization flourished.

The passage *never* refers to ""Indus Badingɛ Tabiya"", so that's the one name that is not mentioned as a possible name for the civilization."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, nafakuntalajan bɛ sɔrɔ nin fɛn jumɛn kelen na?","The correct answer is **A: Ka baara kɛ ni ɔ ye (To work with others)**.

The passage P directly states ""mɔgɔw cama bena ye ko ka nafan kuntakalajan ye ka baara kɛ nin tɔw ye"" which translates to ""many people will see that the biggest benefit is working with others."" Therefore, option A accurately reflects the passage's message.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mɔgɔ bese ka nin fɛnw jumɛn kelen bila ɲɛfɛ n’a ka laɲini ye nafa teliman ye?","Based on the provided passage (P), the answer is **D: Ɲɛngoya (Innovation)**.

Here's why:

* **P mentions:** ""Wasabaliya ani ɲɛngoya bena kɛ nin anw waatibɛla ani o ye sigiɲɔgɔnkan cogoya ye ko nin mɔgɔ cama be nafan sɔrɔ ala, nafan camaw bena sɔrɔ waatifitini kɔnɔ nin baarakɛliye nin ɲɛngoya ye.""  This translates to something like: ""Expertise and innovation will be used in our era, and it is a cooperative method so that many people benefit, many benefits will be obtained in a short time with the collaboration and innovation.""
* The passage explicitly states that *innovation* leads to numerous benefits in a short time, along with collaboration.
* The question (Q) asks which of the listed items should be prioritized to achieve rapid benefits.

Therefore, **ɲɛngoya (innovation)** aligns most directly with the text's emphasis on achieving benefits quickly.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni nin tɛmɛsira ye, jɔn ye kɛlɛ musakaw fanba sara?","The correct answer is **D: Filipinikadenw**.

The passage states that ""Ameriki ka benkannikɛlɛ musaka ka Filipini minɛ bɔra Filipinikadenw yɛrɛ fɛ."" This directly translates to ""The costs of the American occupation were extracted from the Filipinos themselves.""
"
Waati jumɛn kɔna diinɛkɛlɛcɛw ka tile ɲɛ?,"The passage states that ""Tile minna ko nunuw kɛra be wele forobala ko Sanfɛ Cɛmancɛ Waati, Erɔpu tariku waati sankɛmɛsigi 11na, 12na ni 13na (san 1000-1300 Yesu bangeli kɔfɛ)."" This means the Crusades occurred during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries, which falls under the High Middle Ages. While the question asks ""when did the Crusades take place,"" the most accurate answer is:

**C: Sanfɛ Cɛmancɛ Waati Daminɛ**

This is because the High Middle Ages began after the Early Middle Ages, and the passage implies it occurred from the 11th to 13th centuries. However, since it includes centuries from beginning to end, and not any individual one, it is safest to say the High Middle Ages **began** around this time.
"
Waati jumɛn fɔra diinɛkɛlɛcɛw ka tile kɔ?,"The correct answer is **C: Sanfɛ Camancɛ Waati**.

The passage states that the crusades happened during the period called the High Middle Ages.
"
Furakɛli suguya walima furakɛli sira jumɛn tɔgɔ m’a fɔ ni furakɛlikɛlaw ani farali furakɛlifaw tun bɛ baara kɛ n’a ye Roman Fanga waati?,"The passage mentions:

*   Use of pain relievers like morphine (from poppy seeds) and hyoscopolamine (from henbane seeds).
*   Surgery to remove splinters from battle victims.
*   Stopping bleeding by applying astringents and ligatures.

Considering these points, here's an analysis of the options:

*   **A:** While ""Jawilibana"" (presumably referring to surgery) is mentioned, the option includes ""treatment with many types of pain relievers"" which is true.
*   **B:** Correct. The passage directly states that hyoscopolamine was extracted from henbane seeds.
*   **C:** Correct. The passage states they addressed bleeding by ligating blood vessels.
*   **D:** Correct. The passage states that they performed surgery to remove splinters.

Since more than one option is directly supported by the passage, the best answer is:

**A, B, C and D**"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni nin tɛmɛsira in ye, nin fɛnw jumɛn kelen ma kɛ furakɛli ɲɛtaw nɔ ye Roman fangamara waati?","Let's analyze the passage to determine which option wasn't a direct result of Roman Imperial rule's advancement in medicine.

*   **A: Furakɛli baarakɛbolow sigili senkan:** The passage explicitly states that medical personnel started working under Emperor Augustus and established the first Roman medical corps to function after battles. This directly resulted from Imperial rule.

*   **B: Fanga ka kɛlɛlɛmarahakilina fɛɛrɛw:** The passage begins by stating that Roman military thought helped them advance in medical treatment, and battle surgeons performed surgery to save people from battle. This is a direct result of military thought.

*   **C: Furakɛlikɛkalansow sigili senkan:** This is **NOT** explicitly mentioned in the passage. It discusses the establishment of a medical corps and advancements in surgical techniques and pain management, but not the establishment of formal medical schools.

*   **D: Furakɛlikɛlaw tali baara la fangamasa fɛ:** The passage says, ""Furakɛlikɛlalaw y'a daminɛ ka ta baara la Fangamasa Augustus fɛ."" This directly resulted from imperial rule.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Furakɛlikɛkalansow sigili senkan.**"
Yeli se sirilendon fɛn jumɛn la?,"The correct answer is **A: Yeli fasajuruw**.

The first sentence of the passage directly states that a lajɛlin (meeting) or ""lajɛli se sirileno"" (meeting place) is ""yeli fasajuruw fanw la"" (among the parts of presentation tools) or ɲɛdenw (slides). Therefore, ""Yeli se sirilendon fɛn jumɛn la?"" (What does the meeting place consist of?) is best answered by ""Yeli fasajuruw"" (Presentation tools).
"
ɲɛ dilani cogoya caya fan nin ɲɔgɔncɛ o sirilen do fɛn juman la?,"The correct answer is **B: Baarakɛ fan ka laɲini** (The goals of the organization).

Here's why:

* **P** states that different design methods exist and that the goal of organizations and their departments influences the design. This directly links the variety in page design to the organization's goals.
* **Q** asks what influences the variety of page design.

The other options are less directly linked:

* **A: Funufunu janya fɛgɛyali (Reducing complexity):** While good design often aims for simplicity, it's not the *primary* driver of design variety as stated in the passage.
* **C: Lajɛli ɲuman cogoya (The quality of the meeting):** While a good design contributes to a good meeting, the passage focuses on the design itself and its drivers, not the outcome of the meeting.
* **D: Baarakɛfan ka misɛnya (The small size of the organization):** The size of the organization is not mentioned in the passage."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni nin tɛmɛsiran ye, nin Sikhism kun kan kuma jumɛn tɛ diinɛ in bugunatikɛ faasi?","The correct answer is **B: Guru ye Sikhism sinsinbereba min tɛ sɔrɔ diinɛ fosi wɛrɛ kɔnɔ**.

Here's why:

* **A: Sikhism bɔra Ɛndu lada kɔnɔ kabilabolofara dɔ ka bolofara la:** The passage explicitly states this: ""A bɔra Punjab mara la kɛmɛsi 15na waati ka bɔ kabila bolofara dɔ ka diinɛ bolofara dɔ la Hindu laada kɔnɔ.""
* **C: Gunuw kɔnɔntɔn ye ɲɔgɔn falen diinɛ in sigibaga, Guru Nanak, kɔfɛ:**  The passage states: ""Diinɛ in bangera kɛmɛsi 15nan na Guru Nanak fɛ (1469-1539). Guru 9 wɛrɛw ye ɲɔgɔn falen.""
* **D: Sihkism laadaw dɔw jubɔra Henduyisimi na:**  The passage states: ""Sikhs bɛ u ka diinɛ danfara ka bɔ Hinduyisimi na ka diinɛ dannan hali ni a sɔrɔ u bɛ a dɔn ko a ju ni a laadaw bɔra Hinduyisimi na.""

Option B is incorrect because while the passage explains the importance of Gurus in Sikhism, it *also* mentions that Gurus exist in other Indian religions. Therefore, the statement that Gurus are unique to Sikhism isn't accurate based on the information provided.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni nin tɛmɛsira in ye, nin fɛnw kele jumɛn be se ka jate nafɔ Sikh diinɛ sinsinbereba dɔ?","The correct answer is **A: Guru miirina** (Guru tradition).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Guru ye Ɛndi diinɛw bɛɛ sinsinbeereba ye guru ye nka Sikhism na a ye nafan dɔ sɔrɔ min bɛ kɛ Sikhs ka danayabakuruba ye."" This clearly indicates that the Guru tradition is a core and defining aspect of Sikhism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ɛndu laadaw (Hindu traditions):** While the passage mentions that Sikhism originated from a segment within Hinduism and acknowledges that its roots and traditions are derived from Hinduism, it also states that Sikhs differentiate their religion from Hinduism. So, while influential, Hindu traditions are not the most fundamental aspect.
*   **C: Ka ban ka Ɛndu diinɛ wɛrɛw dɔn (Refusing to acknowledge other Hindu religions):** The passage does not say anything about Sikhs refusing to acknowledge other Hindu religions. It only states that they differentiate their religion from Hinduism.
*   **D: Ka Punjabi kan fɔ (Speaking the Punjabi language):** While the term for Sikhism (""Gurmat"") is in Punjabi, and the religion originated in the Punjab region, the language itself is not the defining fundamental aspect of the religion.

"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Jatekɛminɛbaliya Bana bɛ denmisɛnni minnu na, a bɛ se ka gɛlɛya u ma k’u sinsin mun de kan?","The correct answer is **A: Kalanso baaraw**.

The passage states: ""Jatekɛminɛbaliya Bana be denmisɛni minunw na be gɛlɛya sɔrɔ walasa ko ɲɛsin fɛnw ma inafɔ lɛkɔli baara..."" This directly translates to: ""Attention Deficit Disorder causes difficulty for children to focus on things such as school work...""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, munna Jatekɛminɛbaliya Bana bɛ denmisɛnni minnu na u bɛ to ka farati walew kɛ?","The correct answer is **D: K’u hakili nisɔndiya**.

The passage states: ""U denmisɛniw b'u yɛrɛ do kunbalan cama na bari u be dɔn """"farati kow la, kɛlɛw la, fagan sɔsɔ baaraw la"""" walasa ka hakili nisondiya ba bari u hakili tɛ nisondiya nin fɛɛrɛ nɔrɔmaliw ye.""

This translates to: ""These children often put themselves in dangerous situations because they engage in """"risky activities, fights, aggressive acts"""" in order to feel good because their minds do not find satisfaction in normal ways.""

Therefore, children with Jatekɛminɛbaliya Bana engage in risky behaviors to feel good (nisondiya), making option D the correct answer.
"
"Ka da kunafoni dilen kan tɛmɛsir in kɔnɔ, ninnu jumɛn de tɛ dɛmɛli kalan misali ye?","Based on the passage, let's analyze each option:

*   **The passage states that tutoring assists people learning something new like ""computer programs or starting a new project.""** This aligns with the description of tutoring helping people learn new concepts.
*   **The passage explicitly mentions that tutoring is NOT a teaching method but assistance for learning new things.** SAT prep is more aligned with exam preparation and reinforcement of existing knowledge rather than introducing entirely new concepts.
*   **This fits the description of assisting in specific learning situations, which the passage considers tutoring.**
*   **This also fits the description of assisting in specific learning situations, which the passage considers tutoring.**

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: SAT kalanfa**"
Ninnu jumɛn de tɛ dɛmɛli kalan hakilina ɲɛfɔ ka ɲɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: A dɔn ne fɛnɛ do inafɔ kalancɛcogo min sinsinnen do baara dɔ kan** (It is similar to a learning method that is based on a job).

Here's why:

*   **P states**: ""Dɛmɛli kalan sirafɛ tɛ kalan fɛɛrɛ ye nka dɛmɛ min be dɔn mɔgɔw ye minunw beka kalan kura kɛ inafo oridinatɛri porogaramu dɔ natili walima porozɛ kura dɔ daminɛli."" Which means assistance in learning isn't a learning method but rather assistance given to people who are learning something new such as learning a new program on the computer or starting a new project.
*   **A, B, and D** are all supported by the information in the paragraph. Therefore, they are true and not the correct answer."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, MySpace baarakɛcogo jumɛn be se ka kalandenw dɛmɛ kalanjɛ ka gɛlɛn minnu ma?","The correct answer is **C: Ɛntɛrinɛti ladɛrɛsi kelen**

Here's why:

The question in Bambara asks which feature of MySpace (as described in the passage) helps students who have learning difficulties. The passage in Kikuyu says:

*   ""...Page ĩno no ĩkinyĩrĩke na ihenya na njĩra ya kũheana rũrenda o rũmwe, ũndu ũrĩa ũhotithagia kũririkana kwa na ihenya, na gũteithia arutwo arĩa mena thĩna wa gũtũmira keyboard kana gũthondeka maritwa.""

Translation of the relevant part: ""This page can be accessed quickly by providing a single link, which facilitates quick memorization and helps students who have difficulty using the keyboard or creating passwords.""

Therefore, the single internet address (Ɛntɛrinɛti ladɛrɛsi kelen) is the feature that directly addresses the needs of students with these types of challenges.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de tun tɛ Krushchev ka jaabi la ka ɲɛsin baarakɛlaw ka mankanw ma?","The passage states that Khrushchev ""reluctantly yielded some demands and agreed to the appointment of Wadyslaw Gomulka as the new Prime Minister."" It also mentions he ""deployed troops to restore order.""

Let's break down the options:

*   **A: Ka minisiri ɲɛmɔgɔ kura dɔ sigi (Appointing a new prime minister):** The passage explicitly says Khrushchev agreed to this.
*   **B: Ka mugucimɔbiliw bila ka ta basigilanati (Deploying troops to restore order):** The passage explicitly says Khrushchev did this.
*   **C: Ka dɔfara sara jiginni kan (Lowering wage cuts):** The passage says the workers were protesting low wages and wage cuts. Since Khrushchev reluctantly yielded some demands, we can infer that he reduced the wage cuts.
*   **D: Sɔrɔsira ɲinini dɔw lakodɔnni (Acknowledging some demands):** The passage explicitly says Kruschev ""reluctantly yielded some demands"".

Based on the passage, Khrushchev addressed the wage cuts to some extent.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**.
"
Ninnu jumɛn de tun te makanw kun ye Polɔɲi?,"The correct answer is **D: Wladyslaw Gomulka sigili** (Wladyslaw Gomulka's appointment).

Here's why:

The passage states the workers protested **balokodɛsɛ** (poor working conditions) and **sara jiginni** (wage cuts), and ultimately **Kominizimu** (Communism). Gomulka's appointment was a *result* of the protests, not something they were protesting *against*. They were protesting conditions *under* the Communist system, which led to Gomulka's appointment as a concession."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de ma fɛn kɛ USSR ni USA ka jɛɲɔgɔnya la?","The correct answer is **B: Hakilinaw Alimaɲi kan** (Opinions on Germany).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that during World War II, the USSR and USA were allies against Germany. Therefore, their shared stance against Germany *united* them, not divided them.
*   After the war ended, ideological differences, power struggles, and competition for influence led to the Cold War. The other options (taabolo danfara, danfara ɲini baaraw, sisitɛmuw kukan kɛlɛw) are all potential reasons that caused the split and the beginning of the cold war.
"
Ninnu jumɛn de tɛ fasa cikanw cili ka ta farikolola kun ɲɛfɔ ka ɲɛ?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka tangali kɛ ka bɔ bagabaliw ma minnu bɛ se ka kɛ farikolola**.

Here's why:

*   **P describes vaccines (""fasajuru sira b'a cogoya mara nin fasa cikanw cilile ka ta farikolola"")** as a way to train the body to fight off diseases (""farikolo lakana kabɔ kɔlɔlɔ dɔ ma"").

Let's break down why the other options are related to the function of vaccines:

*   **A: Ka joli bolili sumaya** (Reduce bleeding) - Not what vaccines do
*   **B: Ka joli bolili ɲɛnabɔ** (Promote bleeding) - Not what vaccines do
*   **C: K’a cogoya mara** (Manage how it acts/behaves) - vaccines will help the body manage the infection if exposed to one.
*   **D: Ka tangali kɛ ka bɔ bagabaliw ma minnu bɛ se ka kɛ farikolola** (Protect against germs that can cause infection) - this is the main purpose of vaccines.

**Therefore, the statement that *does not* accurately describe a function of vaccines is D.**"
Mun de bɛ se ka sɔrɔ The Giza Plateau la?,"The correct answer is **D: PiramidiBa in**.

While options A and B are also correct, option D is the most direct and encompassing answer as the entire passage revolves around the Great Pyramid and its significance on the Giza Plateau. Option C is incorrect as only one of the seven wonders stands, not all of them.
"
Piramidi Ba kun tun ye mun ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka tasibilakɛ Firawuna dɔ ye** (To be a tomb for a Pharaoh).

The passage explicitly states: ""Piramidiba ye piramidibelebelew dɔ ye minnu tun jɔra ka tasibila kɛ ka ɲɛsin Farawuna su ma"" (The Great Pyramid is one of the massive pyramids that were built as tombs for Pharaohs). The last sentence also mentions it was built as a tomb for Pharaoh Khufu.
"
Jɔnni y’an ka tasumadonwale dɔnni sabu ye min ye tasumadonwale sɔnnikɛyɔrɔ tiɲɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Strabo**.

The passage states: ""Girɛsi kokɔrɔwɲɛɲinibaga Strabo y'a tɔgɔ sɛbɛn, i n'a fɔ anw y'a dɔn cogo minna bi."" This directly indicates that Strabo is the reason we know about Herostratus.
"
Kumasen jumɛn ye tiɲɛ ye ka ɲɛsin Artemis sɔnnikɛyɔrɔ jɔli ma kokura?,"The correct answer is **B: A jɔra kokura Zulu Kara Nani ka mara kɔfɛ** (It was rebuilt after the reign of Zulu Kara Nani).

Here's why:

* The passage states that Zulu Kara Nani tried to fund the rebuilding but was ultimately unsuccessful during his reign.
* It further states that the temple was rebuilt in 323 AD, which is *after* Zulu Kara Nani's death.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, waati fɔlɔfɔlɔ jumɛn de la danfɛn dɔ tamana sen fila kan?","The correct answer is **A: Nin y’a san miliyɔn wolonwula ye**.

The passage states: ""ali na sɔrɔ Sahelanthropus kun tamara lala a sen fila kan inafɔ miliyɔn wɔlɔnwula tɛmɛni damina la."" This translates to ""and it is found that Sahelanthropus already walked on two feet about seven million years ago.""
"
Nin danfɛn jumɛnw de tun bɛ tama u sen fila kan tuma bɛɛ?,"Based on the text, the correct answer is **A: Sahelanthropus**.

The passage states: ""ali na sɔrɔ Sahelanthropus kun tamara lala a sen fila kan inafɔ miliyɔn wɔlɔnwula tɛmɛni damina la"" which translates to ""until Sahelanthropus started walking on its two legs about seven million years ago"".
"
Alimaɲi kɛlɛkɛ bato kulu tun bɛ ka mun de waleya Diɲɛ Kɛlɛba Filannan waati la?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka Biritaɲi bali mɔgɔw ni feerefɛnw sɔrɔli la** (To prevent Britain from receiving people and supplies).

The passage states that the German U-boat fleet aimed to stop ships. The US was trying to mobilize people and war material across the Atlantic to help Great Britain. The Germans were trying to stop this effort. This means they were trying to prevent Britain from getting supplies and people.
"
"Ka da kunnafoni dilen kan tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ, jɔn ye se ba sɔrɔ kɔgɔji kɛlɛ la Atlantic Woroduguyanfan Kanpaɲi na?","The correct answer is **A: Biritanikiw ni Amerikikaw**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the American objective was to mobilize resources across the Atlantic to help Great Britain. This implies they were working together.
*   It also describes the German U-boats attempting to stop boat traffic, meaning the British and Americans were actively trying to *move* goods and people. Success in coastal operations will mean that goods will pass.

Therefore, the British and Americans were working together to achieve their goals in the North Atlantic campaign, while the Germans were trying to disrupt them."
Mun de tun tɛ yen tuma min na Asariyaniw ye so kɔ sanfɛ kɛlɛ daminɛ?,"The text states: ""kɛrɛkɛ tun ma dilan fɔlɔ, o la Asariyaniw tun be kɛlɛ kɛ k'u to uka so kɔ jalanw kan."" This means that chariots (kɛrɛkɛw) were not invented yet when the Assyrians started fighting on horseback.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Kɛrɛkɛw**
"
"Kɛlɛ minnu tun bɛ kɛ so kɔkan, olu bɛ cogodi?","The correct answer is **C: So kɔkan**

The passage directly states that Assyrians fought battles while on horses (""Asariyaniw tun be kɛlɛ kɛ k'u to uka so kɔ jalanw kan""). Therefore, battles fought on horseback are described as ""so kɔkan"".
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, i tɛ Babyloneka ka sɔrɔ yɔrɔ jumɛn na?","The passage says: ""Mɔgɔw kun bɛ sarakaw bɔ jow ye ani sɔnnikɛla kun b'a ɲini ka jow ka laɲini batoni sarakaw ni ɲɛnagɛw ye."" which translates to ""People bring sacrifices to the gods and the worshippers seek to follow the desires of the gods through offerings and prayers."" It also states: ""Bɛdaba kun bɛ sɔnnikɛso bɛ la ani soɲɛkɔnɔna dɔ sɔnnikɛla durɔn kun bɛ don min kɔnɔ."" which translates to ""Priests were at the temple, and only worshippers could enter a certain inner chamber."".

Based on this, options A, C, and D are all consistent with the passage.

Option B, ""Ka taa ɲɛnajɛ kɛ sɔnniyɔrɔ fɔlɔ dɔ la"" (To go entertain oneself at a primary place of worship) is **NOT** mentioned.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**.
"
Nin fɛn jumɛn kelen tun dabɔlen do sɔnnikɛlaw kama kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnenya la?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Ziggurats**.

Here's why:

*   The text specifically mentions ""sojan jɔnjɔnw munuw bɛ i ko pyramides, ni u tɔgɔ ye Ziggurats, kun dilanna i n'a fɔ sɔnnikɛyɔrɔ fan dɔ"" which translates to ""massive structures that resemble pyramids, called Ziggurats, were built as part of the place of worship"". This indicates that Ziggurats served as a specific place for worship.
"
Waati jumɛn Masa Tutankhamun ye tɔgɔtigiya sɔrɔ?,"The correct answer is **C: A kaburu yeli kɔfɛ**.

The passage explicitly states: ""A kaburu yeli san 1922 y'a kɛ tɔgɔtigi ye."" (The discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous).
"
Mun tun ye Tutankhamun kɛ Izipiti Masa dɔnnen ba dɔ ye?,"The correct answer is **A: A kaburu min tun tora a cogo la o kɛli** (The discovery of his tomb which remained intact).

The passage states that Tutankhamun was not considered an important king during his time, but the discovery of his intact tomb in 1922 made him famous. The other options are incorrect based on the information in the passage:

*   **B:** The passage says he *wasn't* regarded highly by other kings.
*   **C:** The passage says his tomb *wasn't* robbed.
*   **D:** The passage says he wasn't considered a great leader, diminishing his importance at the time.

Therefore, **A** is the only answer that directly reflects the reason for Tutankhamun's fame as stated in the passage.
"
Gɛrɛki poyi bɔla Homer tun tese ka mun kɛ?,"The passage states that Homer composed the Iliad and the Odyssey, which are poems. Therefore, Homer's primary activity was writing. Of the options provided, the best answer is:

* **D: Ka kuma** (To speak) - Since poetry is a form of spoken or written word, this is the closest activity related to his job as a Greek Poet.

The other options don't directly relate to poetry composition:

* **A: Ka mɛli kɛ** (To grind)
* **B: Ka yeli kɛ** (To build)
* **C: Ka taama** (To walk)
"
Gɛrɛki tɔgɔtigi jumɛn dɔnna fɛn wɛrɛ sababu la min tɛ sɛbɛni baara ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagoras**.

The passage states that Pythagoras is known for his mathematical theorem, not for writing. The other options are all playwrights or poets.
"
Izirayɛli denbayaw tun b’u ka waati fanba bɛɛ kɛ yɔrɔ jumɛn?,"The correct answer is **A: Kɛnɛma fiɲɛ na** (In the open air).

The passage states: ""Izirayɛli kaw ka diyɛnlatigɛ fanba bɛɛ tun be kɛ kɛnɛma fiyɛn na."" This translates to ""Most of the Israelites' leisure activities were done in the open air.""
"
Mun nafa tun man bon kosɛbɛ Izirayɛli denbayaw bolo?,"The correct answer is **C: U ka so (Their houses)**.

The passage states ""Futeni waati in na Azi kɔrɔnseleke camancɛyɔrɔ la, so nafa tun man bɔn"" which directly translates to ""At that time in parts of Southwest Asia, houses were not very valuable.""
"
Nin fɛnw jumɛn kelen ɲɛfɔlen tɛ ka kɛ Sikandinavi jamanaw danfara ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Dukukolo (Geography/Territory)**.

The passage explicitly mentions differences in:

*   **A: Taariku (History)**
*   **C: Laadaw (Customs/Traditions)**
*   **D: Mɔgɔw (People)** (including kings/leaders)

The passage does not mention any differences in geography as a distinguishing factor between Scandinavian countries. Therefore, dukukolo (geography/territory) is the correct answer."
Jɔn fɔlɔ tun sigira Greenland?,"The correct answer is **A: Eskimo siyaw**.

The passage states: ""Nka aka yeli in kɛrɛfɛ, Eskimo kabilaw tun sigilen be yen o waati in na kaban"" which translates to ""But before his arrival, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.""
"
Kulu jumɛn tun b’a kanu ka surɔfana dun kasɔrɔ u m’u sigi sigilanw kan?,"Based on the text, the passage states: ""...waritigiw kun bɛ dumunidumanw dun ɲɔkɔn fɛ ni la to k'u waso u ka fanna u dumuni kɛ tɔ."" This indicates that wealthy people would recline while eating. The passage does not explicitly specify the gender, but we are told: ""...fantanw ni musow kun bɛ dumuni kɛra u sigilen sikilanw kan"" which implies that poor people and women were eating sitting.

Therefore, to answer the question ""Which group enjoyed saffron while not sitting on chairs?"" we need to infer who would be reclining (not sitting) and enjoying luxurious foods (saffron).

*   The text states the wealthy reclined while eating fine foods.
*   Since the passage does not state that this trait was only for men, we can assume it was practiced by both genders.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

**C: Romains cɛwaaritigiw**

While it's possible wealthy women *also* reclined, the passage doesn't offer enough evidence to definitively say it was *only* them (A). Since the passage stated ""fantanw ni musow kun bɛ dumuni kɛra u sigilen sikilanw kan"", we can disregard both B and D because they are both poor."
Nin fɛn jumɛnw kelen tɛ Romain kɔrɔw ka ɲɛnagɛdumuni ye?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: Kulokulo wɔrɔtilen tasaɲɛkelen (Frozen melon ice cream).**

The passage explicitly states: ""...ani Romainskɔrɔw fɛnɛ kun tɛ kulokulo nɛnɛ (the Romans didn't know frozen melon)."" The other options are either mentioned as part of their diet or practices (even if practices differed among classes).

This translates to ""Small cultures sometimes disappear without leaving a lasting impact on history and cannot be considered as civilization itself.""

Therefore, the answer is B: Seko ni dɔnko fitini (Small cultures).
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni nin tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de bɛ kɔn jamana ɲɛ?","The passage states: ""Dugu-jamanaw ye jamana ɲɛbilaw ye."" This means ""City-states are the precursors to nations.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Dugu-jamana dɔ** (A city-state)

Kuma jumɛn kelen fɔlen be Drukgyal Dzong kan n’o tɛ tiɲɛ ye?,"Let's analyze each statement based on the given paragraph:

*   **A: A tun jɔra walasa ka hakililajigin kɛ ka kɛ ɲɛsin a ka se ma Tibɛti-Mɔngɔlikaw ka kɛlɛcɛw kan** - The paragraph states that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built it to commemorate his victory over the Tibetan-Mongol forces, so this is true.
*   **B: A be Bhutan kɔnɔ** - The passage states that it is located in the Paro Valley (Phondey town), which is located in Bhutan, so this is true.
*   **C: Tasuma dɔ ye jasɛbɛnfuraw canma jeni** - The passage states that a fire in 1951 destroyed much of Drukgyal Dzong's valuable contents, so this is true.
*   **D: A jɔra Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel fɛ** - The paragraph states that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the Dzong, so this is true.

Since all the options are true, there might be a mistake in the question or the passage. If the question asks ""Which of the following statements is *not* mentioned in the text"", then the correct answer will be that all options are mentioned in the passage.

However, based on the given options and the text, there is no false statement. I suspect that the question should be ""Which of the following statements is NOT true?""

Since all options are true according to the passage, I can't choose an answer.
"
Nin kuma jumɛn kelen bɛ tasuma kɔlɔlɔ ɲɛfɔ Drukgyal Dzong yɔrɔ la?,"The correct answer is **A: Jasɛbɛnfura kelen min tora o tun ye Zhabsdrung Ngawang Namgyal ja ye**.

The text states: ""San 1951, tasuma dɔ mɛnɛni kɛra sababu ye Drukgyal Dzong jasɛbɛnfura damadama dɔrɔn tora, i n'a fɔ Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal ja."" This translates to: ""In 1951, a fire broke out and as a result, only a few artifacts of Drukgyal Dzong remained, such as the Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal image.""

Here's why:

*   **P** states ""Kɛmɛsi 18na labanw na Viyetinamukaw fɛnɛ ye Kanbɔji minɛ"" which means ""Towards the end of the 18th century, the Vietnamese effectively seized Cambodia."" This aligns with option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Viyetinamukaw ka ye Phnom Phen filenkolonci ka dakolonci**: The paragraph states that the Tayalndikaw seized Phnom Phen, not the Viyetinamukaw
*   **B: Kanbɔji ye Tayilandi minɛ san 1772**: **P** states ""san 1772 u ye Phnom Phen"" so it was Thailand who seized Phnom Phen, not Cambodia.
*   **D: Tayilandikaw ye Phnom Phen filenkolonci ka dakakolonci**: The paragraph states that the Tayalndikaw seized Phnom Phen, not filenkolonci.

Therefore, only option C is directly supported and factually correct based on the provided text."

Here's why:

*   **P** states that ""Tayilandikaw ye Kanbɔji minɛ siɲɛ caman kɛmɛsi 18na la"" (The Thais occupied Cambodia many times in the 18th century).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Viyetinamukaw ye Kanbɔji minɛ siɲɛ canma** (The Vietnamese occupied Cambodia many times) - While true that the Vietnamese occupied Cambodia later in the 18th century, the original passage emphasizes the Thai occupations. So, option D is more accurate.
*   **B: Tayilandikaw ani Viyetinamukaw ye Kanbɔji minɛ san 1772** (The Thais and Vietnamese occupied Cambodia in 1772) - The passage says the Thais occupied Phnom Phen in 1772, but there is no mention of Vietnamese.
*   **C: Viyetinamukaw ka ye Phnom Phen filenkolonci ka dakolonci** (The Vietnamese are the capital of Phnom Phen) - This doesn't make sense grammatically, and it is not stated in passage P.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate based on the information provided in passage P."
Peyiba cakɛda East India Company ma nin fɛnw jumɛn kelen kɛ k’u to Tayiwan kɔnɔ?,"The correct answer is **A, B, and C**. Here's why:

*   **A: Ka jujɔn dɔ sigi gun worodugutilebin-yanfa na** - The text explicitly states: ""1624 san, Peyiba cakɛda East India Company ye jujɔn dɔ sigi Tayiwani worodugutilebinyanfan na...""

*   **B: Ka sumakisɛlakika bayɛlɛmali labaara** - The text says: ""...ka bayɛlɛmani dɔ judon ka ɲɛsin sumakisɛlakika-labaaraliw ma..."" (to promote sugarcane cultivation).

*   **C: Ka Sini baarakɛlaw ta forow kɔnɔ** - The text states: ""...ani ka Sini baarakɛraw ta k'a malo ni sukarofoorow labaara."" (and to hire Chinese laborers to work the sugarcane fields).

*   **D: Ka jɛn ka Tayiwani mara di Qing fangabolokɛlɛcɛw ma** - This is incorrect. The Dutch East India Company *didn't* agree to give Taiwan to the Qing dynasty. They were eventually ousted by them. The agreement mentioned in the passage (Shimonoseki) was made by the Qing dynasty with Japan much later, after the Dutch were long gone.

Therefore, the Dutch East India Company did A, B, and C."
Shimoneski Bɛnka ye mun sigi senka?,"The correct answer is **D: Zapɔn ka marabolili Tayiwani kan** (Japan's colonization of Taiwan).

The passage states that after losing the First Sino-Japanese War, the Qing dynasty ceded Taiwan to Japan through the Treaty of Shimonoseki. This effectively began Japan's colonial rule over Taiwan.
"
Danifɛnw bayɛlɛman kundama be suman cogo di?,"Based on the passage provided, the correct answer is **C: Hydrogene ions kundama nin be bayɛlɛma kɔnɔ.**

The passage explicitly states: ""PH kundaman jirara ni Hydrogene hakɛ ye (H PH la)"" which translates to ""The pH scale is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen (H in pH).""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Asidi walima basiki ŋakaminlen be bayɛlɛma la cogo min (How acidic or alkaline something is):** While pH *indicates* acidity or alkalinity, the question asks how the pH *itself* is quantified.
*   **B: Protons joli bɛ bayɛlɛma kɔnɔ (How many protons are in the substance):** While related to hydrogen ions (which *are* protons), it's the *concentration* of hydrogen ions that defines pH, not just the total number.
*   **D: Electrons kundama joli be bayɛlɛma kɔnɔ (How many electrons are in the substance):** The passage specifically mentions that hydrogen ions are protons that have *lost* their electron. Therefore, electrons are not directly used to quantify the PH.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**.
"
Mun tun bɔra Hydrogene ions la?,"The correct answer is **A: Protons**.

The text says ""Hydrogene ions ye protons ye munu ka electrons samanra ka bɔ"" which translates to ""Hydrogen ions are protons that have had electrons removed.""
"
Kumasen jumɛn tɛ warakuluw ɲɛfɔ kaɲɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: U kɛwalew ni wulukuluw ta ye kelen ye** (Their actions are similar to those of wolf packs).

The passage explicitly states that waranikulubaw (waraba groups/packs) act like bakɔlɔwulukulu walima wulukulu (hyena packs or wolf packs), indicating a similarity in their behavior and social structure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Cɛ ni muso ka gɛrɛ ɲɔgɔnna tɛ te** (Men and women are not close to each other): The text says that females bond strongly as sisters and mother-daughters, contradicting this statement.
*   **C: Cɛ ni muso bɛɛ ka surun ɲɔgɔn na** (Men and women are all close to each other): The passage focuses on the female bonds. The relationship between males and females is not described, making this option too broad.
*   **D: U bi fakali kɛ ani hadamadenya** (They are being killed and treated humanely): The text mentions that they ""b'u balo faka"" (they feed themselves by killing), implying hunting, not necessarily being killed *and* treated humanely. Besides, this choice does not define the warakuluw as the question asks, but talks of being killed.

Therefore, option A best and most accurately reflects the information provided in the passage about how to define ""warakuluw""."
Ninnu kumasen jumɛn tɛ waraw kɛwale ɲɛfɔ ka ɲɛ?,"Based on the passage provided, the correct answer is **D: U kɛwalew bɔli kungo waraw tɔw fɛ.**

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions: ""bankan munuw dabaliban bɔlen do warabaw fɛ (nka jakumakunba tɔw kɔ tɛ)"" which means: ""their defensive behavior differs from that of other jackals (but not from the big jackals)"". This implies that their actions are different from other similar wild dogs.

The other options are not supported by the provided text:

*   **A: U ka jɛɲɔgɔnya ka bon kosɛbɛ (Their relationship is very important)** is not explicitly mentioned in the text.
*   **B: U kɛwale bɛ se ka suma ni bakɔlɔwulu ta ye (Their actions can be compared to those of baboons)** This is partially correct, as the passage says ""waranikulubaw bɛ kow kɛ i n'a fɔ bakɔlɔwulukulu walima wulukulu"", which can be translated to “The jackals act like baboons or wolf packs"".
*   **C: A cɛman n’a musoman bɛɛ bɛ fagali kɛ kosɛbɛ ka ɲɛsin fɛn minɛtaw man (Both males and females are very active in hunting).** The passage does mention that ""u b'u balo faka"" which means, “they feed themselves by hunting” however, it does not specify the gender doing the hunting.

Therefore, option D best reflects a specific point made in the text."

*   **P** also states that *Waranifitiniw* eat *fɛn misɛniw, bagan misɛniw, basaw, ani kɔnɔw*.
*   The question **Q** asks what kind of waraw (waraniw) eat *zɔzanw*.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **C: Waranimankanniw**"

This translates to: ""...smaller ants (including ɲiminawaraw) which eat a large variety of small foods such as small things, small animals, worms, and birds.""

The question asks which of the listed options the *warafitiniw* are prone to eating.

The passage explicitly states they eat ""bagan misɛniw"" (small animals). Therefore, the correct answer is A.
"
Ninnu jumɛn tɛ jakumawara ka fɛlɛli fɛɛrɛ kɔnɔ?,"The correct answer is **D: Dumunimisɛnw dɔrɔn dunni**.

Here's why:

*   **A: K'a yɛrɛ doko u kɛrɛfɛlaw la:** The passage mentions ""jakumawaraw b'u ka sogo yala ka to k'a yɛrɛ doko u kɛrɛfɛlaw la ka sɔrɔ k'i pan a ka sogo nɔfɛ."" This means they camouflage themselves to approach prey.
*   **B: Sokow kasa nɔndoli:** The passage mentions ""ɲininikɛlaw hakilila jakumawaraw bɛ sokowkasa nɔndo ni k'u yɔrɔ ɲini k'u dun."" This means they use their sense of smell to find prey.
*   **C: Sokow dɛndɛli sufɛ:** The passage mentions ""U bɛ yeli kɛ dibi la ni suɲɛn ye, ni ka taaman dɔnidɔni, fɛnɛ."" This indicates they hunt at night using stealth.
*   **D: Dumunimisɛnw dɔrɔn dunni:** The passage states ""Bakanmisɛnniw dunni kadi jakumawaraw ye. U bɛ warabilenw, saaw, sokomisɛnniw, ani kɔnɔw n'u bɛ se."" This means they eat a variety of things, not *only* insects. They eat insects, rabbits, snakes, and birds when they can.

Therefore, eating *only* insects is not a hunting strategy described in the passage, so the answer is D."
Nin fɛnw jumɛn tɛ jakumawara bugunnatigɛ ɲɛfɔ ka ɲɛ? ,"The correct answer is **C: U ka kasatali ka fɛgɛn** (Their hunting is slow).

Here's why:

*   **A: U bɛ se ka sogow yala sufɛ ka ɲɛ** (They can hunt well at night) - This aligns with the text mentioning they hunt at night with their sense of smell (""U bɛ yeli kɛ dibi la ni suɲɛn ye"").

*   **B: U bɛ taaman dɔni dɔni** (They move slowly) - The text confirms this: ""ni ka taaman dɔnidɔni, fɛnɛ"" (and they move slowly, carefully).

*   **D: A kadi u ye ka baganmisɛnw yala** (They like to hunt small animals) - The passage states that they eat insects, lizards, snakes, and even small birds if possible (""Bakanmisɛnniw dunni kadi jakumawaraw ye. U bɛ warabilenw, saaw, sokomisɛnniw, ani kɔnɔw n'u bɛ se."").

*   **C: U ka kasatali ka fɛgɛn** (Their hunting is slow) - While they *move* slowly and deliberately, the text describes a more patient strategy of staying close to the carcass left by others, and being ready to pounce as they scavenge, it doesn't directly mention how fast they hunt or if they can be characterized as slow, just persistent in finding food left from others. So, C is the least accurate description of their hunting style according to the passage.

Therefore, **C** is the best answer because the text doesn't directly say that their hunting *itself* is slow (but the text does describe them as slow and meticulous trackers, which gives them an advantage in finding food).
"
Nin fɛnw jumɛn tɛ jate jaraminɛjara ka sew dɔ ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka kule**.

The passage states that leopards ""kulekan tɛ bɔ kosɛbɛ i m:a waraba ta"" which means leopards do not roar like tigers. The other options (B: Ka yɛlɛ jirila, C: Ka pan, D: K'a saman) are all mentioned as things leopards do.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, nin fɛnw jumɛn bɛ danfara do jaraminɛjaraw ni warabaw cɛ?","The correct answer is **B: U kulekan**.

The passage states ""jaraminɛjara kulekan tɛ bɔ kosɛbɛ i m:a waraba ta..."", which means the roar (kulekan) of a leopard is not as strong as that of a tiger. The passage also describes the other abilities but doesn't offer comparison to tigers:
*   The passage does not say that the **""nɔnni se"" (ability to hunt)** is different between jaraminɛjaraw (leopards) and warabaw (tigers).
*   The passage does not say that the **""ka panni paara hakɛ"" (amount of clawing)** is different between jaraminɛjaraw (leopards) and warabaw (tigers).
*   The passage does not say that the **""ka samani fanga"" (strength to attack)** is different between jaraminɛjaraw (leopards) and warabaw (tigers)."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Robert Hooke ye baara jumɛn kɛ ka kɔn balofɛnw kalanbaw dɔw ɲɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Fan naaniw lajɛ**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Robert Hooken balofɛnw kalanba dɔ kabɔ Angiletɛri, ye fan naaniw ye jirifara kɔnɔna jila nin mikorɔsikɔpu ye."" This translates to: ""Robert Hooke, a great biologist from England, saw cells (fan naaniw) inside cork using a microscope.""

While Hooke did use a microscope (B), and did see dead cells (A), the passage explicitly highlights his observation of the cells/compartments (fan naaniw). Option D is also related, but option C more closely matches the information in the text.
"
“Farikolobɔn” daɲɛ bɔra mina o kɔrɔ ye mun ye?,"Based on the passage:

The passage states: ""Farikolobɔn bɔra Latin daɲɛla calla min kɔrɔ ye ko bɔn."" This translates to ""Farikolobɔn comes from the Latin word cella which means bɔn."" The passage then identifies bɔn as meaning: ""Nin ye fɛnw lajɛ nin mirikorɔsikɔpu ye, i bena ye ko dilaneno ni fan naaniw ye walima korimaniw"" which translates to ""This is what you see under the microscope, and is made of four parts or compartments.""

Therefore, the closest meaning given the context is A: Fan naanifitiniw, which means ""Small compartments"".
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛ sira in ye, baganw caman bɛ se ka mun ni mun kɛ ?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Pani**.

The passage states ""Bagan be sɔrɔ dugukolo fan bɛ fɛ. U be dugukolo sen, ko kɔkɔla, ani ka **pan** sankolola."" This translates to: ""Animals are found everywhere on Earth. They walk on land, swim in water, and **fly** in the sky.""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun fɛn tɛ bagan dɔw la?","The correct answer is **C: Nsɛmɛw**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Nzɛbɛn be bagan dɔrɔnw ne la (alina sɔrɔ baganw bɛtɛ; mediyisi, misalila, nzɛbɛn t'ula)."" This directly translates to ""Insects are *only* in some animals (not all animals; for example, insects are not birds)."" This indicates that insects (Nzɛbɛn) are NOT a universal characteristic of ALL animals.
* **A: Farikolobɔn (Respiration):** The passage states ""Baganw dilan neno nin farikolobɔnda camaw ye."" This translates to ""Animals use lungs for respiration."" Hence, animals possess respiration.
* **B: Dumuni yɛlɛmali se (Metabolism):** The passage states ""U be fɛwn dɔn ani ku yɛlɛma u kɔnɔ."" This translates to ""They take in air and transform food inside them."" This implies animals have the ability to digest or transform food.
* **D: Dumuni se (Food):** The passage implicitly suggests animals need food.

Therefore, the passage indicates that insects are NOT a universal characteristic of ALL animals and thus the answer must be that some animals DO NOT possess insects (Nsɛmɛw)."
Mun bɛ falenfɛnw dɛmɛ photosynthese baara kɛli la?,"The correct answer is **D: Tile (Sun)**.

The passage states: ""falenfɛnw bɛ u dumuni tile fɛ photosynthese fɛ"" which translates to ""plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis"".
"

Here's why:

The passage states: ""falenfɛnw bɛ oxygene dilan mɔgɔw bɛ munuw saman, ani u bɛ dioxyde de carbone ta mɔgɔw bɛ munuw bila ka bɔ"". This directly translates to ""plants produce oxygen and humans breathe it in, and they take carbon dioxide that humans breathe out.""

Ninnu kumasen jumɛn tɛ siyakurabɔ baara bugunnatigɛ ɲɛfɔ ka ɲɛn? ,"The best answer is **C: A bɛ kuma fɛnɲɛnɛma kuraw dɔ dilani kan (It talks about the creation of new species)**.

Here's why:

* **The definition of *siyakurabɔ* (speciation) focuses on how a small group becomes distinct enough from the original population that they are considered a new species.** The text explicitly states that eventually, the two groups become so different they can no longer be considered the same species. This directly relates to the creation of new species.

Let's analyze why the other options are not as accurate:

* **A: Ale bɛ kɛ waati min jama kulu kura dɛsɛra ka deli yɔrɔ kura la (It happens when a new group of population fails to adapt to a new place):**  While adaptation to a new environment is a *driving force* behind speciation, *failure* to adapt doesn't define the process.  Speciation happens because of adaptation, not necessarily because of failure.
* **B: Ale ye fɛn ye min jɔyɔrɔ ka bon ɲɛlɛmanin baara la (It is something that has a big role in the evolution process):** While the text states it is important in evolution, this is a result of speciation, so it does not describe what speciation process is.
* **D: A kɛli tɛ se ka bali (Its doing can't be stopped):** While the text says it is inevitable (tɛ se ka bali), this simply states a characteristic of the speciation process and not the process itself.

Therefore, C best captures the core meaning of speciation as described in the text: the creation of new species.

The passage states: ""U ka se ka pan b'u dɛmɛ ka tila u juguw la nɔgɔyala ani ka dumuni sɔrɔ ani tɔɲɔngɔnw teliyala kosɛbɛ."" This directly translates to: ""Their ability to fly helps them escape their enemies easily, find food, and find mates quickly."" Therefore, the ability to fly (which is linked to wing flapping) contributes to the speed of their flight.

Ninnu jumɛn kelen ma fɔ tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ n’o be dankari kɛ fɛnɲɛnɛmani dɔ panni fanga la?,"The correct answer is **A: Bange**.

Here's why:

*   **P:** The passage discusses the benefits of being able to curl up for insects: avoiding predators, finding food, and finding mates more easily. It also mentions that many insects can curl up because their bodies are segmented.
*   **Q:** The question asks which of the following is NOT mentioned in the passage regarding the ability of insects to curl up.

The passage doesn't mention ""Bange"" (Origin, Family, or Birth) or where an insect is from as a factor related to its ability to curl up. The passage focuses on *segmentation*, which directly relates to the physical ability to curl."

Here's why:

*   **P** states that birds have wings, lay eggs, can fly, and walk on two legs like a T-Rex.
*   Options A, B and C are all similarities described in the passage.
*   Thus, the only thing that the options lists that the two groups did not share is sennɔ (claws)."

    *   Birds lay eggs, just like dinosaurs.
    *   Birds waddle and walk on two legs, just like the T-Rex.

*   **P does not mention small toes in relation to dinosaurs**.

Therefore, small toes are NOT a shared characteristic that the passage emphasizes between birds and dinosaurs. All other answer options (A, B, C) are mentioned within the passage."

This translates to something like ""this plant is made up of slender stems, tasty roots, and thorny leaves."" And the passage further says, ""triceratopes kun bɛ se k'a dakalaba kɛ ka buluw tikɛ sani a ka yiriju dun.""

Nɛzisanfɛbolikɛ (Sailing) is the only water sport option provided, meaning it is the only water sport from the list that the Italians participate in."
"Ka da kunnafoni dilen kan tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ, nin farikoloɲɛnɛjɛ jumɛn kelen ye Diyɛn Ntolantan jɔjɔn ta Itali?","The answer is **A: Ntolantan**.

The passage explicitly states that Italy won the FIFA World Cup (Diyɛn Ntolantan Jɔnjɔn) in 2006. ""Ntolantan"" means football (soccer).
"
Ko jumɛn kɔfɛ Luxembourg fan dɔw kɛra Bɛlizigi fan dɔ ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Bɛlizikikaw ka Yɛlɛmali**.

The passage states that ""Bɛliziki bi-sigiyɔrɔw tun yed Luxembourg fan dɔ ye fɔlɔ nka u kɛra Bɛliziki ta ye Bɛlizikikaw ka yɛlɛma kɔfɛ san 1830 kɔnɔ"" (Present-day Belgium used to be part of Luxembourg, but they became part of Belgium after the Belgian Revolution in 1830).
"
Nin fɛn kelen jumɛn ye dankari Luxembourg ka fasabaliya la?,"The correct answer is **A: Alimanw ka minɛli** (German occupation).

The passage explicitly states that Luxembourg was occupied by Germany during both World War I and World War II, which directly interfered with its neutrality. The other options are not related to violations of Luxembourg's neutrality.
"
Tiriki dugukolo kilomɛtiri kare joli bɛ Ɛrɔpu kɔnɔ?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: 9174**.

The passage states that the total area of Turkey is 783,562 square kilometers, with 755,688 square kilometers in Asia.  The difference between these two values (783,562 - 755,688) gives us the area of Turkey located in Europe, which is 9174 square kilometers.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Tiriki janya be taa nɔngɔn ɲɛ joli ɲɔgɔnw la?","The passage states: ""Tiriki dugukolo bɛ tɛmɛ kilomɛtɛrɛ 1.600 (nɔngɔn ɲɛ 1.000) kan janyan na ani kilomɛtɛrɛ 800 (nɔngɔn ɲɛ 500) kan boɲan na"".

The question asks about the extent of Turkey's *janya*, or length, in miles.  The passage clearly indicates that janya is 1000 miles.

Therefore, the answer is D.
"
Latin kan be labaara ka mun kɛ Vatican dugu kɔnɔ?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Kuma lasetaw**

The passage states: ""Vatican dugu be italiyɛn kan labaara u ka sariyasun kɔnɔ ani u ka kuma lasetaw la."" (Vatican City uses Italian in its constitution and communications.)
"
"Vatican dugu kɔnɔ, Italiyɛn kan be labaara ka mun kɛ?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A, B, and C**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Italiyɛɛn ye fɛnɛ dɔngɔndo kan ye min be itilize mɔgɔ camaw fɛ minunw be baara kɛ jamana fɛ tumamina nin latin be itilize waatidɔw la **dinɛ ɲɛjɛw la**. Vatican dugu be italiyɛn kan labaara u ka **sariyasun** kɔnɔ ani u ka **kuma lasetaw** la.""
"
"Ka kɛnɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn kelen be nafa sɔrɔ dɔngili ɲagamili la ɔridinatɛri ɲuman la?","The correct answer is **A: Dɔngili**.

The passage specifically states that musicians use computers to work with and mix songs. While the passage mentions other uses of computers (photos, videos, animation), only music/songs are directly related to mixing.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsiran in ye, nɔkɔsamanɲɛkɛn tun be yɔrɔ sow fanbaw kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **C: Santoroni**.

The passage states that ""Jinɔkɔ sariŋa sistɛmun tɔw yera sow kɔnɔ Crete Minoan duguw kɔnɔ ani Santorini Grece kɔnɔ."" This means sewage systems were seen in homes in Santorini, Greece.
"
Ninnu yɔrɔ jumɛnw kelen na jinɔkɔ sariŋa sistɛmu sɔrɔ la ?,"The correct answer is **B: Santorini**.

The passage states: ""Jinɔkɔ sariŋa sistɛmun tɔw yera sow kɔnɔ Crete Minoan duguw kɔnɔ ani Santorini Grece kɔnɔ.""
"
Ninnu jumɛnw kelen bɛ sanbɛlɛbolikɛla bila ka fara?,"The correct answer is **A: Tikɛyɔrɔ fitini min bɛ sanbɛlɛbolinɛgɛ kɔfɛla lan.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...k'a sabu kɛ nɛgɛ kɔfɛla tikɛlen do dɔni, ka nɛgɛ jɛnkɛnlen to fan dɔ fɛ walima dɔ wɛrɛ fɛ, dakun min dalen do sanbɛlɛ kan bɛ kuru fɛnɛ. o bɛ sanbɛlɛbolikɛla bila ka fara.""

This translates to: ""...because of a small indentation on the back of the metal, leaving the metal inclined to one side or the other, the part attached to the foot becomes unstable. This causes the golfer to lean.""

Therefore, the *small indentation on the back of the metal* (Tikɛyɔrɔ fitini min bɛ sanbɛlɛbolinɛgɛ kɔfɛla lan) is the direct cause of the golfer leaning. The other options are incorrect because they don't directly explain the mechanical cause of leaning as described in the text.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn kelen bɛ sisan sanbɛlɛbolinɛgɛ digɛn bugunatigɛ ka ɲɛ?","The correct answer is **B: Kurulen**.

The passage states: ""dakunfila bɛ sisan sanbɛlɛbolinɛgɛ la digankurulen bɛ munu ni ɲɔkɔn cɛ."" This directly translates to ""the pin in the current seesaw has a turning point between them."" The word ""kurulen"" refers to this turning point.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsiran in ye, lafilili juman kelen b’a to kisɛniw bɛ funtɛnikurafarankan labɔ u ye mun be sɔrɔ yeelen fɛ?","The text states: ""...ɲininikɛlaw b'a fɔ o ma """"lafililijagoyalen"""" bawo kisɛniw lajagoyara yeelenjɛlen fɛ, min bɛ photon yeelen fili, ani yeelen ye labɔli suku dɔ ye.""

This translates to: ""...researchers call it """"stimulated emission"""" because the atoms are stimulated by incoming light, which emits a photon of light, and light is a form of emission.""

The question asks: According to the passage, which process allows atoms to release photons after receiving light?

The passage explicitly states that the process is called **""lafililijagoyalen""** (stimulated emission) and that light is a form of **""labɔli suku dɔ ye""** (a type of emission).

Therefore, the best answer is **D: Lafililidiyagoyalen**. While A (Labɔli - Emission) is related, D is the more precise term used to describe the entire process.
"
Mun de be kisɛni bila photon dɔ fili la?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka funtenikurafarankan labɔ**

The passage states: ""Walasa k'u funtenikɔrɔ labɔ, u ka kan ka u funtenikurafaralen de labɔ... u kɛtɔla k'o kɛ u bɛ yeelen fitini dɔ fili min tɔkɔ ye """"photon"""" ye.""  This translates to: ""In order to emit their old energy, they must emit their newly acquired energy... doing so causes them to emit a small light called a ""photon""."" Therefore, emitting newly acquired energy causes the emission of a photon.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de bɛ laban ka yeelenbarani ban baara ma?","The correct answer is **C: Yeelenbarani kɔnɔjurunin jenin** (The burning of the lightbulb filament).

The passage clearly states that ""Lɛri kɛmɛ caman tɛmɛlen baara la yeelenbarani kɔnɔjuruni bɛ se ka jeni ni ka yeelenbarani bali baara ma"" which translates to: ""After hundreds of hours of use, the filament inside the lightbulb can burn out and cause the lightbulb to stop working.""
"
Ninnu jumɛn de be se ka kɛ farati fɛn ye n’i magar’a la kuma min i bɛka yeelenbarani falen?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Yeelenbaraninɛgɛ (Battery acid)**.

The passage explicitly warns that battery acid (""yeelenbaraninɛgɛ"") can severely burn you if you come into contact with it while replacing a car battery.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de bɛ kɛ ni camancɛ dɔ cira?","Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **B: Fagan labilala**

The text states, ""Camancɛ cili ka ta sanfɛ b'o fagan dɔni labila,"" which translates to ""Some components are released and it is a loss of weight."" In this context, **fagan** refers to the weight released or lost.

Therefore, when a component is released, there is a loss of matter, indicating something, in this case **fagan**, is released.
"
Ninnu jumɛn de tɛ yɔrɔjan weleli jira ka ɲɛ min be segin ka jigin Dugukolo kan,"The correct answer is **A: Telesikɔpuw**.

Here's why:

*   **P** describes a process where a satellite takes a signal from Earth and bounces it back.
*   The question **Q** asks which of the listed items is *not* involved in this long-distance communication process that involves returning to Earth.
*   **Satellites** are the core of the described process.
*   **Filikurunw (Rockets)** are used to launch satellites.
*   **Yeelenw (Signals)** are the signals being bounced.
*   **Telesikɔpuw (Telescopes)** are used for observation and are not directly involved in the process of bouncing signals back to Earth."
Ninnu jumɛn de bɛ kɛ telescope bila ka ta sanfɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Filikurunw**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""filikurun belebele bɛ senkan ɲɛjanɲan 100 ta walasa ka satellite walema telescope bila sanfɛ."" This directly says rockets (filikurunw) are used to launch satellites and telescopes into space.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeelenbɔlanw (Telescopes):** Telescopes are what are being launched *using* rockets, not what is used to launch them.
* **C: Dugukolo lahalayaw (Earth's atmosphere):** While the atmosphere is mentioned as a reason to put telescopes in space, it's not the *method* of getting them there.
* **D: Sateliti minnu bɛ senkan ɲɛjanɲan 100 (Satellites with a 100-year lifespan):** The passage mentions that rockets are used to launch telescopes, not satellites with 100-year lifespan."
Mun de k’an ka jate kokɛta kumacama walasa ka waati temɛta jatedɔn?,"The correct answer is **B: Seginkanni (Repetition)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Kokɛta kumacama ye fɛn ye min be kɛ tuguni ani tuguni tumabɛla."" This translates to ""Cyclical events are things that happen again and again repeatedly.""
*   The passage uses cyclical events to measure time: ""I be seka waati tɛmɛli tamasiyɛn nin yɛrɛ ye nin kow kɛ taw kumacama lajɛli ye."" This translates to ""You can use the repetition of these cyclical events as a symbol to measure the passage of time.""
*   Therefore, the reason we use cyclical events to measure time is because of their **repetition**

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Janya (Duration/Length):** While duration is related to time, it's the *repetition* of events that allows us to mark the passage of time.
*   **C: Nɔ (Effect/Consequence):** While events have consequences, it's not the consequence that makes them useful for measuring time.
*   **D: Gɛlɛya (Difficulty):** The difficulty of an event is not related to its use in measuring time."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kokɛta yɔrɔ jumɛn de bɛ ta ka sanga waati la?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Seginkanni (Repetition)**.

The passage states: ""Kokɛta kumacama ye fɛn ye min be kɛ tuguni ani tuguni tumabɛla."" This translates to ""A circular process is something that happens again and again repeatedly.""  The repetition described is what connects the concept of a cyclical process to the understanding of time.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni temɛsira in ye, a jatelen don ko ninnu jumɛn de bɛ se ka kɛ tiɲɛtabaga ye ka ɲɛsin masasigilan ma?","The correct answer is **D: Taali sanfɛkalanso la ka kɔn donni ɲɛ kɛlɛbolo la**

Here's why:

* The passage states that traditionally, someone in Laada la's position (presumably heir to the throne or a high-ranking royal) would have gone to the army after their initial education.
* Charles broke this tradition by going to Cambridge University instead *before* any potential military service. This makes option D the correct answer. The passage doesn't imply anything else, A, B, and C are not tiɲɛtabaga.
"
"Ka da kunnafoni dilen kan temɛsira in kɔnɔ, Charles kɛra mɔgɔ fɔlɔ ye ka mun kɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Kunnawolosɛbɛn dɔ sɔrɔli**.

The passage states that Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to earn a degree. While he also studied Archaeology and attended Trinity College, the passage highlights the degree as the *first* achievement.
"

Tariku waati jumɛn na Alimaɲi ka taabolo nɔba bilala Ɛsitoni jamana na?,"The passage states ""San kɛmɛ sigiyɔrɔma 15na yɔrɔw la,"" which translates to ""In the 15th century"". Therefore, the correct answer is not explicitly present in the options. However, the closest answer to 15th century is **A: San 200 yanfan fɛ**. While the passage mentions the 15th century, the options are too far apart to accurately reflect this. The question is poorly formed given the provided text.
"
Mun de ye nɔ ba bila Ɛsitoni kan na?,"The correct answer is **B: Alimaɲi sigidenw**.

The passage states that the written Estonian language was developed by German missionaries and was based on German, for German settlers.  While all the options are mentioned in the passage, the German settlers are the direct influence on the development of the Estonian language.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mɔgɔ minnu fakan ye Hindi ye olu bɛ falen ka da fɛn jumɛn de kan?","The correct answer is **A: Kan bolofara minnu ka surun Hindi la kosɛbɛ n’olu bɛ ka jate** (Language varieties that are very close to Hindi are counted).

The passage states that the number of native Hindi speakers varies depending on whether or not related languages are included in the count. This directly supports option A.  The text mentions that Hindi and Urdu are very similar and speakers can understand each other. This implies that including Urdu speakers would influence the count of Hindi speakers.
"
Ninnu kumasen jumɛn ye tiɲɛ ye Hindi ni Urdu kanw ka ?,"The correct answer is **B: U sɛbɛnniw tɛ kelen ye**.

The passage states: ""Hindi kan ni Urudu kan daɲɛw ye kelen ye nka u sɛbɛncogo te kelen ye don o don kumaw la"". This directly translates to ""Hindi and Urdu languages share vocabulary, but their writing systems are different in everyday language"". Therefore, option B is the accurate statement.
"
Ninnu jumɛn tɛ tiɲɛ ye Hangeul siginidenw kan?,"Tiɲɛ tɛ min na:

Tɔw bɛɛ tiɲɛ don."
Hunmin Jeongeum siginiden tun labanna ka falen mun na?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The passage states that Hunmin Jeongeum was the original name for the alphabet, which was later known as Hangeul.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Sanskrit ye nɔ bila kan jumɛnw de la?","The correct answer is **D: Ɛndu jamana kanw**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""...Sanskrit kan ka misɛn ani kan nafama do, min kɛra **Ɛndi kaw ka kan kura caman ju ye**, inafɔ Latɛn kɛra Erɔpu kanw ju ye inafɔ Faransi kan ani Ɛsipaɲi kan.""
*   This explicitly says Sanskrit is the base for many **Indian/Hindu** languages.
*   Option A, B, and C are mentioned in the text, but they do not refer to what Sanskrit influenced, but were instead used to compare Sanskrit to these languages."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de ye Sanskrit labaarali dɔgɔya?","The correct answer is **A: Gɛlɛya**.

The passage states ""...Sanskrit binna ka a sabu kɛ **fanganasira** ye.""  ""Fanganasira"" translates to ""grammatical structure"" or ""complexity"". Thus, the passage indicates that Sanskrit declined due to its complexity.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kumasen jumɛn ye tiɲɛ ka ɲɛsin lo munumunu cogo ma?","The correct answer is **D: Dugukolo ka munumununi b’i sama kosɛbɛ ka tɛmɛ lo munumununi kan**

Here's why:

* The passage states that a person who weighs 90 kg on Earth weighs only 16 kg on the Moon. This indicates that the Moon's gravity (munumununi) pulls on objects with less force than Earth's gravity. Therefore, Earth's gravity pulls on you more strongly than the Moon's gravity.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu kumasen jumɛn be Kalo kɔfara ɲɛfɔ ka ɲɛ?","Let's analyze the passage and the options:

The passage states:

*   Kalo kɔfɛra be wele ko kɔfarajalen. (The moon's atmosphere is called kɔfarajalen.)
*   Kɔfara jalen bɔɲan be kilomɛtiri 70 bɔ nin gɛrɛra la ani kilomɛtiri 100 bɔɲa nin ka jan la. (The height of the atmosphere is 70 km on the short side and 100 km on the long side.)
*   A ka dɔgɔ nin be tasumajisisikulu gɛrɛfɛ ani ka bɔn nin be sanfɛra legelegew la. (It is smaller than the Earth's atmosphere and bigger than the moon's legelegew).
*   Tasumajisisikuluw camaw be sɔrɔ fan gɛrɛlen na bari kɔfara jalen ka min sen. (The atmospheres of the Earth are present on the short side because the atmosphere kɔfarajalen touches it).

Now let's examine the options:

*   **A: Kɛrɛ gɛrɛlen Kɔfara ka bon** means ""The short side, the atmosphere is big"". This is incorrect because the passage doesn't state that atmosphere is ""big"" on the short side. The Earth's atmosphere is bigger than the Moon's.
*   **B: Kɔfara ka dɔgɔn legelegew duguma** means ""The atmosphere is smaller than legelegew duguma"". This is incorrect, the passage says it is bigger than the moon's legelegew (A ka dɔgɔ nin be tasumajisisikulu gɛrɛfɛ ani ka bɔn nin be sanfɛra legelegew la).
*   **C: A be se ka kɛ tasumajisisikulu ka dɔgɔn kɛrɛ jan fɛ** translates to ""It can be smaller than the Earth's atmosphere on the long side."" The passage says 'A ka dɔgɔ nin be tasumajisisikulu gɛrɛfɛ', which means it is smaller than Earth's atmosphere. So it can be smaller on the long or short side.
*   **D: A be se ka kɛ tasumajisisikulu ka dɔgɔn legelegew duguma** translates to ""It can be smaller than the Earth's atmosphere than legelegew duguma."" Because we know from C: A be se ka kɛ tasumajisisikulu ka dɔgɔn kɛrɛ jan fɛ, we can confirm the part ""tasumajisisikulu ka dɔgɔn"" which means it can be smaller than the Earth's atmosphere.

Therefore, both C and D are similar but C is a better answer because it's a general statement.

**Therefore, the correct answer is C.**"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Kalo kɔfara ka bon kosɛbɛ yɔrɔ jumɛn?","The correct answer is **C: Legelegelew duguma**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""A ka dɔgɔ nin be tasumajisisikulu gɛrɛfɛ ani ka bɔn nin be sanfɛra legelegew la.""  This means the moon's crust is *thinner* near the concentration of volcanoes and *thicker* at the location of the highlands. Therefore, the crust is thickest at the location of the highlands.
"
"Ka da tɛmɛsira in kan, mɔgɔdɔw dalen bɛ jumɛn na?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Diɲɛnatigɛ be dugukolo wɛrɛw kan (Life exists on other planets)**.

The passage states that some people believe that aliens or other forms of life exist on other planets (""dɔw daleno ala ko aliyɛniw walima ɲɛnɛmaya wɛrɛ be balola lala dugukolo wɛrɛ kan""). This directly supports the idea that some people believe life exists on other planets.
"
Mun de bɛ dɔgɔya ka t’a fɛ n’i be k’a janya tile camancɛ la?,"The correct answer is **C: Gazi**

The passage states: ""Gazi bɛ dɔkɔya ka taa a fɛ n'i bɛ ka i ma janɲa tile camancɛ la."" This translates to ""Gas decreases as you move away from the center of the sun.""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, tile fan jumɛn de be ye k’i to Dugukolo kan?","The correct answer is **C: Fotɔsefɛre**.

The passage states ""Anw bɛ tile kɔkanna fan min ye n'an bɛ tile lajƐ tɔgɔ ye fotɔsefƐre, min kɔrɔ ye """"yeelen kuru""""."" which means ""The outermost part of the sun that we see when we look at the sun is called the photosphere, which means """"sphere of light""""."" This directly answers the question.
"
Nin jateminɛli jumɛnw de ye dɛmɛlikɛ ka Copernicus ka hakilina sinsin?,"The correct answer is **A: Venus kɛrɛw** and **B: Venus tɛmɛsira**.

Here's why:

*   **Venus kɛrɛw (Venus' phases):** The passage states that Galileo's observation of Venus' phases, similar to the moon, supported the idea that Venus orbits the Sun. This aligns with the Copernican model.

*   **Venus tɛmɛsira (Transit of Venus):** The passage mentions that Jeremiah Horrocks observed the transit of Venus. This observation provided further evidence that supported the heliocentric model and helped refine the astronomical calculations of the time.

The passage does not suggest that the sun and venus or sun and the moon are the same, so that is not the answer.
"
Ninnu jumɛn de jateminɛna Galileo Galilei fɛ san 1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Venus kɛrɛw**.

The passage states: ""san 1610, dugukolokoɲɛɲinikɛla ka bɔ Italie Galileo Galilei ye jateminɛ kɛ telescope la ka ye ko kɛrɛw bɛ Venus la, i n'a fɔ kalo."" This translates to ""In 1610, the astronomer from Italy Galileo Galilei used a telescope and observed that Venus has phases, like the moon.""

Therefore, Galileo Galilei observed the phases of Venus in 1610.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Amazon Ba bɛ ji sɔrɔ min?","The correct answer is **A: Ba fitininw**.

The passage states ""A be sɔrɔ kabɔ ba bayirikaw fitiniw la"" which translates to ""It is obtained from small tributaries"".
"
Nin tanunin jumɛn tɛ talikɛ Amazon Ba la?,"The correct answer is **D: ba bɛ la wagalen do** (It is a shallow river).

The passage describes the Amazon River as the second longest and largest river in the world. It also highlights its great depth at times. Therefore, options A, B, and C are all characteristics mentioned in the passage. The passage does not suggest it is shallow, so option D is the correct answer to the question which is asking what is *not* a characteristic of the river.
"
Baarada jumɛn de kofɔlen do tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ ni Venezuwelaka hakɛ bɛla fitinin de bɛ baara kɛ yen?,"The correct answer is **C: Taji**.

Here's why:

*   The text states, ""...hali n'a sɔrɔ kɛmɛsarada kelen dɔrɔn de bɛ baara kɛ tajibayɛlɛmacakɛda la."" (Even though only one percentage is working in the oil industry).

This clearly indicates that the oil industry has the smallest percentage of Venezuelans working in it compared to the other sectors mentioned."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu cakɛda jumɛn bɛ Venezuwelaka hakɛ bɛ la caman ta?","Based on the text, here's the breakdown:

*   **Forobacakɛda:** 2 Venezuelans work here.
*   **Bayɛlɛmacakɛda:** 4 Venezuelans work here.
*   **Sɛnɛda (Agriculture):** 5 Venezuelans work here.
*   **Taji (Oil):** Only 1% of the 18% of workers are employed in the oil sector. Since 18% of Venezuela's labor force is being discussed, this means only a very small fraction of that 18% work in the oil sector.

Therefore, **Sɛnɛda (Agriculture)** employs the most Venezuelans out of those specifically listed. However, Agriculture is not a choice.

Of the provided choices, **Bayɛlɛmacakɛda** employs the most Venezuelans (4).

So the answer is **C: Bayɛlɛmacakɛda**
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, dolo ka ɲagami b’a yamaruya ka mun kɛ?","The passage states: ""Dolow be yeelen ni funteni di k'a sabu kɛ fanga bɔ ta ye ni idorozƐne kisɛw bɔra (walema ka ɲagami) ɲɔkɔn fɛ ka kɛ dengirimanw ye."" This translates to: ""Dolow produces light and heat due to the release of energy and hydrogen atoms coming together (or mixing) to form heavier atoms.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Ka yeelen ni funteni bila (To release light and heat)**.
"
Yeelendimansindorokolen ɲuman ninnu jumɛn bɛ mun dilan?,"The answer is **D: Yeelen**

The passage states that researchers are working to create a device that produces light (yeelen) in a specific way. The main topic of the passage is light and its production.
"
Ji dilannen do ni simi fɛn jumɛnw ye?,"The text states: ""Ji kulu dilan neno nin idorozɛni ani ɔkisiziyɛni atomi ne ye."" This translates to ""A water molecule is made up of hydrogen and oxygen atoms."" More specifically, it should read ""A water molecule is made up of hydrogen and oxygen atoms."" The common knowledge is that a water molecule is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **D: Idorozɛni kisɛ fila ani ɔkisiziyɛni kisɛ kelen** (Two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom)"
"Ni ji y’a cogo falen, mun bɛ to a nɔ na?","The correct answer is **A: Molekiliw cogoya**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Alina sɔrɔ a farikolo cogoya be seka falen, a dilan cogoya simila be t'a nɔna"" which means ""Even if its physical state changes, its composition remains the same"". ""Molekiliw cogoya"" translates to ""Molecular composition"", which is essentially the same thing as ""dilan cogoya"" in the passage.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn tun tɛ gɛlɛya ye jamanabolo tannisaba kan kuma min a tun b’a fɛ ka sariya dɔw jagoya sigi?","Let's analyze the passage to determine which option was *not* a difficulty faced by the thirteen colonies under the Articles of Confederation.

*   **P:** Explicitly states: ""Fanga foyi tun te Wasabulon bolo ka nisɔngɔ sigi senkan...a tun be a sinsin jamanabolo ɲɛmɔgɔw kan, minnuw tun te son tuma dɔw la k'aka sariya labaara"" which translates to: ""The government had no power to impose tariffs... it relied on state governments, who often wouldn't enforce the laws"" and ""Sariyasen nunuw tun kakan ka yamaruya sɔrɔ jamanabolow bɛɛ fɛ yani uka yɛlɛma wa jamanabolow tun ma cɛmancɛ marabolo in jate kaɲɛ"" which translates to ""Changes required unanimous consent of the states, and the states didn't respect the central government""

Now let's look at the options:

*   **A: Kɔlɔsili gɛlɛn ka bɔ fanga ɲɛmɔgɔw yɔrɔ - Difficult oversight from powerful authorities:** This is mentioned in the passage, as the individual states often wouldn't enforce laws passed by the central government.

*   **B: Fanga tanya Wasabulon kɔnɔnana - Lack of power within the central government:** This is explicitly stated. The central government lacked the power to impose tariffs and enforce laws effectively.

*   **C: Yɛlɛmali minnu bɛ jamanabolow bɛɛ ka yamaruya jagoya - Changes requiring unanimous consent of the states:** This is also explicitly stated. All states had to agree for changes to be made.

*   **D: Ɲɛmɔgɔ fanga tanya - Lack of leadership power:** While the passage mentions the lack of power in the central government, it doesn't directly highlight a ""lack of leadership power"" as a distinct problem. The main issue was the states' unwillingness to comply with the central government's decisions. The passage focuses on the *distribution* of power (or lack thereof at the federal level) rather than the *quality* of leadership.

Therefore, the best answer is **D**. The passage doesn't explicitly describe a lack of leadership power as a key problem, but rather focuses on the lack of federal authority and the difficulty of getting states to comply."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kumasen jumɛn de bɛ cɛmacɛ marabolo ka jamanabolow jira ka ɲɛ yɛrɛmahɔrɔnya Kɛlɛ waati la?","The correct answer is **D: Cɛmacɛ marabolo tun ye fɛn koloman fila ye**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the thirteen colonies established a ""weak central government"" under the Articles of Confederation. ""Weak"" indicates that the central government lacked authority and power, making it essentially fragile or ""koloman"".
*   Option A is incorrect because the passage mentions that the central government did NOT have the power to impose tariffs (nisɔngɔ) - the power was with the states (jamanabolo ɲɛmɔgɔw).
*   Option B is incorrect because the passage states that the colonies had to accept a law before it was ratified
*   Option C is incorrect as the text doesn't talk about there not being representatives from each colony."
Daɲɛw sɛbɛnnen do cogodi Yɛrɛmahɔrɔnya Ɲɛfɔli Gafe in kɔkan?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Sɛbɛnni kumaba la**.

The text states: ""Yɛrɛmahɔrɔnya  Gafe in kɔkanna **Sebɛnniw** tun ye ''Yɛrɛmahɔrɔnya Ɲɛfɔli Gafe Yɛrɛyɛrɛ  min dansigira Zuyekalo tile 4 nan san 1776''"".  This indicates the words ""The Declaration of Independence"" are written on the cover of the Declaration.  The passage doesn't suggest it's in code, on the edge, or in small letters, so assuming it's the title, it's more likely to be large, so *kumaba* is the best choice.
"
Sɛngapuri lakodɔnnen do ni ninnu jumɛn ye?,"The passage focuses on Singapore's transformation and its national flower. It doesn't mention any of the options A, B, C, or D. However, the closest association with the given passage would be **A: Dugubakɔnɔ jirifalen** (Indoor gardening/Urban greenery). This is because the passage mentions Singapore transforming into a ""duguYirifalenyɔrɔsumamanba"" (city garden).

Therefore, the most relevant answer is **A**.
"
Vanda Miss Joaquim ye mun ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Feere dɔ**

The text states ""San 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, feerewoloso dɔ min tara ka kɛ jamana feere ye."" which directly translates to ""In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, a type of orchid, was chosen as the national flower.""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Giza piramidiw kalite jumɛn tun tɛ kɛ ka kon ka Ezipitikaw Masamara Kura dabaliban?","The correct answer is **C: U kundama**.

Here's why:

*   **P:** Passage P states that the pyramids were built beginning from the Old Kingdom until after the New Kingdom, and highlights the impressive quality of the Giza pyramids in terms of size and construction. Ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom continued the building of monuments that had a lot of years and stone to them.
*   **Q:** Question Q asks about a quality of the Giza pyramids that was NOT matched by the later New Kingdom monuments.

Therefore, the passage primarily emphasizes the *size* and *construction* of the Giza pyramids as being particularly impressive. While the New Kingdom Egyptians also built with stone and labored greatly, they did not match the *size* of the Giza pyramids."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, bindunbaganw be bɔ yɔrɔ jumɛn ka yaala sanji nɔfɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Worodugu lɛw**

The first sentence of the passage states that 1.5 million wildebeest migrate *from* the south (*worodugu*) heading north.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, bindunbaganw be to ka segin ka bɔ yɔrɔ kelen jumɛn Avirili waati?","The correct answer is **C: Ba Mara**.

The passage states that after the wildebeest migrate north and cross the Mara River, ""u bɛ baani na tilebin fɛ, ka Ba Mara tigɛ tugunni, sanw kɔfɛ Avirili waati"" which translates to ""they return west, crossing the Mara River again, years later in April"". This clearly indicates that they are returning *from* the Mara River area in April.
"
Kɔkɔjiwara Kɛlɛwale tun ye jamana jumɛn minɛli ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Biritaɲi**

The passage states that Germany planned to invade Britain with Operation Sea Lion.
"
Alimaɲi bɛ Biritaɲi minɛli weele jogodi?,"The correct answer is **B: Kɔkɔjiwara Kɛlɛwale**.

The passage states that Germany's secret operation to invade Britain was called ""Kɔkɔjiwara kɛlɛwale.""
"
Mun de fɔra k’o ye Itali ka laɲini fan kologɛlɛn dɔ ye walasa ka Farafinna jamanaw sɔrɔ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka kɛlɛkulu ciyɔrɔ dɔ sigi**.

The passage states that ""Walasa ko jamanaw sɔrɔ, u tun mako be kɛlɛkulu dɔ ciyɔrɔ la walasa kɛlɛkuluw ka se ka Mediterane kɔkɔji cɛci ka Farafinna minɛn.""  This directly says that needing to establish a military base was essential for conquering African nations.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsiran in ye, mun tun jatilen do inafɔ Itali ka kɛlɛ laɲini fanba?","The correct answer is **A: Ka Farafinna jamanw minɛ**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Itali ka laɲini fanba tun ye Farafinna jamanaw ye"" which translates to ""Italy's main goal was African countries.""
"
Jɔni tun ye teriya kɛ ni binkanikɛlaw ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Faransi Vichy**.

The passage states that ""Faransi ''Vichy''"" collaborated with the Germans (""Alimaɲi kaw""). This indicates they were allied or at least cooperating with the aggressors.
"
Farankan kulu jumɛnw tun sen dona Daragɔn Kɛlɛwalen la?,"The correct answer is **A: Ameriki kaw ni Faransi labilalenw**.

The text states that ""Dogokun fila dɔrɔn Ameriki kaw ni Faransi labilalenw ka kɛlɛbolow ye Faransi baba bolo labila..."" which means that American and Free French forces participated in the liberation of France.
"
Subahanamansi jumɛn yiriwali kɛra sababu ye jijukɔrɔkurun diyagoyara ka boli ji jukɔrɔ?,"The correct answer is **D: Jateminɛ-mansi**

The text states that ""tuma minna jateminɛ-mansin yiriwala ka jaw jɛ jijukɔrɔkurunw jagoyala ka don jijukɔrɔ walasa k'u yeli bali."" This directly translates to ""when the calculating machine was developed, it allowed for precise targeting of submarines, encouraging them to submerge to avoid detection."" This makes it clear that the calculating machine (jateminɛ-mansi) was the reason submarines went underwater.
"
"U labaarakofɔlɔ kɔnɔ, jujukɔrɔkurun ka mun hakɛ tun ka dɔgɔn kosɛbɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Mugucili**

The passage states: ""Jijukɔrɔkurunw labaarala Diyɛn Kɛlɛba I ni Diyɛn Kɛlɛba Il senfɛ. O waati u tun ka suma ani u ka muguci kuntaala tun ka surun."" This translates to: ""Submarines were used during World War I and World War II. At that time they were slow and their attack range was short.""

Therefore, in their early use, the attack range (mugucili) of submarines was very limited.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔni tun ma bɛnka labato? ","The text states that the Soviet Union violated several agreements by invading Poland. These agreements included the Riga Peace Treaty, Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties. Therefore, the group that didn't respect the agreements was the Soviets.

So the answer is:

D: Soviet kaw
"
Ninnu jumɛn kelen tun ma kɛ Red Army fɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukraine kɛlɛyɔrɔ dilanni**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ukraine kɛlɛkɛyɔrɔ bolo u kɛnikɔ ka Pɔlɔɲi kɔrɔn maarayɔrɔ minɛ nin..."" This indicates that the Red Army already *held* the Ukrainian area (""Ukraine kɛlɛkɛyɔrɔ *bolo*""). They did not *create* it (dilan). They used that position as a base to then seize territories in eastern Poland.
* **B: Kɔrɔn maarayɔrɔw minɛli (Seizing eastern territories):** The text explicitly says they seized these territories (""...Pɔlɔɲi kɔrɔn maarayɔrɔ minɛ"").
* **C: Dilani Romanie kɛlɛlabɛn yɔrɔ (Creating a bridgehead in Romania):** The first sentence mentions this was an attempt to ""create a bridgehead into Romanian theater of war"". This was an action they *attempted*.
* **D: Bɛnkan labatobaliya dɔ (Ignoring treaties):** The last part says that their action violated various treaties and agreements.

Therefore, only option A is not an action the Red Army took, according to the text. They *had* the Ukrainian region, not *created* it.
"
Mun de tun ye Itali Tenth Army Mansimanfɛbaara-Ɲɛmɔgɔ sɔrɔ?,"The correct answer is **C: Biritaɲi kaw tun y’a minɛ** (British forces captured him).

"
Itabo Balbo tun fakara yɔrɔ jumɛn?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu fɛɛrɛw jumɛn kelen ye Tibetan tasili fan nafama do ye?","The correct answer is **C: Maaw canman lajɛli**

The passage states: ""Tibetan tasili camacɛ ye Deity Yoga ye. Nin maaw cama lajɛli ye, fagan bɔndaw be sanuya, fagan tɛmɛsira be dayɛlɛ ani yele doli farikolo bɔnda be ɲɛmayala.""  This directly identifies ""maaw cama lajɛli"" (visualizing many deities) as a key aspect of Deity Yoga, which is described as the most common form of Tibetan tantra.

While the passage mentions yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and meditation in the context of Kundalini Yoga (which influenced Tibetan Buddhism), it specifically highlights deity visualization as central to Tibetan tantra (Deity Yoga).
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, fanga tɛmɛsira be dayɛlɛ cokodi Tibetan tasili “camancɛ” kɔnɔ?","The passage states: ""Tibetan tasili camacɛ ye Deity Yoga ye. Nin maaw cama lajɛli ye, fagan bɔndaw be sanuya, fagan tɛmɛsira be dayɛlɛ ani yele doli farikolo bɔnda be ɲɛmayala.""

This translates to: ""The most common form of Tibetan tantra is Deity Yoga. This is the visualization of many deities, energetic blockages are purified, energy channels are opened, and the subtle body is transformed.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Ni maaw canman lajɛli ye (With the visualization of many deities)**.
"
Jɔni tun ye bato fɔli filanan kɛ bakuruba in kɔnɔ?,"The text says that Sanju Sharma started the sufoli, followed by Shankar Choudhary. Then Lakkha Singh took over the bahjans singing. The question asks who performed the second devotional song (bato fɔli) during the bakuruba.

So the answer is **B: Lakkha Singh**
"
"Ka kɛnɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔni tun ye bato fɔli dɔ kɛ dumuni di waati kɔnɔ?","The answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The passage states ""Lakkha ye chappan bhajan fana yira."" Since chappan bhog is a food offering, and he performed a bhajan connected to it, he performed music during the food offering.
"
Su fɔli -laban filanan tun ye jumɛn ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Fire of Anatolia**.

The passage states: ""K'a laban, Turquie donkulu Fire of Anatolia ye """"Troie """" kɛnɛyira kɛ."" which translates to ""Finally, the Turkish dance group Fire of Anatolia performed """"Troie""""."" This means Fire of Anatolia was the last performance.
"
Alessandro Safinna ye jamana jumɛn den ye?,"The passage states ""Turquie dɔnkilidaraŋana Sezen Aksu donna kɛnɛ kɔnɔ ni **Italieka Alessandro Safina** ni Girɛsi donkilidala Haris Alexiou ye.""

Therefore, Alessandro Safina is Italian (Italieka).

The correct answer is **D: Italieka**
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu kumasen jumɛn te tiɲɛ ye?","The correct answer is **B: Mɔgɔw tun balannen do sanfɛ-tulokɛ mɔbilini la**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Tasuma tun wuli la Santa Clara** (A fire was in Santa Clara) - The passage mentions ""Santa Clara ni kalaya hakɛ 90w ye,"" implying a fire with heat levels of 90 degrees in Santa Clara.
*   **C: Ji tun dira taamadenw ma** (Water was given to the travelers) - The passage explicitly states ""Ji tun dira taamadenw ma.""
*   **D: A dɔgɔyalen, mɔgɔw be miniti 60 kɛ sani mɔgɔ fɔlɔ ka lajigin** (At the very least, people were spending 60 minutes before the first person could descend) - The passage says ""w'a ye lɛrɛ kelen ta yani mɔgɔ fɔlɔ ka lajigin"" wich translate to ''it would take one hour until the first person comes down'' wich equals 60 minutes.
*   **B: Mɔgɔw tun balannen do sanfɛ-tulokɛ mɔbilini la** (People were trapped on the cable car) - The passage does not say people were trapped in the cable car. It only says, ""Lajɔli sanfɛ-tulokɛ mɔbilini kan lafiya te ala"" (Waiting in the cable car isn't safe at all). This statement does not imply entrapment, only that waiting isn't safe.

"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔn tun ye hakilina di ka ɲɛsin mɔgɔw ka lafiya baliya la funteni hakɛ fɛ?","The correct answer is **B: Tasuma kɛlɛbolo ɲɛmɔgɔ**.

The passage states that ""Tasuma Kɛlɛbolo ɲɛmɔgɔ Scott Kouns tun ko..."". Scott Kouns is the fire chief, and he is the one who mentions the danger and discomfort associated with the high temperatures.
"
Kuran tun tigɛra min ka sabu kɛ tsunami wale ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The passage states, ""...kuran tun tigɛra waati kunkuruni kɔnɔ min ye a  to Tonga famaw tun te se ka tsunami lasɔmili sɔrɔ ka bɔ PTWC yɔrɔ la."" This translates to ""electricity was cut off for a short time, which prevented the Tongan authorities from receiving tsunami warnings from the PTWC."" This shows that the electricity outage happened in Tonga.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kuran tigɛ in tun ye mun de se Tonga ma?","The correct answer is **D: Famaw tun ma se ka lasɔmili jɔnjɔnw sɔrɔ**

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""...kuran tun tigɛra waati kunkuruni kɔnɔ min ye a to Tonga famaw tun te se ka tsunami lasɔmili sɔrɔ ka bɔ PTWC yɔrɔ la."" This directly translates to ""the electricity was cut off for a short time which made it so the government of Tonga were not able to receive tsunami warnings from the PTWC."" This means they were unable to receive essential warnings."
Waati jumɛnna lakanatigilamɔgɔw tun sera ka teliyasumanikɛlaw kɛ ka Jonny Reid ka boli teliya suma?,"The correct answer is **A: Tuma min’a tun bɛ ka boli km 160 nɛgɛ kanɲɛ kelen kɔnɔ** (When he was running 160 km per hour).

The passage states: ""tuma kelen min na u sera ka Mr Reid ka boli teliya suma o kɛra waati minna a bolila km 160 kan nɛgɛ kanɲɛ kelen kɔnɔ"" (The only time they could measure Mr. Reid's speed compared to the speed traps was when he was going 160 km per hour).
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, munna a tun gɛlɛya la New Zealand lakanatigilamɔgɔw fɛ ka Jonny Reid ka boli teliya suma?","The correct answer is **B: Mɔbili tun ka suma ka tɛmɛ**.

The passage states ""...New Zealand lakanatigilamɔgɔw ye gɛlɛya sɔrɔ walasa ka Mr Reid ka boli teliya suma ni teliyasumanikɛlaw ye bawu Black Beauty ka surun..."" This clearly says that the difficulty in assessing Reid's speed was due to Black Beauty being small/compact (surun means short/small).
"
Yɔrɔ jumɛnna dugukoloyɛrɛyɛrɛ kɛrɛ a ni Butte cɛman cɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Nɔngɔnɲɛ 40 worodugu fɛ**

The passage states the earthquake was 65 miles south of Butte. While none of the answers match exactly, option B ""Nɔngɔnɲɛ 40 worodugu fɛ"" is closest to being the correct answer.

It seems there might be an error in either the passage or the answer choices, as none of them perfectly reflect the provided information. However, based on the information given, option B is the most logical.
"
Mun tun kɛra Abu Ghraib ka kasobɔn wolikajɔ senfɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ameriki finitigiw tun ye fanga minɛ**

The text states that the prison became famous after it was known that atrocities occurred *after* American forces took control.
"
Munna Iraqi kasobɔn tun ye tɔgɔbasɔrɔ? ,"The correct answer is **C: Danmantɛmɛ walew tun ka ca** (Danmantɛmɛ walew tun ka ca means ""Torture was widespread"").

The passage explicitly states that the Abu Ghraib prison became famous/notorious after it became known that abuses (danmantɛmɛ walew) occurred there after American forces took control. Therefore, option C is the most direct and accurate answer to why the prison became well-known.
"
Ɲɛnajɛ sugu jumɛn tun bina kɛ Maui Kɛlɛ Hakilijigin Ntolatankɛnɛ kan?,"The correct answer is **C: Kɔnsɛri** (Concert).

The passage states that a ""fɔlijɛkulu in ka fɔli bɔra"" which translates to ""a band was supposed to perform"". Bands perform at concerts.
"
Jɔnni tun ye kun jɔnjɔn fɔ ka ɲɛsin ɲɛnajɛ bɔli y’ama ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ɲɛmɔgɔyaso ba in (The management company)**.

The passage states that ""FɔlijƐkulu in ɲƐmɔgɔyaso ba, HK Management Inc. ma kun jɔnjɔn fɔ tuma minna u ye a bɔ ama..."" which translates to ""The band's main management company, HK Management Inc. didn't give a reason when they withdrew...""  Therefore, it was the management company that didn't provide a reason.
"
Jɔnni tun miirila Bishkek sigibagaw caman tun nɔ bɛ sonyali in la?,"The passage states: ""Bishkek sigibagaw caman tun jigina mɔgɔmurutiniw la ka bɔ worodugu fɛ sariya bonyabaliya la."" This translates to: ""Many Bishkek residents blamed criminals from the south for the lawlessness.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Mɔgɔmurutiniw (Criminals)**
"
Jɔnni tun jigina mɔgɔmurutiniw la ka bɔ worodugu fɛ sonyali in na?,"The correct answer is **A: Bishkek sigibagaw**.

The passage states: ""Bishkek sigibagaw caman tun jigina mɔgɔmurutiniw la ka bɔ worodugu fɛ sariya bonyabaliya la,"" which translates to ""Many Bishkek residents feared robbers coming from the north due to the absence of law enforcement.""
"
Waati jumɛn dɔfarala Ring ka ferew kan?,"The correct answer is **A: A bɔlen kɔfɛ Shark Tank ka**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Siminoff ye a fɔ ko dɔfarala fere kan a bɔlen a bɔlen kɔfɛ Shark Tank ka epizɔdi dɔ la san 2013..."" This translates to: ""Siminoff said that the sale spiked after appearing on an episode of Shark Tank in 2013...""
"
Waati jumɛnna Jamie Siminoff y’a laɲini ka Ring cakɛli daminɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: A bɔlen a kalama k’a ka da konko nɛkɛ tun maɲi**.

The passage states that Jamie Siminoff conceived of Ring because he realized his door buzzer was inadequate because he couldn't hear it in his garage workshop.
"
Rainbow Kalani kelen o kelen tun bi layini jumɛn se denmisɛnw ma?,"Based on the passage, Reading Rainbow encouraged children to:

*   ""Reading Rainbow yathomithagia ciana gĩtumi gĩa gũthoma,... wendo wa gũthoma -[kĩbindi kĩu] kĩendithagĩrĩa ciana kuoya ibuku na kũrĩthoma.""

This translates to: ""Reading Rainbow taught children the reason for reading,... the love of reading - [the show] made children want to pick up a book and read it.""

Therefore, the answer is:

*   **D: Gafew (Books)**"
Mun de be se ka nɔnba bɔ Rainbow Kalani seriw bɔli a ma?,"The answer is **B: Emmy jɔnɲɔn sɔrɔbaliya**.

The prompt in the original language is about the Reading Rainbow show and mentions it won over 20 Emmy awards.  The question in the new language asks about what the number of awards is from the Reading Rainbow show. Of the options, the only one that accurately describes a number associated with the show is that it won Emmy awards.
"
Ninnu jumɛn tun ma fɔ duguɲɛmɔgɔw fɛ Amsterdam ni sekonidɔnkomaraso fɛ ka ɲɛsin yiri in ma?,"Based on the provided text (P), the following statements *were* made by the activists:

*   **C: Biyɛlɛnbaana y’a minɛ** (The tree is affected by disease - specifically ""biyɛlɛnbaana"")
*   **D: A bɛ mɔgɔw ka kɛnɛya bila ngalama na** (It puts people's health at risk).

The statement that was **NOT** explicitly stated by the activists, but instead was the REACTION of others is the fact that they **wanted to protect the tree**, as they were protesting against it being cut down. Also, we know that it was cut down.

Therefore, the answer is:

**A: A tun te se ka bali bini ma cogosila** (It cannot be protected from falling - which refers to its inability to be saved).

**Explanation:**

The passage focuses on the activists' worries about the tree's disease and the risk it poses. It doesn't mention that the tree was deemed not able to be saved. However, since the passage states that the tree was cut down despite protests against it, this option is more in line with what the activists probably did not say.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni RSPCA fɛsɛfɛsɛli ɲɛmɔgɔba fɛla ye, fɛsɛfɛsɛliw kakan ka kɛ cogoya la nin ni tɛmɛsira jumɛn ye?","The correct answer is **C: Kɔlɔsili kɛlaw sigili**

The passage states that the RSPCA is calling for CCTV cameras to be installed in all Australian slaughterhouses and that David O'Shannessy stated that kɔlɔsili (monitoring) and fɛsɛfɛsɛliw (investigations) need to be linked up.

While CCTV cameras (A) could be used for surveillance (kɔlɔsili), the best answer here is C.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de tun be se ka dɛmɛn do ka bagaw nafa sinsin Ɔstarali baganfakayɔrɔ barakɛlaw fɛ?","The correct answer is **A: CCTV ja maralanw sigili**.

The passage states that the RSPCA is calling for mandatory CCTV surveillance in all Australian slaughterhouses. This implies that CCTV cameras could help improve animal welfare by monitoring the practices in slaughterhouses.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mɔgɔ min tun minnɛn na ka baara tun ye mun ye?","The correct answer is **A: Kalanden** (Student).

The passage states ""mũrutwo ũngĩ kuumana na jũragano"" which translates to ""another student from the shooting"". Therefore, the person arrested was a student.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, tuma min kunnafoni tun be ka jɛnsɛn minɛni wɛrɛw ka, sabagatɔ joli tun janajaw be ka kɛ?","The correct answer is **D: Naani** (Four).

The passage mentions ""mathiko ma Jeff Weise na atatũ a arĩa kenda moragirwo"" (the funeral of Jeff Weise and three of the nine who were killed). Since Jeff Weise is included, the total number of funerals mentioned is four (Jeff Weise + 3 others = 4).
"
"Ni mɔgɔmurutiniw jabi ye, jamana jumɛn tun ma taɲɛn na ACTA bɛnka bolonɔbila ye?","The correct answer is **B: Polɔɲi**.

The passage states that Poland experienced large protests against ACTA, which led the Polish government to suspend the agreement. This implies that Poland initially signed ACTA but later reconsidered due to public pressure.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jamana jumɛnw tun y’a laɲini k’u ACTA doni bila kɔfɛ la?","The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

The text states: ""Latvia na Slovakia nĩ mabĩte kũrũgamia mũtaratara wa kuĩngĩra ACTA"" which translates to ""Latvia and Slovakia have taken steps to suspend the process of joining ACTA."" The other options are mentioned as having protests, but not specifically as suspending the process of joining ACTA.
"
Mɔgɔ joli tun bana na ka sabu kɛ Ipodi kalaya kojugu kasaraw ye?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**

The passage states that 60 iPods overheated, leading to fires that injured **four** people.
"
Jɔnni tun y’a fɔ ko kalaya kojugu kasaraw tun ma juguya kosɔbɛ?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

The text states: ""cakɛda in ko minni ma ko''u man jugu''"" which translates to ""the company said that they didn't think ''they are serious''"".  The cakɛda is referring to Apple, as METI had previously informed Apple about 34 incidents.
"
"A ka kumalase senfɛ, Steve Jobs tun ye mun fɔ ko Apple tun bina o lakurakura ya?","The correct answer is **B: Telefɔni in**.

The sentence in the passage states: ""A ka lɛrɛ 2 kumalase senfɛ a ko """"Bi  Apple bena **Iphone in** lakurakura ya, an bena don tariku la sisan""""."" This translates to ""After 2 hours of his speech, he said, """"Today Apple will **reinvent the Iphone**, and we will enter history now.""""""

Therefore, Steve Jobs said Apple would reinvent the **Iphone**.
"
Steve Jobs ka lɛrɛ fila kumalase tun kun ye mun ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka telefɔni kura dɔ bɔ** (To release a new phone).

The passage states Steve Jobs showed the device to the audience and took the iPhone out of his pocket. He then said, ""Today Apple will revolutionize the iPhone, we will enter history now."" This clearly indicates the introduction of a new phone.
"
Crisrina Fernandez de Krichner tun ye mun fɔ Arizantine Kɔtɔbaso la?,"The correct answer is **B: A ka wasadenya ɲini ɲaniya jiira**.

The passage states that ""Mrs Kirchner y'a kan bɔli ɲɛmɔgɔya ɲini ɲaniya jiira Arizantine kɔtɔbaso la"". This directly translates to ""Mrs. Kirchner revealed her intention to seek the presidency in the Argentine coliseum."" The phrase ""ɲaniya jiira"" means ""intention revealed"" or ""intention made clear"". Therefore, she revealed her intention to seek a seat.
"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner tun y’a wasadenya ɲaniya ɲinini kɛ yɔrɔ jumɛn?,"The correct answer is **C: Argentine kɔtɔbaso la mayili 31 ani Buenos Aires cɛ**.

The passage states: ""Mrs Kirchner y'a kan bɔli ɲɛmɔgɔya ɲini ɲaniya jiira Arizantine kɔtɔbaso la, a y'a ka san 2005 Buenos Aires marabolo wasadenya ɲinini wulikajɔ daminɛ o yɔrɔ kelen in da la."" This clearly says she announced her vice-presidential candidacy at an Argentine courthouse, on the anniversary of her 2005 Senate campaign launch in Buenos Aires.
"
ACMA ka jabiw tun ye jumɛn ye ka ɲɛsin Big Brother ma?,"The correct answer is **A: Ɲakinisariyaw tun batolen do**

Here's why:

The passage states that ACMA found Big Brother to be in violation of broadcasting regulations. This directly implies that violations *were* found (batolen do).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bɔlɔlɔ kɔnɔ ko y'a ye ko mara tun kɛn bɛ Big Brother ka bɔlɔlɔso kɔnɔ** The passage says the opposite – that rules were *not* followed in the Big Brother broadcast.
*   **C: Ɲakinisariyaw tun batolen tɛ** This contradicts the information in the text.
*   **D: Kɔnɔ tun sɔrɔlen do bɔlɔlɔkanfɛn fɛ minnu tun ka kan ka mara so dɔ kɔnɔ** This describes a specific *reason* for the violation, but the question asks for ACMA's *response*, which was finding violations."
Dan jumɛn bɛ bɔlɔlɔ kan min bɛ jate ka kɛ bɔlɔlɔkanfɛnw ye?,"The correct answer is **A: A ka kan ka taa ka segin kɛ bɔlɔlɔ kan**.

The passage states: ""Kunafonicaricakɛdaw ye sariya sigi bɔlɔlɔ kɔnɔ fɛnw kan, hali n'a sɔrɔ bɔlɔlɔkanfɛnw do, u ka kan ka mara so dɔ kɔnɔ."" which means the law applied to filmed material. The key phrase from the text to identify what constitutes recorded material is ""hali n'a sɔrɔ ja tun bɛ taa ka segin na bɔlɔlɔ kan"" meaning ""...even if images were taken to return to the film"". Therefore option A is correct.
"
Jɔn ye Ɔsitrali Liberal Party ton ɲɛmɔgɔ ye?,"The correct answer is **B: John Howard**.

The passage states that Peter Costello was likely to succeed Prime Minister John Howard as leader of the Liberal Party. This indicates that John Howard was the leader at the time.
"
Munna nikiliyɛri goni dilanyɔrɔko tɛ Ɔsitrali fɛ?,"Based on the text provided, the answer is **D: Sɔngɔ caya kojugu (Expensive cost)**.

The passage indicates that Peter Costello believes Australia should consider nuclear energy *if* it is economically viable (""N'a kɛra jagoko ye, an ka kan ka sɔrɔ."" - ""If it is businesslike, we should get it.""). This implies that the current reason nuclear energy production might not be happening is due to its high cost. Therefore, ""Sɔngɔ caya kojugu"" (Expensive cost) is the most accurate answer.
"
Jikan bolikɛla jumɛn tun ye jɔgɔndan kɛ ni yiralikɛla ka dɛmɛn ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Maciej Krezel**.

The passage states ""Polandi suranfiyɛn cɛw ka jikurubolila Maciej Krezel n'a ka yiralikɛla Anna Ogarzynska tilala jɔyɔrɔ tan ni saabanan na Super-G ɲɔgɔndan la."" This means Maciej Krezel competed with the help of a guide, Anna Ogarzynska.
"
Jamana jumɛn tun tilala ɲɔgɔndan jɔyɔrɔ tan na Super-G muso ka ɲɔgɔndan na?,"The correct answer is **A: Fɛlandi**.

The passage states that ""Fɛlandi Katja Saarinen kɛra mɔgɔ kɔnɔtɔnnan ye ni ɲɔgɔndan kelen in na"" which translates to ""Finland's Katja Saarinen placed ninth in the same competition"". Since the question asks about the women's Super-G competition, and Finland placed ninth, the answer is Finland.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kumasen jumɛn te tiɲɛn ye Blake ka?","Based on the information provided in the original text, the correct answer is **A: A tun minɛna ka to sɛni kan (He was arrested for obstructing justice)**.

The passage states ""Blake noanyitĩtwo na thitango ya kũgeria kũgirĩria wĩigĩrĩku wa igoti"" which translates to ""Blake was arrested on a charge of attempting to obstruct justice."" The other options aren't directly supported by the text.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛn ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn kelen tun ma kɛ Blake la?","The passage states the following about Blake:

*   He was charged in Birmingham Crown Court and the trial ended on August 3rd.
*   He denied the charges.
*   He claimed he used the dock to shield himself from being spat on by people.
*   He was also charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice.
*   The judge warned him he could be imprisoned for that charge.

Now let's compare this information to the answer options:

*   **A: A tun jalakila ka sabu kɛ sariya yɛlɛmali ye (He was accused of trying to pervert the course of justice):** The passage states Blake WAS charged with this, so this is something that happened to him.
*   **B: A tun minɛna (He was arrested):** The passage implies this.
*   **C: A tun ataki la ni bere ye (He was attacked with saliva):** The passage indicates he claims he was spat on, which is an attack of sorts.
*   **D: A tun fɔla ye ka tun be sɔnka ta kaso la (He was the first to say he would be sent to prison):** The passage indicates it was the JUDGE who said he could be imprisoned, not Blake.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: A tun fɔla ye ka tun be sɔnka ta kaso la**.
"
Diɲɛlaminitɔnba waatiyɛlɛma ka dɛmɛ tina kɛ ka mun kɛ?,"Based on the passage (P), the World Bank's assistance regarding climate change can be directed towards:

*   **Jison ka sobin** (option C)
*   **Jiɲuma dilanfɛɛrɛw** (implied in the passage)
*   **Sumasicaya** (option A)

The passage states: ""Musaga bɛ se ka ɲɛsin jison ka sobin, jiɲuma dilanfɛɛrɛw, ni sumasicaya ma."" which translates to ""Funding can be directed towards solar power, water management techniques, and cooling technology.""

The best single answer from the choices provided is **A: Sumasicayaw**."
"Ka kɛɲɛn ni tɛmɛsira in ye, diɲɛlaminitɔnba hakili b’ala ka mun de lakisi?","The correct answer is **A: Wari, baarafɛɛrɛdiw kan**.

The passage states: ""Diɲɛlaminitɔnba fɛnɛ hakili b'a la ka dɛmɛ laban walasa ka dɛmɛ kɛ ka ɲɛsin jamanaw ma minnu sɛgɛra waatiyɛlɛma bolo walasa ka kɔlɔlɔw kunbɛ."" This means the organization aims to help countries struggling with climate change to overcome the problems. The passage then lists examples: ""Musaga bɛ se ka ɲɛsin jison ka sobin, jiɲuma dilanfɛɛrɛw, ni sumasicaya ma."" This indicates potential areas of focus, but it doesn't specify the *organization's* ultimate goal as directly. The opening sentence specifies how these areas can be helpful in dealing with Talike diɲɛkungo tɔniw kissili ni baarafɛɛrɛdiw kan jamana wulikuraw ka sigidalakanaɲɛtaasiraw kan, so it is likely to be related to warri and baarafɛɛrɛdiw (business practices).
"
Ninnu fɛn jumɛnw ma fɔ Albert Muchanga fɛ inafɔ fɛn min bɛn ka kɛ min ka halisa?,"The correct answer is **A, C, and D**. Here's why:

*   **C: Bɔ yɔrɔ sariyaw (Rules of Origin):** Albert Muchanga explicitly mentions that they haven't agreed on rules of origin.
*   **D: Sɔnkɔn kariyaw (Tariff Concessions):** He also states they haven't agreed on tariff concessions.
*   **A: N'a sɔrɔ Benin bɛ don AFCTA la (Whether Benin should join AFCFTA):** The passage says that Albert Muchanga stated Benin *should* join. So, this is something he *did* say.

Therefore, the things he *did* say regarding what needs to be agreed upon for AfCFTA to be successful are C and D and because he said Benin *should* join that is also what was stated."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, munna sanni-ni-feere be daminɛ zuluye kalo la?","The correct answer is **B: Baarasirataabolo sariyaw ni kariyaw minnu bɛ wasa kɛ bɛ senkan.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...anw ka baarasirataabolo bɛ wasa kɛ walasa sanni ni feere ka daminɛ zuluye kalo tile mugan san 2020."" This translates to: ""...our working group is preparing so that trade can begin in July 2020."" This clearly indicates the reason for the July start date is the working group's preparations.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Atlanta Sariyakolo Kunnafonidila ye mun fɔ kalanko ɲɛmɔgɔw ma k'u jalaki?","The correct answer is **A: Atilanta Sariyakolo Kunnafonidila ka jaabi lanɔgɔli**.

The passage explicitly states that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (Atilanta Sariyakolo Kunnafonidila) published an article detailing problems with test scores and that later evidence showed answer sheets were changed by Hall and 34 other principals. This directly connects the newspaper's reporting to the issue of answer changing (jaabi lanɔgɔli).
"
"Ka sinsin kunnafoniw kan ni tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ, fɛn jumɛn tun ma fɔ Atilanta Sariyakolo Kunnafonidi sɛbɛn kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **C: San 2013 Jamana ka San Ɲɛmɔgɔ Jɔnjɔn ta baga** (That the National Superintendent of the Year award was taken back in 2013).

Here's why:

*   **A: Sɛgɛsɛgɛli jaabi taali ɲɛfɛ min tɛ deli ka kɛ:** The passage states that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution article highlighted ""gɛlɛya yira sɛgɛsɛgɛli jaabiw la"" (problems with test scores). So, the article *did* address irregularities/unusual trends in test answers.

*   **B: Daliluw mun ba jira ko sɛbɛnw ninnu tun lanɔgɔ la:** The passage says ""Daliluw y'a yira ko jaabi sɛbɛnw lanɔgɔra Hall fɛ"" (Evidence showed that the answer sheets were changed by Hall). So, the passage indicates the article contained evidence that answer sheets were falsified.

*   **D: Duguba kɔnɔ kalanko ɲɛkurayali hakilinaw:** The beginning of the passage mentions Hall's involvement in ""duguba kalanko nɛkurayali la"" (urban school reform). While the *article itself* might not be explicitly *about* reform ideas, the context given in the passage connects the scandal to her role in those efforts.

*   **C: San 2013 Jamana ka San Ɲɛmɔgɔ Jɔnjɔn ta baga:** The passage states ""O kofɛ daliluw y'a yira ko jaabi sɛbɛnw lanɔgɔra Hall fɛ, ani kalan ɲɛmɔgɔ 34 wɛrɛw, tun jalakila san 2013."" (Afterwards, evidence showed that answer sheets were falsified by Hall, and 34 other school administrators, were indicted in 2013). This describes an indictment, *not* the revoking of the award. While it's implied that the award might have been revoked due to the scandal, the passage doesn't explicitly say the *article* mentioned the award being taken back.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kunnafoni jumɛn dɔnna bɔmu cilen kɔfɛ?","The correct answer is **D: Mɔgɔw salen jate sɛbɛnciyale (The number of people who died was not confirmed)**.

The passage states ""...ɲɛmɔgɔw y'a sɛbɛnciya kase mɔgɔw 30 madimini ma, nka hakɛ laban ma dɔ halisa"" which translates to ""...officials confirmed that about 30 people were injured, but the final number was not yet known"". This implies that the final number of casualties (including deaths) was still uncertain and not confirmed.
"
"Kabini a taara Manchester City la San 2017, Jesus zuyera siyɛn joli?","The correct answer is **A: 24**.

The passage states: ""Kabi ni o kƐra, Bresil ka den y'a yɛrɛyira maci 53 la kulɔbu ye ntolantankɛ a bɛɛ la ani a ye bi 24 don."" This translates to: ""Since then, the Brazilian has appeared in 53 matches for the club in all competitions and has scored 24 goals.""
"
Ntolantan kulu jumɛn ye dolari wari miliyɔn 27 di Jesus ma walasa a ka na?,"The correct answer is **B: Manchester City**.

The passage states that ""A san 21 Jesus taara **Manchester City** la salon zanwuye kalo san 2017 ka Bresil club **Palmeriras** dolari wari miliyɔn 27 dɔ kofɔni nɔfɛ."" This means Jesus went to Manchester City in January 2017 *after* a $27 million offer was made to the Brazilian club Palmeiras. Therefore, Manchester City is the club that paid the money.
"
Ninnu kumasen jumɛn dunanjigisow kan tɛ tiɲɛn ye?,"The correct answer is **D: Dunanw fanba bɔra dugu sanuman in na**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the guest house was in Mecca (Makan) during the Hajj (Hiji). This means the guests were *in* the holy city, not leaving it.

Let's look at why the other options are true:

*   **A: Dunanw tun bɛ Makan Hiji kama** - The passage says the incident happened during the Hajj season in Mecca, indicating the guests were there *for* the Hajj.
*   **B: Dunan dɔw tun tɛ sigida la mɔgɔw ye** - The passage states all the guests were from the United Arab Emirates, therefore not local residents of Mecca.
*   **C: Dunan dɔw tun bɛ yen hiji ɲɛkɔrɔla la** - The passage mentions some guests were there to ""prepare"" for the Hajj, implying they arrived before the actual Hajj rituals began.

Therefore, option D is the only statement that is not true based on the information provided in the passage."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu kumasen jumɛn ye tiɲɛn ye?","Based on the provided text:

*   **P states:** ""Dunajigiso in dunaw tilan bɛɛ tun ye Emira Arabes Unis jamanadenw ye."" which translates to ""All the tourists of that trip were citizens of the United Arab Emirates.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **B: Dunaw bɛɛ tun ye Emira Arabes Unis jamanadenw ye (All the tourists were citizens of the United Arab Emirates)**
"
"Ka da ni tɛmɛsira in kan, kunnafoni jumɛn bɛ gasili in kan min bɛ filan filan na?","The passage in Kikuyu describes a satellite collision and its potential impact. The question in Bambara asks: ""Where can information about the findings be found on the internet?""

Looking at the Kikuyu passage, it states: ""Maumĩrĩra ma ũthuthuria nĩũkaandĩkithio rũrenda-inĩ rwao rwa internet."" which translates to: ""The results of the study will be recorded on their internet website.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **C: Gasili kɔlɔlɔ Dugukolo sanfɛ** (Internet Website)"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, fɛn jumɛn de ka kan ka sidɔn ka ɲɛsin gasili in ma?","Based on the provided information, we need to determine which statement is most likely true given the situation described in the original paragraph about the satellite collision.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Jɔn bɛna minantow yɔrɔ ɲini (John will look for a place to mine):** This has no connection to the information given in the passage about satellites.
*   **B: Satellite tun bɛ ka teliya cogodi gasili kɛ waati (Satellites are traveling at the time of the collision):** This aligns with the information, as it's explicitly stated the satellites collided while travelling at high speed.
*   **C: Kasara na cogoya jateminɛ jaabiw bɛna jɛnsɛn cogodi (Answers regarding damage and loss will be broadcast quickly):** This is a probable consequence. Assessing the damage and communicating findings would logically follow a satellite collision.
*   **D: Gasiliɲɔgɔn na dan hakɛ jati (The amount of damage from the collision has been set):** This is less certain immediately after the event. Damage assessment takes time.

Option B directly reflects information stated within the passage, and option C aligns with the likely consequences of the event, but option B is a direct statement.

Therefore, the best answer is **B: Satellite tun bɛ ka teliya cogodi gasili kɛ waati**.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛ sira in ye, Batten tun delila ka jɔyɔrɔ jumɛn sɔrɔ Ameriki Nafolotigibaw ka lisi sanfɛ ?","The correct answer is **C: 190nan**.

The first sentence of the text states that Batten held the 190th position on the list of the 400 richest Americans in 2008.
"
Batten tun ye dɛmɛ do ninnu fɛn jumɛnw ma?,"The correct answers are:

*   **A: Amerikikaw ka nafolotigiw lisi** (Batten was among the 400 richest Americans)
*   **B: Virginia Sanfɛkalansoba** (He graduated from the University of Virginia)
*   **D: Kalanyɔrɔw minnu ɲɛsin bɛ sekow ni dɔnni kalan ma** (He attended the Commerce and Business Administration School)

**Therefore, the best options are A, B, and D.**

Option C, ""Kalankɛyɔrɔ nafama caman"" (Many valuable schools), is too broad and not directly specified in the passage.
"
Fɛn jumɛn sen tɛ sariyalaɲini in kɔnɔ min ni Maraɲɛmɔgɔ Arnold Schwarzenegger ye bolonɔn bila a la?,"The correct answer is **C: Cɛnni-jeux videos feereli walima a singali kɔnni denmisɛn kɔkɔbaluw ma Californie kɔfɛ**

Here's why:

*   The text specifically states the bill focuses on preventing the sale/rental of mature-rated video games to **minors** (dɛmisɛnifitiniw) in **California** (Californie kɔnɔ).
*   Option C changes ""Californie kɔnɔ"" to ""Californie kɔfɛ"" (Outside of California) so it is not mentioned in the passage.
*   All other options are things included in the bill.

Therefore, option C is the only one that describes something NOT related to the bill."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔn ma kumadɔw mɛn minnu fɔra?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

The passage states: ""Tuma min n'a ɲinigala, Miller ko, """"Mike be kuma kɔsɛbɛ lamɛni tuma... N tun be ka n labɛn ola ne tun ma labɛn kɔsɔbɛ k'a mɛn a tun be ka min fɔ"""""" This directly translates to ""When I asked him, Miller said, """"While Mike was talking a lot... I was preparing so I didn't really prepare to hear what he was saying."""""" This shows that Miller did not hear what Mike said.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu fɛn jumɛnw bɛ tiɲɛn ye Miller ka lamɛnni kɛli la?","The correct answer is **B: A tun tɛ k’a lamɛn kɔsɛbɛ tuma min a tun bɛ k’a labɛn.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Miller ko, """"Mike be kuma kɔsɛbɛ lamɛni tuma... N tun be ka n labɛn ola ne tun ma labɛn kɔsɔbɛ k'a mɛn a tun be ka min fɔ"""""" (Miller said, ""During Mike's part of the hearing... I was preparing so I wasn't really listening to what he was saying"")
* This directly supports the statement that Miller was not listening intently because he was preparing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Duvall ye Miller dabali ban lamɛnni tuma na** - The passage says Duval questioned Miller intensely, not that Duval stopped listening to Miller
*   **C: Duvall den fila tun kumana kosɛbɛ lamɛnni tuma** - The passage doesn't say that both of Duvall's children were talking at the hearing.
*   **D: A tun tɛ ka Duvall ka kokɔrɔ laseli lamɛn kosɔbɛ** - The passage doesn't say that he was not listening to Duval's elder testimony, but that during the Mike's part he was preparing to speak."
Jɔnni ye ‘Fiyɛn Jɛlen Sariyasen’ in yɛlɛmani laɲini kɛ?,"The correct answer is C: Jack Layton.

The passage states: ""Layton tun ye KɔnsƐrvateriw ka Tɔn ka sigida sariyasen in yɛlɛmani laɲini ani PM ka ɲɔgɔnye senfɛ ka laɲini kɛ  ka sigida sariyasen """"bɛɛ segikanni dafalen"""" kɛ."" This clearly indicates that Jack Layton sought to amend the ""Fiyɛn Jɛlen Sariyasen.""
"

Based on the provided text, Minisiri Ɲɛmɔgɔ John Howard argued that the ""Fiyɛn Jɛlen Sariyasen"" did *not* significantly alter the project's scope. He claimed it was merely to prevent cost overruns.
"
Acide cyanurique ni melamine bɛ fɛn jumɛn di n'u ɲakamina ɲɔgɔn na jakuma sugunɛ la ?,"The correct answer is **C: Kisɛkisɛniw**.

The passage states that cyanuric acid and melamine ""work together to form crystals"" that can block kidney function. It also says that these same crystals were found in both artificial and animal kidneys.
"
Koɲɛɲininaw tun ye baara kɛ nin infrares rouges ye ka fɛn jumɛn lajɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Kisɛkisɛni faralen ɲɔgɔn ka sokonɔ bagan sukunɛ na**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Ni kisɛkisɛni ninnu farani ɲɔgɔn kan bɛ bɛn ni minnu sɔrɔ la sokonɔnbagansukunɛ na n'a sanganna infrares rouges (FTIR) la."" This indicates that infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to analyze the combined crystals found in animal kidneys."
Jɔni tun ye Luna weele ko “Extreme ka Masamuso”?,"The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**

The passage states: ""Tommy Dreamer ko """"Luna tun ye Extreme ka Masamuso ye."" (Tommy Dreamer said ""Luna was the Extreme's Empress"").
"
Jɔni tun ye Luna weele ko “mɔgɔfamuyabali”?,"The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**.

The text states: ""Dustin """"Goldust"""" Runnels y'a hakilina di ko """"Luna tun ye mɔgɔfamubali ye i n'a fɔ ne...""  (Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels shared his opinion that ""Luna was as unhinged as me..."")
"
Mɔbili min tun ye kasara kɛ mun tun ma o mɔbilibolila in sɔrɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: A banana a kunkolo la**.

The passage states, ""Nka mɔbilibolila in banana a kunkolo la ka juguya"" which translates to ""But the driver was severely injured in the head."" This directly answers the question of what happened to the driver of the car that crashed.
"
Fɛn jumɛn tun te ye South Afrika ka ntolatancogo la rugby ɲɔgɔndan waati la?,"Based on the passage, the factors that made South Africa's rugby team impressive were:

*   **Ũgitĩri wao wa hadabu (their strong defense):** This implies they were good at preventing the opposing team from scoring.
*   **Ũmenyi wao wa kũmenyerera mũbira (their knowledge of ball control):** This indicates they were skillful at maintaining possession of the ball.
*   **Ũnyitanĩri wa athaki ao (the coordination of their players):** This suggests they worked well together as a team.

Looking at the provided options in the other language, the closest match to these factors is **A: Ekupu ka jɛkabaara cɛɲi**, which translates to ""Good teamwork.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A**."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, South Afrika ka ntolantancogo yɛlɛmana ka ɲɛn waati ɲuman na?","Let's break down the original text (translated to English) and the question to find the correct answer.

*   **Original Text (English Translation):** ""The morning was so beautiful that it was good to watch the 7's rugby, without the heat of the afternoon that quickly passed, it was a very good day for 7's rugby. The South African players played well when they beat the Zambian team 26-00, which was number five in the tournament. It looked like they had been defeated, South Africa recovered as the games progressed. Their strong defense, their ability to control the ball, and their teamwork made them look great, and they looked like the best players.""

*   **Question (English Translation):** ""According to the passage, did South Africa's performance improve over time?""

Now let's analyze the answer choices:

*   **A: Sɔgɔma nɛgɛ kanya 10:00 waati (Morning at 10:00 am):** This refers to the time of day and is irrelevant to the question of whether South Africa's performance improved.
*   **B: Celukɔlɔsili kologɛlɛyalen (Calculating the angle):** This answer makes no sense in the context of the question.
*   **C: U jigitigɛlen kɔfɛ Zanbi fɛ (After they were defeated by Zambia):** The passage states that South Africa BEAT Zambia, not the other way around.
*   **D: Ɲɔgɔndan tun be sena waati min (There was competition during the time):** The answer states there was competition, and that supports the fact that there was an improvement in South Africa's performance.

**Therefore, the best answer is D.**"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu kumasen jumɛn kelen te Sini jamana ka sɔrɔbosoni jira a cogo yɛrɛ la?","The correct answer is **D: Sini furadama ma mobili caman labɔ ka fere ka tɛmɛ Alimaɲi jamana kan**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Salo tun y'a siyɛn fɔlɔ ye Sini jamana ka mɔbili cama labɔ ka fere ka tɛmɛ Alimaɲi jamana kan w'a tɛmɛna Ameriki jamana kan"" which means that China *did* produce and sell more cars than Germany. Option D contradicts that statement.

Let's look at the other options:

*   A: The passage says ""Kabini o tuma na Sini jamana sɔrɔ yiriwara siyɛn 90."" Therefore, we know that China's economy has grown greatly since the reforms.
*   B: The passage says ""Salo tun y'a siyɛn fɔlɔ ye Sini jamana ka mɔbili cama labɔ ka fere ka tɛmɛ Alimaɲi jamana kan w'a tɛmɛna Ameriki jamana kan"". Therefore, we know that China produces and sells more cars than the US.
*   C: The passage states ""Sini jamana GDP be se ka boɲa ni Ameriki ta ye yani san tan sigiyɔrɔma fila la,"" confirming that China's GDP is projected to surpass that of the United States."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, waati juman Sini jamana GDP bena se ka tɛmɛ Ameriki jamana ta la?","The correct answer is **B: San tan sigiyɔrɔma fila kɔnɔ**.

The passage states: ""Sini jamana GDP be se ka boɲa ni Ameriki ta ye yani san tan sigiyɔrɔma fila la.""  This directly translates to China's GDP is expected to surpass the US's within two decades (san tan sigiyɔrɔma fila).
"
Hu tun y’a fɔ ko ɲɛtaa jamanaw be se ka mun kɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: K’u jagoya fɛn na min b’u ka ɲɛtaa lase sanfɛ**.

The passage states that Hu said ""[...] Nk' u mankan k'u jagoya fɛn na min be ta u ka ɲetaa, jɔyɔrɔ ani se sanfɛ."" This translates to ""They shouldn't sacrifice anything that helps their progress, position, and ascension."" Therefore, option A directly reflects Hu's statement.
"
Hu tun da ma se mun ma?,"The correct answer is **D: Jateden dɔ sinsinfin jinsinni hakɛ dɔgɔyali** (A specific target for reducing carbon emissions).

The text states ""An bena gɛlɛya anw yɛrɛ kan ka sisifin jinsinni dɔgɔya jaman ka foroba sɔrɔ (GDP) kelen kelen na bɛɛ la ni hakɛ ɲumaba ye k'a daminin san 2020 k'a jigin san 2005 hakɛ duguma."" This clearly refers to a specific target for reducing carbon emissions (sisifin jinsinni) relative to GDP, aiming to bring it below 2005 levels.

Let's examine why the other options are not as accurate:

*   **A: Songojigin hakɛ** (The amount of inflation): While inflation might be related to economic policies, the primary focus of the statement is on carbon emissions reduction targets, not inflation targets.

*   **B: Ladilikan dili ka ɲɛsin ɲɛtaa jamanaw ma nɔgɔba kunkan** (Asking for advice related to developed nations about carbon): The text doesn't primarily focus on seeking advice. Hu is rather giving advice.

*   **C: Sisifin jinsinni be na se ka dɔgɔya waati min** (The time carbon emissions will be reduced): The text does mention a timeframe (starting 2020, aiming for below 2005 levels), but the key element is the defined *target* of reducing emissions to a certain level related to GDP. Option D is a more precise description of the primary topic of the given passage.

Therefore, **D** is the best answer.
"
Nin fɛn jumɛw kelen kama Veerman y’a fɔ ko ni ko in tun ka jugun?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

The passage states: ""Medecin Sans Frontireres ka kumalasera Veerman ko: Angola tun ɲɛsinni do a ka baana ma min ɲɔgɔn ma deli ka ye u fɛ ye ani fɛnɛ a ko in ka jugu halisa **Angola** jamana kɔnɔ."" This translates to ""Veerman, from Medecins Sans Frontieres, said: Angola was dealing with a disease they had never seen the likes of before and that the matter was devastating **Angola**.""
"
"Ka sabu kɛ nɔminɛli ye, jɔn bena Huhne jɔyɔrɔ t’a ka baarayɔrɔ?","The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

The passage states that after Huhne's resignation, Ed Davey will take over his position.
"
Jɔni be na Jamana ni jamana wɛrɛw cɛ-Minisirisiya jɔyɔrɔ fa nɔminɛli in kɔfɛ?,"The text states: ""Wasaden Norman Lamp min makɔnɔnen do ka Davey nɔnabila jamana ni jamana wɛrɛw cɛ-Minisiriso la ni a lankolon do fɔlɔ.""

This translates to: ""Wasaden Norman Lamp is expected to replace Davey as the Minister of State for International Relations if his position is vacant.""

Therefore, the answer is **A: Lamb**.
"
Minbagaw b’u lamɛbagaw lasu ka mun kɛ Camille Saens foli-ni-dɔnkilida senfɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: K’u sen do ɲɛnaminisisimin la**.

The passage says: ""O kɔlɔlɔ kɛra a minbagaw bɛ ɲɛnaminisisi min caman, ani sekonidɔnkotigilamɔgɔw yɛrɛ bɛ ka u lamɛnbagaw lasu ka don a la."" This translates to: ""This behavior led to much imitation by his peers, and the second musicians themselves were pushing their listeners to participate in it."" Therefore, the minbagaw (peers) and sekonidɔnkotigilamɔgɔw (second musicians) are pushing listeners to participate in the ""ɲɛnaminisisi min caman"" (much imitation).
"
Jɔni kelen be ɲɛnaminisisi min fɔli-ni-dɔnkilida senfɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Minbagaw**.

The passage states that the criticism came from ""a minbagaw bɛ ɲɛnaminisisi min caman"". This translates to ""the criticism came from many of his/her parents/critics"". Therefore, the ""minbagaw"" are the ones doing the criticizing.
"
Leonov tun ye “dugukolokɔkan taama” min kɛ o tɔgɔ dɔwɛrɛ ye juman ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Pankurunbaara**.

The passage states: ""Marisi kile 18, san 1965, a ye pankurunbaara (EVA) kɛ..."" EVA stands for Extravehicular Activity, which is commonly known as a spacewalk.
"
Leonov bilara Union Sovietique ka cikulu juman ɲɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The passage states: ""San tan tɛmɛni kɔ, a tun ye  Union Sovietique Appollo-Soyuz cikulu ye..."" which translates to ""Ten years later, he was part of the Union Sovietique Appollo-Soyuz mission...""
"
Jɔn tun mandimina kasara in la?,"Let's analyze the provided text:

The text states that a car accident happened involving a Sirabakasara vehicle. Gibson was taken to the hospital following the accident. The text also mentions a ""Mɔbilibabolila"" (likely the car owner) who is 64 years old and was not injured in the accident. It mentions children that were crossing the road who saw the accident.

The question is ""Who was injured in the accident?"". According to the text, Gibson was taken to the hospital after the accident, implying he was injured. The Mɔbilibabolila was not injured. The text doesn't say the children were injured.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: Gibson
"
Mun tun ye kasara in kɛbaw sɔrɔw?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: U fila bɛɛ sara**.

The text states that ""Sirabakasara kɔɔfɛ, Gibson taara ka taa dɔkɔtɔrɔso dɔ la, ɲa a saara waatini o kɔfɛ"" (After the accident, Gibson was taken to the hospital, but he died later). The text also states that the driver of the car that caused the accident, who was 64 years old, died too: ""Mɔbilibabolila, min sisanga ye san 64 ye, ma madimi sirabakasara in na"".
"
Dɔnikɛla minnuw be ka baara kɛ tabolo in kan olu tun b’a laɲini ka nin fɛn jumanw kelen fanga filɛ?,"The passage states ""the study was designed to observe Sagittarius' dark matter halo."" and ""The cluster’s goal was to look at how the dark matter tidal forces and the Milky Way’s tidal forces"".

The correct answer is **D: Fɛn finmanw (Dark matter)**.
"
Dɔninkɛlaw tun be ka nin fɛnw juman kelen filɛ?,"The correct answer is **D: Sagittarius dolokulu ni Milky Way**.

The passage discusses the relationship and interaction between the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and the Milky Way galaxy, specifically how the Milky Way's dark matter affects the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
"
"Ka da tɛmɛsira in kan, kɔnsɛriwatiwu ka kɔrɔfɔw tun ma se fɛn jumɛn kan?","The passage states that public criticism of the Bush administration's handling of New Orleans reconstruction after Hurricane Katrina focused on the allocation of reconstruction contracts to people in Washington. Therefore, the concertative criticism failed to secure the correct recipients of the new building contract

So the answer is **C: Jɔn ye jɔli kura dili saratiw sɔrɔ (Who got the new building contracts)**.
"
Jɔn bɛ ka kɔrɔfɔw kɛ jɔli kura saratiw kan mun bɛ ɲɛsin fiyɛnkolonba Katrina lafiyada wilikajɔw ma?,"The correct answer is **D: Washington kɔnɔ mɔgɔw**.

The passage states that ""foroba kɔrɔfɔw y'u sinsin jɔli kura dili saratiw kan k'a di Washington kɔnɔ mɔgɔw ma"" which translates to ""public criticism focused on the conditions of awarding rebuilding contracts to people in Washington."" This clearly indicates that people in Washington are the ones receiving the criticism.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Stardust pankurun yelenw bɛna ye yɔrɔ jumɛn fɔlɔ fɔlɔ?","The correct answer is **B: Kalifɔrini kɔrɔnfɛkɛrɛ**.

The passage states, ""A bɛ na tɛmɛ Kalifɔrini kɔrɔnfɛkɛrɛn na, ni ka yeelen mɛnɛ sankolo la kabɔ Kalifɔrini ka tɛmɛ Oregon cɛmancɛ fɛ ani Nɛvada ani Idaho ni ka don Utah kɔnɔ"" which translates to ""It will pass over Eastern California, leaving a bright streak of light in the sky and it will pass from California, across central Oregon, Nevada, Idaho, and into Utah.""

Therefore, Eastern California will be the first place to see the light.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, pankuru in bɛna kɛ dan kura ye ninnu jumɛn man?","The correct answer is **C: Segili dugu kolo sanfɛ teliya dan na**.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes the rocket's **speed**: ""Kilomɛtɛrɛ 12,8 walema 8 boli segondi kɔnɔ, min teliya ye ka  bɔ SanFiransisiko ka taa Lɔsangelɛsi miniti kelen kɔnɔ."" This highlights the record-breaking speed of the rocket.

The other options are incorrect:

*   A: While it does mention light in the sky, that's not the primary point of comparison or record.
*   B: The passage doesn't focus on the visibility of the rocket over a large area.
*   D: While the passage uses the San Francisco to Los Angeles trip time for comparison, the main point is the overall speed record for returning to Earth.
"
Sira jumɛn tun bɛ Dr. Malar Balasubramanian ani Saroja Balasubramanian cɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Bamuso** (Mother).

The passage states that Saroja Balasubramanian was Dr. Malar Balasubramanian's mother (""a bamuso su sɔrɔlen kɔ"").
"
Sara Balasubramanian farikolo tun bɛ min?,"The correct answer is C: Mobili kɔfuru kɔnɔ.

The passage states ""Yen, u ye Saroja Balasubramanian su sɔrɔ yen, san 53, a dabirilen tun do ni birifiniw ye minw bɛɛ tun ye joli ye.""  ""Yen"" refers to the location where they found Dr. Malar Balasubramanian's car, therefore they found Saroja Balasubramanian's body in the trunk of the car.
"
Fɛn jumɛn sɔrɔ la eBay fɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The prompt mentions ""sikayipujɔyɔrɔ ka bon yɔrɔ minnu na"" which translates to ""places where Skype usage is high"". Therefore, eBay is interested in acquiring Skype.
"
Fɛn jumɛn de kɛli laɲinnen do ni ladilikan in ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka jɛnsɛn ka taa sigi yɔrɔ kuraw kan**.

The passage clearly states the company wants to *expand* its sales to new geographic locations: China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.  The goal is to establish a presence in these new markets. While options A and C might be positive side effects, they are not the primary stated *goal* of the strategy. Option D is irrelevant.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛ sira in ye, jɔn tun ma kumaɲɔgɔnya ni kasodenw ye minnu tun bɛ dukɛnɛ na kɛlɛ ban ne?","The correct answer is **D: Dɔkɔtɔrɔso baarakɛlaw**.

Here's why:

*   **Cɛkanfɔlaw (Mediators):** The passage states ""Cɛkanfɔlaw y'a ɲini ka ko latilen, nka kasodenw ka laɲiniw tun ma jɛya."" This means mediators tried to communicate with the prisoners.
*   **Lakanatigilamɔgɔw (Security Guards):** The passage says ""lakanatigilamɔgɔ dɔw donna dukɛnɛ na ni jamacariminaw ye ka kasodenw degun ni ɲɛjibɔgazi ye."" This clearly indicates security guards interacted with the prisoners.
*   **Tasumafagalaw (Firefighters):** The passage mentions tasumafagaraw (firefighters) managed to put out the fire.
*   **Dɔkɔtɔrɔso baarakɛlaw (Hospital Workers):** The text only mentions hospital workers taking 40 prisoners out of the prison for treatment *after* the initial conflict and fire. There's no indication they communicated with the prisoners *during* the unrest inside the prison.
"
Ninnu fɛn jumɛnw tun kɛra sababu ye a dɔ la ka kasodenw ka murutili la sa?,"Based on the passage, the most accurate answer is:

*   **B: Ɲɛjibɔgazi** (Tears gas). The text explicitly states that guards entered with tear gas to subdue the prisoners. While other factors may have contributed to the overall situation, the use of tear gas is the only direct action described in the passage as being used to quell the riot.
"
"Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hakilina la, Iran jamana kan k'a yɛrɛ bɔ siri jumɛn na?","Based on the text, the correct answer is **D: Sirili fɛn wɛrɛ la taji kola**.

The text states: ""Jamanakuntigiba, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ko u ka sirili taji la ye ikomi """"jan"""" min bɛ sena kabi Irankaw ka silamɛyayɛlɛma ma daminɛ 1979 ani jamana ka kan k'a a yɛrɛ bɔ o siri in kɔnɔ."" This translates to: ""The President, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said that their dependence on oil is like a """"chain"""" that has been in place since the Iranian Islamic Revolution began in 1979 and the country must free itself from that dependence.""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛ sira in ye, jɔn tun sɔnna ko ɲanginiw bɛ kɔlɔlɔ lase Iran Jamana sɔrɔ man ?","The correct answer is **A: Kunafoniɲinijɛkulujoniw**

The passage states: ""Jabaranisohakilinaw, minnu dira o yɔrɔ in bɛɛ, kɛra sabu ye **Iran jamana kunafoniɲinijɛkulujoniw sɔnna ko nafanba tun man ye ɲangi la**."" This translates to: ""The calculations, which were given everywhere, became the reason **Iran's intelligence agencies agreed that the pursuit of nuclear weapons was not useful**.""
"
Ninnu jumɛn sen tɛ Faransi kalata kɛ cogow la?,"The correct answer is **D: Kalata minnu jatera cɛbɔw ka cidenw fɛ** (Votes counted by representatives of candidates).

Here's why:

*   **A: Kalata kɛsu (Polling booth)**: The text explicitly mentions the ""kɛsu"" (polling booth) as the place where voters place their ballots.

*   **B: Cɛbɔw ka cidenw (Candidates' representatives)**: The text mentions that candidates can send representatives to observe the entire process.

*   **C: Bolonɔbilali kalata tɔgɔ gafe la (Signing the voter register)**: The text describes voters signing the register before placing their ballot.

*   **D: Kalata minnu jatera cɛbɔw ka cidenw fɛ (Votes counted by representatives of candidates)**: The text explains the representatives of the candidate is just there as a witness. They are not involved in the calculation.

Therefore, option D is the process that is NOT part of the French election process as described in the text."
Kalatalaw bɛ u ka cɛbɔ suganti yɔrɔ jumɛn?,"The correct answer is **B: Ɲɛnamɔgɔsugantikalatasɛbɛn kan**.

The passage states ""kalatalaw kelen bɛ taa gundosoni kɔnɔ, ka u ɲɛnamɔgɔsubantikalatasɛbɛn don foroko kɔnɔ"" which translates to ""each voter goes into a private booth and puts their ballot in the ballot box"". This means the ballot itself contains the voter's choice.
"
Fɛn jumɛn tun y'a to Allen ye san seegin ɲinini daminɛ Musashi nɔfɛ?,"The correct answer is **D: A ɲɛci kaɲɛsi kɛlɛ ma (His commitment to war)**.

The passage states: ""Allen y'a ka nafolo ba don jijukɔrɔ ɲɛɲini la w'a ya daminɛ ka Musashi in ɲini k'a da ka diyɛnkutaala kɛlɛ ɲɛci dɔ kan."" This translates to ""Allen invested a lot of his wealth in underwater searches and he started to look for Musashi because of a previous war effort (or commitment)."" This clearly indicates his motivation was tied to a past war."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Allen y'a ka nafolo ba caman do fɛn jumɛn de la?","The correct answer is **B: Jijukɔrɔla ɲɛɲini**.

The passage states: ""Allen y'a ka nafolo ba don jijukɔrɔ ɲɛɲini la w'a ya daminɛ ka Musashi in ɲini..."" which translates to ""Allen invested a large amount of his wealth in underwater search, starting his search for the Musashi...""

Ɲɛmɔgɔw kumana ko ni b'a yira ko iraniyɔmu tajibara dɔw tu pɛrɛnpɛrɛnna kasɔrɔ ka jɛnsɛn."" This means that Caesium Radioactive, Iodine, and Uranium traces were found at the site.

Therefore, the correct answers are A, B, and D.  Since only one answer can be selected, the best single answer is:

**A: Iraniyɔmu tajibara** (Uranium traces), as it is explicitly mentioned as being scattered.
"
Ninnu fɛn jumɛn tɛ lakana bila sira kanw minnu dira sigida ɲɛmɔgɔw fɛ ka di sigidamɔgɔw ma dilannikɛyɔrɔ kasara in kɔfɛ ?,"Based on the provided text, the following are the instructions given by the community leaders:

*   Stay indoors.
*   Kill mosquitoes.
*   Drink iodine.

Therefore, the only option that is NOT a precaution given by the community leaders is:

*   **C: A y'aw kɔlɔsi sisi jɛman in samani ma (Protect yourselves from the effects of the cold weather)**

So the answer is **C**."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni Dr. Moll ka hakilina ye, fɛn jumɛn gɛlɛnmanba ka ɲɛsin XDR-TB ma?","The correct answer is **D: A ka fagata ka ca** (Its high fatality rate).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ɲininkali dɔ senfɛ, a ko banasugu kura in tun ye """"gɛlɛma ba ye wa kamanagan ko ye ka d'a kan aka fagata ka ca."""" (In response to a question, he said that the new strain was a ""serious problem and a tragic thing because it's so deadly."")

The other options are also mentioned in the passage, but the most grave and emphasized concern expressed by Dr. Moll about XDR-TB is its high mortality rate. Therefore, option D is the best answer.
"
Banabatɔ joli ye banasugu kura in sɔrɔ minnu sɛbɛntiyala furakɛlikɛlaw fɛ?,"The correct answer is **D: 1**.

The text states: ""Banabaatɔ dɔw kelen be sɔrɔ ka banakisɛ in sɔrɔ kɛnɛya so in na..."" This translates to: ""One patient was found to have the disease in the hospital...""
"
NextGen sisitɛmu be ka dɔnni jumɛn na baara?,"The correct answer is **B: Sanfɛ dɔnni sɛlɛn**.

The passage states that NextGen is transitioning from ""dugukolokankunafonimansin"" (ground-based communication system) to ""sanfɛkunafonidimansin"" (satellite-based communication system) to improve air traffic control.  Therefore, it relies on information from satellites, which is the ""sanfɛ dɔnni sɛlɛn"" (satellite-based information).
"
Cogo jumɛn na NextGen ka tɔnɔ be tilen pan siraw kɔlɔsilaw ma?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **A: Pan sira surunmanw**.

Here's why:

The text states that NextGen aims to ""surunɲa ani taji digan caama nɔkɔya san o san"" which translates to ""shorten flight paths and reduce fuel consumption yearly.""  Shortening flight paths directly benefits air traffic controllers by simplifying and streamlining their work.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛ sira ye, kokɔrɔ dɔnbagaw ma FBI jalaki ka’a da u ka sinsin nin k'an?","Based on the provided text, the best answer is **C: Sinsin belebele jaajugufilɛ koɲɛw kan** (Focusing on serious violent crimes).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Tariku's group criticized the FBI for focusing on ""easy-to-solve cases,"" specifically mentioning car theft. This implies they believed the FBI should be focusing on *more* serious and difficult cases. Violent crimes would fall into that category.
* The passage also speaks of hakilina nɔgɔlenw musaka san 2005 ani ka pereperelatigɛ ko FBI ka kan ka mɔgɔ kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnen 10 ɲɛsin balikuw ka cɛnimusoya jaw ma.

The other options are less relevant:

*   **A: Ka u ka ɲɛsɔrɔ hakɛ caya** (To increase their success rate) - While implied as a motive, the primary criticism is the type of cases they are pursuing.
*   **B: Ka nafolo don kojugu ɲɛnabɔta dumanw dafɛ** (To invest in good case management) - Not directly addressed in the passage.
*   **D: Mɔbili taalenw koɲɛw** (Car theft cases) - This is the *opposite* of what the criticism is, as car theft is given as an example of cases the FBI *shouldn't* be focusing on."
Hakilina ka ɲɛsin fɛn nɔgɔlenw ma ye FBI diyagoya ka mun kɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: I sinsin kojuguw k'an minnuw be sen ka ɲɛnabɔ nɔgɔyala**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Tariku dɔnbagaw ye FBI taabolo kɔrɔw lagosi ka da kan u ye sɔrɔdaw sinsin kow kan minnu ɲɛnɛbɔli ka nɔgɔ..."" This directly translates to focusing investigations on things that are easier to solve.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   A: Nafolo caman do mɔbili taalenw koɲɛw dafɛ (A lot of money is spent completing stolen vehicle cases) - While stolen vehicles are mentioned, the primary focus is on ease of investigation, not the cost.
*   B: Cakɛda ɲɛsɔrɔli hakɛ la caya (Increasing the rate of factory production) - This refers to increasing the factory's profit margin, which is a secondary goal, but not the direct reason the FBI liked the simpler focus.
*   D: Baarakɛlaw kɛrɛnkɛrɛn jaajugufilɛ koɲɛw ma (Employees specifically for serious cases) - This describes focusing resources on easier cases, not necessarily serious ones."
Mun sera taafagalaw ka bolifɛn min naana JAS 39C Gripen bin yɔrɔ la? ,"The text states that the fire trucks (tasuma fagamobili) went to the crash site after the JAS 39C Gripen crashed. It doesn't specify why they went. So, none of the provided options directly answer the question based on the provided text.

However, the most *logical* reason fire trucks would go to a plane crash site is to put out a fire. So, inferentially, the most likely answer is:

* **C: A fodora** (It burned/It was on fire)

While not explicitly stated, this is the most reasonable assumption based on the presence of fire trucks. Therefore, I'm choosing **C** as the best answer.
"
"Ka tugun JAS 39C Gripen bin nin na, pankurun jigin yɔrɔ kun tugunna mun ɲɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Sigida Kunnafonidilaw**.

The passage states ""Yen kunafoni dilaw y' a lase ko pankunruw sow tasuma fagamobili dɔ binna u tasuma fagatɔ,"" which translates to ""Local reporters reported that the plane had crashed near a fire engine and they were extinguished."" This directly implies that local reporters (Sigida Kunnafonidilaw) provided information about the crash.
"
Brzezinski ye kunkelenna di jɔni ma faarisiw ka Erewolison waati kɔnɔ?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The passage states that Brzezinski ""ye Carter dɛmɛ ka duniya kɔnɔ kow ɲanabɔli sirawfɛ tigƐ"" (helped Carter navigate foreign policy). This indicates that he was advising or assisting Carter during the Iranian Revolution.
"
Jɔni ye jamana lakana ladilikɛla jɔyɔrɔ fa fo ka se 1977 ma?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

The passage states that Brzezinski became the National Security Advisor (NSA) ""ka bɔ san 1977 ka ta san 1981, Henry Kissinger kɔfɛ"" which translates to ""from 1977 to 1981, after Henry Kissinger."" This means Kissinger held the position before Brzezinski.
"
Nunun na jɔni ma Bobek ka baara ladege tigitigi Partizan Belgrade kɔnɔ?,"The correct answer is **D: A ye cɛbɔya kɛ tolan na ka tɛmɛ a tolantan ɲɔgɔn bɛɛ ye**.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes Bobek's record-breaking goal-scoring achievement for Partizan Belgrade. ""Mɔgɔsi wɛrɛ ma bɔli kɛ walima bi caman do jɛkulu ye ka Bobek bɔ"" translates to ""No one else has scored more goals or played more games for the club than Bobek."" Therefore, no one has exceeded him in scoring.
*   The question is ""Nunun na jɔni ma Bobek ka baara ladege tigitigi Partizan Belgrade kɔnɔ?"" which translates to ""Who has mimicked Bobek's performance in Partizan Belgrade?"". So the answer is that Bobek's performance exceeded his counterparts.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A:** focuses on the number of appearances, not necessarily his overall impact and success (which is what the question is about).
*   **B:** Is similar to D, but not as accurate as D.
*   **C:** While he was voted the best in Partizan's history, the question isn't about being voted the best player."
Dantigɛli jumɛn tɛ tiɲɛ ye Bobek ka tariku kan ka’a to Partizan Belgrade la?,"The correct answer is **C: A ye tolan tan Partizan ye fo 1995.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states he played for Partizan Belgrade from 1945 to 1958. Option C is false because it claims he played until 1995.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   A: He joined Partizan Belgrade in 1945 (true).
*   B: Bobek was from Zagreb, Croatia, which implies he likely played soccer there before joining Partizan Belgrade (true).
*   D: He became famous by playing for Partizan Belgrade (true)."
"Ka kɛɲɛn nin tɛmɛ ye, jogo jumɛn be Hesperonychus nin Velociraptor bɔ ɲɔgɔnna?","The correct answer is **B: Sen sɔnin belebeleba filanan b’a la (A big second toe claw)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Hesperonychus had a ""big second toe claw"" (sen sɔnin belebeleba filanan b’a la). While Velociraptor also had a similar claw, the passage emphasizes this feature specifically in relation to Hesperonychus's name (""western claw"").

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: Sen fila b’a la (Has two legs): Both Hesperonychus and Velociraptor walked on two legs.
*   C: Si b’a fari fan bɛ datugu len (Feathers covered its body): The passage suggests both may have had feathers.
*   D: A fari ka kalan waati bɛ (Its body is small): The passage specifically said that Hesperonychus was a small, or ""Velociraptor duden dɔ"" (small relative of Velociraptor)."
Hesperonychus kɔrɔ samanna ka bɔ dafɛn jumɛn farikolo cogoya la?,"The correct answer is **A: Sen sɔnin(w)** because the passage states that the second claw was large and led to the name ""Hesperonychus"" meaning ""western claw.""
"
Ninnu kumasen jumɛn ye tiɲɛ ye muguci kun kan?,"Let's analyze the provided information from passage P:

*   A hundred people attended a party to celebrate a couple's first anniversary, which was held after a saloon wedding.
*   Future anniversary parties are planned, according to leaders.
*   The couple was married in Texas.
*   One year after their Texas wedding, they celebrated in Buffalo with friends and family.
*   The husband, originally from Buffalo, was one of four fatally shot in a recent shooting. His wife was not hurt.

Now, let's evaluate the answer options:

*   A: Cɛ nin muso fila bɛ kun be bɔ Texas (The man and woman are both from Texas) - We know the woman is from Texas, but the passage says the husband is from Buffalo. So, this is false.
*   B: Kasaarabatɔ duuru de kun be ye (Five people died) - The passage states four people died. This is false.
*   C: U fila ye furu siri Buffalo san kelen ka kɔn (They got married in Buffalo a year ago) - The passage clearly states they were married in Texas. This is false.
*   D: Muguci kɛra Buffalo (The shooting happened in Buffalo) - The passage states that the husband, originally from Buffalo, was one of four people who died in a recent shooting. While it does not explicitly state that the shooting happened in Buffalo, it is implied that it occurred where he was living, given the context. It is also possible it happened in Texas, but the way the passage is written, Buffalo makes more sense.

Given the information, the most accurate answer is:

**D: Muguci kɛra Buffalo**
"
Dantigɛli jumɛn ye tiɲɛ ye lajɛrɛ kun kan muguci kɛra min kɛnɛ kan?,"Based on the provided text, here's the breakdown of why the answer is D:

*   The text describes a couple who got married and had a celebration.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: A kɛra furuɲɔgɔnma dɔw furu senfɛ**"
"ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛ sira ye, faama ka jɔrɔ kunfɔlɔ kun ye mun ye Luno koɲɛ la?","The correct answer is **A: Nɔgɔdonnan kurun donin ko dɛsɛ**.

The passage states that the leaders feared the submarine (nɔgɔdonnan kurunni) would miss its entry point (donni in bɔn). This translates to ""failing the entry of the submarine.""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛ sira ye, ninnu kumasen jumɛn tɛ tiɲɛ ye Luno tiyɛnli kun k'an?","The correct answer is **B: Taji jɔ hakɛ mɛtiri 100 kun bɛ kurun kɔnɔ ka’a to a tiyɛn waati** (The fuel capacity of 100 meters is inside the ship leading to its sinking).

Here's why:

*   **P states:** Luno had between 120-160 cubic meters of fuel. The passage also mentions that a 100-meter high wave threatened to disable the ship which would lead to a delay. It doesn't say the fuel *caused* the sinking or that a 100 meter fuel capacity led to its sinking.

Let's examine the other options:

*   **A: Tiyɛnli kɛra ka kɔn donin ta ɲɛ** (The sinking occurred before taking the entry) - The passage states the ship was on route to dropping off cargo when it encountered trouble.

*   **C: Baarakɛla tannifila cɛla, kelen de jogin da sɔrɔ** (Out of the seventeen workers, only one died) - The passage indicates only one person died out of seventeen.

*   **D: Kurun ɲɔninna ka ta’a dankanda la** (The ship was dragged and collided). - The passage indicates it was pulled along to collide.

Therefore, the only statement that is *not* true based on the information given is **B**."
San tan hakɛ jumɛn kɔnɔ Algeria y’a ka yɛrɛmahɔrɔnya sɔrɔ?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960 san tan kɔnɔna**.

The text states that in the 1960s, Vautier returned to the newly independent Algeria. This implies that Algeria gained its independence in the 1960s.

*   ""Yɔrɔ caama na Rome"" (Many places in Rome) - **A**
*   ""Italy dugu caama wɛrɛw la"" (Many other cities in Italy) - **B**
*   ""Duniya fan tɔw la, kɛrɛnkɛrɛnneyala Poland"" (Other parts of the world, especially Poland) - **C**

The passage also says that the people who attended the funeral in person wouldn't all be able to fit inside **St. Peter's Square (D)**.
"
Sudonni lajɛrɛ kɛra min?,"The correct answer is **D: Rome dugu kɔnɔ fɔlɔ, kɔfɛ Itali jamana duguba wɛrɛ la**.

The passage states that screens were set up in many places in Rome and other cities in Italy, as well as other parts of the world.  Therefore, the screens weren't just in Rome or just in Poland or only in St. Peter's Square, but in various locations.
"
"Ka tugun mugu fodonna, jɔni furakɛra jɔginda sɛbɛ sababu la?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

**A: A dɔgɔman ye mɔgɔ duuru ye**
"
Jɔnni tun ye gazi bɔli kumafɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: So in kɛrɛfɛmɔgɔ dɔn** (A neighbor of the house).

The text states that the gas company manager went to the scene *after* a neighbor called about the gas leak. This clearly indicates the neighbor was the one who reported the leak.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mɔgɔ joli fatura ni ataki in na?","Based on the passage, it's difficult to say definitively how many people died. The passage lists injuries sustained by four people (Alden, Cuddeback, Veguilla, and Schneider). However, it does not state that any of them died as a direct result of the injuries described. Therefore, it is impossible to ascertain the number of people who died in the attack, based on the information given. The answer could be none of these.
"
Jɔnni tun ka marifa dɛsɛra ka ci ataki in kɔnɔ?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

The passage states: ""Uka ka marifa dɛsɛra ka ci..."" which translates to ""Uka's gun failed to fire...""
"
Ni farikoloɲanajɛw jumɛn tun bɔra Olɛnpik bakuruba in na?,"The correct answer is **C: Baziboli**.

The passage states ""baziboli ni sɔfitiboli minnu bɔra 2005 Olɛnpik ɲɛnɛjɛw la"" which means that baziboli was removed from the Olympics.
"
Diyɛn Olɛnpik Kulu tun ye kala ta ni farikoloɲanajɛw jumɛn ye k’u ladon ɲanajɛw la?,"The correct answer is **C: Rigibi faraɲɔnka**.

The passage states that ""Rigibi kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnenyala mɔgɔ 15 Rugby, ani Golf de sugandila farikoloɲɛnajɛ duuru wɛrɛw cɛla walasa k'u sen don Olinpik Ɲɛnajɛw la."" This translates to ""15-player Rugby and Golf were chosen from among five other sports to participate in the Olympic Games."" While the passage mentions baziboli (baseball) and sɔfitiboli (softball), it states that they were removed from the Olympic Games in 2005, indicating they were not newly selected. It mentions ""tɛrɛntɛrɛnnan farikoloɲɛnajɛw"" (triathlon) as having applied to join the Olympics, but not as having been selected.
"
Arthur Guinness tun ye bolonɔ da singa St James Gate Brewery na ni y’a san joli ye?,"The correct answer is **D: 9000**

The passage states that Arthur Guinness leased the St James Gate Brewery for **9000** years.
"
Guinness bi dolari wari kasabi miliyari joli ladon san o san?,"The correct answer is **C: 14**.

The text states that Guinness generates ""wari dollari 14"" (American dollars 14) billion euros annually.
"
Jamana joli kɔnɔ Uniyɔn Erɔpɛnni jamanaw kɔnɔ sɛbɛnciyala H5N1 baanakisɛ yeli la?,"The correct answer is **C: Wolonwula** (Seven).

The passage explicitly states that France is the seventh country in the European Union to confirm cases of the H5N1 virus.
"
H5N1 baanakisɛ tun sɛbɛnciyala yɔrɔ laban jumɛn na?,"The correct answer is **A: Faransi**.

The passage states that the H5N1 virus was detected in a wild swan found near Lyon, in eastern France.
"

**C: Ka kɔn dugukoloyɛrɛyɛrɛ in ye** (After the earthquake)

The passage states that UN peacekeepers arrived in Haiti *after* the 2010 earthquake."
Nɔkɔw bɔli yɔrɔ jumɛn tun be se ka baanakisɛ jɛnsɛn?,"The passage states that the cholera outbreak originated near the UN camp, and that waste from the camp entered the Artibonite River. Therefore, the most likely place to find cholera bacteria would be near the **B: UN dagayɔrɔ (UN camp)** and **A: Artibonite Kɔɔ in (Artibonite River)**. However, based on the question and the prompt, only *one* answer may be chosen. The initial problem was near the UN camp which then affected the Artibonite River. Thus the best answer is **B: UN dagayɔrɔ**.
"
Irilandi marabaaw be ka mun labɛn ka kɛ?,"Based on the text:

*   The Irish lawyers (Irilandi marabaaw) are focused on the law concerning Wasabulon, wanting to amend it.
*   A lawyer said it's important for public health and the sense of justice that legal reforms happen quickly.
*   The Health Ministry showed concern over the short-term effects of relaxed drug regulations and the trust in medicine created since the laws changed.

This suggests they are trying to address issues that arose from relaxed drug regulations. Therefore, the most likely action is to take stricter laws on drug regulations.

**Correct Answer: B**"
Mun tun yamaruyali do Irilandi waati ni kɔnɔ?,"The answer is **A: Sonyali**.

The passage mentions ""fura tabaaw ka kuntaala surun hɛɛrɛ yamaruyali"" which translates to restrictions or bans on tobacco products. Tobacco products fall under the category of ""Sonyali.""
"
Dankarilikɛla jumɛn de ko be ka ɲɛɲini n’a ye damatɛmɛ wale?,"The correct answer is **A: Dankarilikɛli**.

The passage states that the investigation is about a ""cɛw dankarilikɛla mi tun ye damatɛmɛ wale kɛ ni o ni sekonidonko mafiyɛɲani tɛ kelen ye."" This translates to ""a male assailant who committed a related violent act and is not related to drug trafficking."" Therefore, the investigation is about the *assailant* (Dankarilikɛli) who committed the violent act.
"
"Nɔnabila yɛlɛma waati, dankarilikɛla tun ye mun kɛ?","The correct answer is **B: Ka ɲɛkɛn ni bɛn tamasiɲɛ ye**.

The passage states: ""yɛlɛma tun kɛla ka finifin ɲɛkɛn ni bɛn ni dusukun tamasiɲɛw ye ka yɛlɛma fitini kɛ """"o"""" la ka a kɛ """"e"""" ye."" This directly translates to the culprit was changing by creating the appearance of wrinkles and scars, and by subtly changing the ""o"" to an ""e."" So, the altering involved creating the impression of wrinkles and scars.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye,ninnu jumɛn tun jalaki ma kɛ Angilɛ karamɔgɔ Karno la?","Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **B: Kalanden dɔ jalali**

Here's why:

*   **A: Sɛbɛnni gasisigili sariyasɔsɔ:** The text explicitly states that he was initially accused of forgery but not convicted.
*   **C: Yɛrɛfɔkow sɛbɛn yamaruyabolenw:** The text says Kalan Tabolokura accused him of writing self-promoting things without permission.
*   **D: Nɛninni kumaw fɔli kalanso kɔnɔ:** The text mentions that he told funny jokes that were considered inappropriate for the classroom.

The only option NOT directly mentioned as an accusation against Karno in the text is ""jalali dɔnniw kalankɛ nɔbilaw la an'a tun be inafɔ kalandenw teri."". The final sentence only mentions a former student recalling him telling jokes and being ""like a friend"", but this does not reflect an accusation, just a past student's recollection.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔn tun ma minnɛ Rolando Mendoza fɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Turisiw**.

Here's why:

* The prompt states: ""Mũndũ ũmwe ũria warĩ mũthigari wa Filipino nianyitĩte atarii a Hong Kong mĩgwete...""
* The prompt is telling a story of a former Filipino police officer who took tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
* The Malinke word *turisiw* means tourists."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mɔgɔ minɛnnenw jumɛn ka bilali ma fɔ jona?","The correct answer is **A: Turisiw (Tourists)**.

The passage clearly states that the hostage takers were tourists from Hong Kong.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jun bi ka bɔlɔlɔw faraɲɔgɔn ka gɔrɔjinɛni ni gini furu sariya tali ko la Bresile Jamana kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **A: Mɔgɔmurutilew**.

The passage states: ""Mɔgɔmurutilew jigi be ka bɔlɔlɔ kan sɛbɛn miliyon 1.2 fara ɲɔgɔn kan ka ɲɛsin Jamana Wasabulo ma Nowanburukalo la."" This directly indicates that ""Mɔgɔmurutilew"" (the public/citizens) are expected to collect signatures related to the civil union law.
"
Mɔgɔmurutilew bin’u ka dɛmɛ di joni ma?,"The passage states: ""Mɔgɔmurutilew jigi be ka bɔlɔlɔ kan sɛbɛn miliyon 1.2 fara ɲɔgɔn kan ka ɲɛsin Jamana Wasabulo ma Nowanburukalo la.""

This means the petitioners are targeting the Brazil National Congress.

So the answer is C: Bresile Jamana Wasablon
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni Armand Versace lakalili ye, mun de kɛra tɛliya sani jama ka wale dɔ kɛ ka ɲɛsin waati cogoya ma?","The correct answer is **C: Fiɲɛbaw tun bɛ** (There were strong winds).

Here's why:

*   The passage clearly states ""fiɲɛ dɔ ye cili daminɛ"" (a wind started blowing) and then ""fiɲɛ ye kilomɛtɛrɛ 70 sɔrɔ waati kelen kɔnɔ"" (the wind reached 70 kilometers in one hour). This indicates a strong wind was the initial event before the hail, sandstorm, and the crowd's reaction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A daminɛna ni sanbɛlɛni ye** (It started with a sandstorm): The passage says the wind came *before* the sandstorm.
*   **B: Jirali tun bɛ ka taa sanga duuru kɔfɛ** (The demonstration was going to take place five hours later): This is not in the passage.
*   **D: Duden dɔ nɔn tununa a la** (A child lost their tooth): This is not mentioned in the passage."
"Versace fɛ, fiɲɛba baw daminɛna waati jumɛn?","Based on Armand's statement (P), the wind started at ""sanga duru ɲɛnajɛ kɔnɔ"" which translates to ""five o'clock in the evening"". Thus, the correct answer is:

**A: Sanga duuru kɔfɛ jirali daminɛnen** (After five o'clock in the evening)
"
"Ka kɔn Fred ɲɛ, fiyɛnkoloba joli de ɲɔgɔn tun ma kɛ 35°W kɔrɔn fɛ?","Based on the text:

The text explicitly states that Fred is ""kɔkɔjida fiyɛnkoloba saaban min lakodonnen do kɔrɔn fƐ ni 35°W hakƐ"" which translates to the ""third major hurricane recorded east of 35°W"". This implies there were two hurricanes before Fred that were east of 35°W. Therefore, before Fred, there were two (fila) hurricanes.

So the correct answer is:

**C: Fila**
"
"Ka Fred to Cape Verde jamana kɛrɛfɛ, a tun kundalen do fan jumɛn kan?","The correct answer is **A: Tilebin**.

The text states that Fiyɛnkoloba (Hurricane Fred) is located ""Cap Vert jamana tilebin bolo kan,"" which means ""on the western side of Cape Verde."" So the answer is Tilebin (western).
"
Nin jumɛn de ka telin ka tɛmɛ a fɔra minnu kɔ kan?,"The passage states that 802.11n is faster than ""waati tƐmƐlenw 802.11a, 802.11b ni 802.11g be ɲɔgontaa"". This translates to ""previous versions 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g."" Therefore, 802.11n is faster than 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g.

The question asks which one is *less* fast (which ones it surpasses).

Thus, the correct answer is **A: 802.11n**. Because the question asks what is faster and we already know that from reading through the text.
"
Mun de kan ka kɛ walasa 802.11 waati tɛmɛlenw kɛɲɛni 802.11b?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**A: Teliya kosɛbɛ (Very quickly)**

Here's why:

The passage states that 802.11n is *faster* than older standards like 802.11b.  So the main thing that 802.11n does relative to 802.11b is that it operates at a faster speed.
"
Ko joli de Olympic sanujɔnjɔntabaa tun b'u nɔ Angilɛfɔjamanaw ka Tulonkɛw la?,"The text says the Olympic gold medalist competed in the 100m and 200m events. That means he competed in **two** events.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Fila**
"
Munna Olympic sanujɔnjɔntabaa tun tɛ fura ta u ka dimi na?,"The correct answer is **C: A tun bɛ ka jɔrɔ, k’a bɛ seka kɔlɔlɔ lase a farikolo jogoya ma.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""a ma se k'a furaw ta munu b'a ka dimi mada, bawo jɛn kɛlen tɛ n'u ye tulonw na"" which translates to: ""He couldn't take the medicine to numb his pain, because it is not allowed in the games."" The reason provided is the rules of the games.

Let's consider why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dimi fosi tun tɛ a kan (He didn't have any pain):** This is incorrect because the passage explicitly says he had pain (""a ka dimi mada"").
*   **B: A tun b'a to a bɛ bana (He was letting himself be sick):** This doesn't align with the passage. The text focuses on pain and the rules, not on allowing himself to be sick.
*   **D: A tun ma yamaruya Angilɛfɔjamanaw ka Tulonkɛw (He did not authorize the English Games):** This doesn't make sense in the context. His participation in the games wouldn't depend on his approval.

Therefore, the only option that correctly explains why the Olympic gold medalist couldn't take pain medication is C."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de tun bɛ se ka nani ɲakamin ye dugukoloyɛrɛyɛrɛ kan?","The correct answer is **B: Rapɔri ka bɔ Icelandic Meteorological Biro**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Icelandic Meteorological Office reported swelling in the Hekla volcano over the past 48 hours. This directly suggests increased volcanic activity, which often precedes or accompanies earthquakes."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, waati jumɛn ɲɛ yɛlɛmani daminnɛ na?","The text states: ""Gĩthingithia kĩu gĩatũmire kũgie ũgarũrũku wa maũndũ kĩahanĩkĩte mweri ikũmi mweri-inĩ wa gatatũ mwena wa itherero wa volcano ya kĩrĩma kĩu.""

This translates to: ""The earthquake that caused the changes happened ten days into the third month in the eastern side of the volcano.""

The third month is March. Therefore, the earthquake happened on March 10th.

Therefore, the correct answer is: **C: Marisikalo tile 10** (March 10)
"
Nin kumasen jumɛn tɛ tiɲɛ ye Chandrayaan-1 ka kalo ciden kan?,"Correct answer: A: Kalobolisira min ye ciden fili, mɔgɔw tun bɛ a kɔnɔ

Explanation:

The original text says that the Moon Impact Probe (MIP) of Chandrayaan-1 *impacted* the Moon at a speed of over 1.5 kilometers per second. This means it was an unmanned probe. Options B, C, and D are also all potentially true of space probes. Therefore, the statement ""The orbiter that launched the probe contained people"" is incorrect.
"
Nin kumasen jumɛn de bɛ kalo ciden ɲɛfɔ tigitigi?,"Based on the text provided, here's the analysis and the correct answer:

*   **The text states:** ""Kalobolisira Chandrayaan-1 y'a ciden (MIP) fili ka taa kalopanpara gosi ka tɛmɛ ni kilomɛtɛrɛ1,5 ye segɔndi kɔnɔ (nɔngɔnɲɛ 3000 waati kelen kɔnɔ), ni ka sɔrɔ ka taa i fili kalocɛmancɛ worodugu fɛ""

Let's look at the options:

*   **A: A jiginna kalocɛmancɛ kɔkɔdugu fɛ (It landed in the South Pole of the Moon):** The text states that it crashed ""ka taa i fili kalocɛmancɛ worodugu fɛ"" (and then crashed near the North Pole of the Moon), so this is wrong.

*   **B: A ka filili cuni kɛra ka ɲɛ (Its crash was well planned):** The text mentions that it crashed, but it doesn't specify whether this was planned or accidental.

*   **C: A tun filila ni kalobolisira mɔgɔ man ye (It crashed without people on board):** The passage clearly states that the MIP was deployed from the Chandrayaan-1 orbiter (""Kalobolisira Chandrayaan-1 y'a ciden (MIP) fili ka taa...""). Thus it was not carrying humans.

*   **D: A tun bɛka fɛn nafama fila ta (It was carrying two important things):** While the passage mentions that ""kalosiraciden fana ye Ɛndu jamana jɔnjɔnlahala ta, min ɲɛkɛnna kɛrɛ bɛɛ fɛ"", it's not explicit if it carried any important ""fɛn nafama fila"".

**Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the text is C: A tun filila ni kalobolisira mɔgɔ man ye (It crashed without people on board)**.
"
"Ka da tɛmɛsira in kan, bana kɔlɔsilikɛ fɛɛrɛ ninnu jumɛn de labanna ka sigi senkan ?","Based on the passage, all the options were implemented:

*   **A: Bagajiw:** ""fɛnɛ ka bagaji fiyɛ"" - spraying pesticides
*   **B: Lɛ minɛnaw:** ""ka mɔgɔw bila ka lɛw minɛ yɔrɔw la yɔrɔ minw na baanakisɛ caarila kosɛbɛ"" - deploying people to collect larvae in highly infected areas.
*   **C: Encephalitis-bolocifura:** ""Encephalitis-bolocifura miliyon caman fɛnɛ layidu tala maraɲɛmɔgɔw fɛ"" - millions of encephalitis vaccines were promised by officials.
*   **D: Sosokɔnɔnjɔw:** ""ka sosokɔnɔnjɔ waa caman dilan"" - making thousands of mosquito nets.

Therefore, the most comprehensive answer is to list all of them, but since there's no ""all of the above"" option, we must choose the most impactful ones. The passage emphasizes the deployment of people to collect larvae and the distribution of mosquito nets as key strategies, but it also highlights the encephalitis vaccination efforts.

**Therefore, the best answer is C and D.**

However, if I had to choose only ONE option, the answer should be **C: Encephalitis-bolocifura**, because the passage highlights the millions of vaccines promised by officials. It sounds like the most significant strategy.
"
Banakisɛ in bɛ yɛlɛma adamaden na cogodi?,"The correct answer is **A: Sosow**.

The passage states: ""Baana nin bɛ lɛw dɛ la, min tilala tuguni ka yɛlɛma mɔgɔw la sosow fɛ."" This translates to ""This disease is in the mouths of pigs, which is then spread to humans by mosquitoes.""
"
Kumansen filana ka dɛsɛ bɛ seka nani jabi jumɛ ye?,"The correct answer is **D: Gɔrijigɛni ni gin jɛw balili**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the second part of the overturned law involved ""gɔrijigɛni ni gin jɛ balili"" (prohibition of marijuana and gin).
* The question asks what the loss of the second part of the law refers to.
* Therefore, the answer is the prohibition of marijuana and gin.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kumasen filanan tun bɔra a la waati jumɛn?","The correct answer is **A: Wasabulon ka seson kɔnɔna**.

The passage states: ""Yɛlɛma dɔ kɛra ni sariyatali tuma in na min kumasen filanan in bɔra ala fɔlɔfɔlɔla Wasabulon so kelen fɛ..."" which translates to: ""A change happened during the legal period where the second phrase was removed initially from one Wasabulon assembly..."" ""Legal period"" and ""assembly"" points to the *seson* (session).
"
“Panama Papers” tun bɔra ka fɔ jɔn ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Mossack Fonseca ka foro**.

The passage clearly states that the ""Panama Papers"" were a leak of documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔn Britanikiw ka kunafonigafe ka kunafoni b'a kofɔ ni a tun bɛ ka sɔrɔcakɛda mara minnu dɛlilen don ka nafolow dogo?","The passage states: ""Britanikiw ka kunafonigafƐ The Guardian ye a do maw kun na ko Deutsche warimaraso tun be a janto cakƐda guwansan 1200 tila sabanan na minw tun talen do ni ka nin ko in kƐli kan ma.""

The passage implies that Deutsche Bank was involved in managing shell companies used to hide assets, not the entities listed in the answer options. Therefore, none of the provided options directly address the question based on the passage. However, since the passage mentions Deutsche Bank was involved in managing shell companies and not the options provided, it is likely the question is poorly phrased or intended to test an inference about who benefits from such practices. It is important to note that the provided options do not have any clear connections to the passage.

Looking at the options, none seem to directly fit as the entities mentioned by the British newspaper ""The Guardian"" as directly involved.

However, because the question asks for what The Guardian was reporting in reference to the passage, it appears no answer is possible.
Because the question is explicitly asking what the passage says, and nothing is mentioned as a directly relevant answer in the provided options, it is unclear what answer is meant to be chosen.
Based on this reading, it is impossible to select the correct answer because none of them accurately represent what is presented in the text.
"
Ni pankuru kasara jumɛn de kɛra kasara bɛɛ juguman ye?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Pankuru kasara Mashhad**.

The text states: ""Salo Iran ka pankurun kasaraw bɛɛ la juguman kɛra kabini san caman tuma minna taama pankurunni dɔ kun dalen Arameni kan binna k'a kunna mɔgɔ 168 faga."" Since Mashhad is the only location in the answer choices, the correct answer must be **D**.
"
Ni jumɛn tɛ seka kɛ kun ye sanfɛsira kasara caman min bɛ kɛ Iran?,"The correct answer is **D: Pankurukalan fanga dɔgɔyali** (Decreased effectiveness of air defenses).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Iranian air defenses are old and not properly maintained. This directly implies a weakening or decreased effectiveness.
*   Other options are less relevant to this particular question

"
Nin fɛnw jumɛn kelen tun tɛ Iraki Kalan Jɛkulu ka gafe kɔnɔ?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **B: Lase dɔ min b’a fɔ ko yɛlɛma dɔw be se ka binkanni cayali bali Iraki kɔnɔ**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Mara tabolo lagosili:** The passage explicitly states, ""Gafe in be lagosili ba kɛ ɲɛnmɔgow ka ni waati mara taabolo fan bɛɛ la"".

*   **C: Laɲiniw walasa ka Iraki jamana dancɛw lakana:** The passage mentions ""A ka laɲini 78 cɛla fɔlɔ ye ka jamanaw ni ɲɔgɔcɛ hakilina kura dɔ ka kan ka ta yani ni san in ka ban walasa ka Iraki jamana dancɛw lakana ka bɔ ladorokoli juguw la.""

*   **D: Sankɔrɔta dɔ ka ɲɛsin Lamerikɛn jamana ka fɔkabɛn ma:** The passage indicates, ""Gafe in be dayɛlɛ ni sankɔrɔta ye k'a ɲinsin foroba baro ma ani fɔkabɛn Lameriki jamann kɔnɔ minnu be talikɛ mara taabolow la Azi bangu kɔrɔfɛ jamanaw la.""

While the passage discusses the possibility of violence and conflict in Iraq, it does *not* claim that specific changes can prevent escalating violence. It only mentions that the book warns it is impossible to write something correctly because the country is full of the possibility of violence, conflict, or increasing terror. Therefore, option B is not something directly found within the book."
Lraki Kalan Jɛkulu ma nin fɛnw juman kelen laɲini?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka jamanaw ni ɲɔgɔncɛ hakilina kura dɔ ta**.

The passage states: ""A ka laɲini 78 cɛla fɔlɔ ye ka jamanaw ni ɲɔgɔcɛ hakilina kura dɔ ka kan ka ta yani ni san in ka ban walasa ka Iraki jamana dancɛw lakana..."" which translates to ""Its first of 78 goals is to adopt a new international understanding before the end of the year in order to protect Iraq's borders...""

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: Ko sɛnbɛntiya ka kɛ ka fo ko Iraki binkanni cayali ka lajɔ**: The passage mentions that the group warns against writing that stability prevails in Iraq due to conflict, increased attacks, or stopping tribal skirmishes. While it implies stopping the increase of attacks, it's not the direct *goal* the passage highlights.
*   **B: Tasira yɛlɛmali jona-jona**: The passage mentions ""taabolo yɛlɛmali laɲini kƐ tuma ni tuma jona-jona"" which means constantly trying to change policies quickly. While this is *an* activity of the group, it is not highlighted as their first goal.
*   **C: Foroba baro kɛli**: The passage mentions opening with an overview of public discourse and dialogue in the US about failing governance models. While it is present in the passage, it is not the main purpose."
"Lakanatigilamaw ka fɔ la, jɔni tun jatelen do nafɔ Provenzano demɛ bolo dɔ?","The correct answer is **B: La Piccolo**.

The passage states: ""Lakanatigilamɔgɔw ko Lo Piccolo bolo ka jan bari a kun kɛra Provenzan dɛmɛ bolo dɔ ye..."" which translates to ""Investigators say Lo Piccolo's hand is long because he became Provenzano's right-hand man...""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ kunafoni fun ye, mun kɛra Falcone ka saya sababu ye?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: A fagara Riina ka kɛlɛ kolokolen sen fɛ.**

The passage states that Falcone (and Borsellino) were killed during Riina's ""strategic"" war that targeted the state after the 1992 Mafia attacks.
"
Ni fɛnw jumɛn kele te Hitoshi Saito’s ka jɔjɔn talenw dɔ ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Diɲɛ ŋana siɲɛ fila**.

The passage states Hitoshi Saito was an Olympic gold medalist twice, head of the All-Japan Judo Training Group, and a famous Judo player. It does *not* say he was a world champion twice.
"
Iwasaki sera ka yɛrɛ tila furula saratikandili yɔrɔ juman?,"Based on the provided text, Iwasaki escaped from a wedding in **Nepali**.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Nepali**.
"
Jɔni dara Iwasaki kan?,"The correct answer is **C: Wulu dɔ**

The passage states ""wulufaatɔ dɔ dara a kan Tibet"" which translates to ""a wolf attacked him in Tibet"".
"
Alonso ka ɲɔgɔndan labanna waati juman?,"Let's break down the passage and the question:

*   **P tells us:**
    *   Fisichella's car broke down near the end of the race.
    *   Alonso was ahead for most of the race.
    *   Alonso had a tire problem.
    *   Schumacher had a car problem after fighting during the race.

*   **Q asks:** When did Alonso's race end?

Based on P, Alonso's tire problem was *why* he had to retire (""senbɔ aka lafiyɛnbɔjɔli kɔ, o sabu kakan ka kɛ kini ɲɛfɛ sen dɔnjuguya ye""). It implies that the tire issue led to the end of his race.

Let's look at the answer choices:

*   **A: Schumacher ka kini ɲɛfɛsen tiɲɛni kɔfɛ (After Schumacher's front tire damage)** - The passage says Schumacher's damage happened *after* Alonso's tire problem. So this is incorrect.
*   **B: Fisichella ka mɔbili tilala a la (Fisichella's car broke down)** - The passage mentions Fisichella's breakdown, but does not say it caused Alonso's problems, so this is incorrect.
*   **C: Schumacher kɛlen kɔ ka senbɔ ɲɔgɔndan na (After Schumacher entered the race)** - This is incorrect because Schumacher didn't just ""enter"" the race. He had his own issue and left after Alonso.
*   **D: Sani a ka kɛ ɲɛfɛ (Before he was ahead)** - Alonso *was* ahead for most of the race. His retirement did not cause him to be ahead, his tire issue did. So, the answer is **incorrect**.

The passage focuses on the end of the race and the reasons each driver had issues/ended their race. It states: ""Alonso ... y'a senbɔ aka lafiyɛnbɔjɔli kɔ, o sabu kakan ka kɛ kini ɲɛfɛ sen dɔnjuguya ye."" Since there is no answer that clearly indicates the answer to the question is Alonso's tire issue, this answer is not available. Since the answers are not accurate to the question in reference to the original passage, the best answer to choose is **D: Sani a ka kɛ ɲɛfɛ (Before he was ahead)**.

**Therefore, the best answer is D.**"
Mun kɛra sababu ye Schumacher y’a senbɔ ɲɔgɔndan jona?,"The correct answer is **D: Mɔbili jɔlan tiɲɛni** (Mɔbili jɔlan tiɲɛni = Engine failure).

The passage states: ""Michael Schumacher tilala aka ɲɔgɔndan na sɔɔni Alonso kɔfɛ, k'a sabu kɛ **mɔbili jɔlan ciyɛnni** ye kɛlɛ caman senfɛ ɲɔgɔndan in na."" which translates to ""Michael Schumacher retired from the race shortly after Alonso, his reason being **engine failure** due to many battles during the race.""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsiran in ye, jɔn ka baara ye ka minɛlenw ka musaka sigi senka?","The correct answer is **D: Kiiritigɛla (Judge)**.

The text states ""Kiiritigɛla in be musaga dɔ sigi sen kan, ni jɛn kɛr'a ma, w'a be ɲaginliw sɛbɛntiya minɛlikɛla ɲɛmɔgɔ fɛ."" This translates to ""The judge sets a bail amount, if applicable, and documents the charges with the arresting officer.""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni waati kunkuruni minɛli yamaruya ye mun kofɔlen be tɛmɛsiran in kɔnɔ, minɛlenw yamaruyalen be ka mun sɔrɔ walasa u ka se ka datugun nɛgɛ kaɲɛ 24 tɛmɛnen kɔ?","The correct answer is **D: Lamɛli**

The passage states: ""...mɔgɔw labila minnu datugulendon a ka ciya min nɛgɛ kanɲɛ 24 ye u ka minɛli kɔfɛ n'u ma lamɛ kiiritigɛba dɔ fɛ"" which translates to ""...release people who are detained for up to 24 hours after their arrest if they do not appear before a judge."" Lamɛli means ""appearance"" or ""hearing"". So, those arrested must have a hearing to avoid detention for up to 24 hours.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kun jumɛn kelen de ma ta ka kɛ walawali ye kalafili takofilanan dabilalila?","The correct answer is **B: Sariyakolo sɔsɔli**.

Here's why:

* **P:** ""Ni be sɛbɛn fɔlɔw sɔsɔ, minnu y'a fɔ ko kalafili takofilana in dabilali tun bena kɛ sariyakolo in juguya la."" This directly translates to ""They (the lasigidenw) opposed previous writings that said closing the takofilana jail would be bad for the *sariyakolo*."" *Sariyakolo* in Bambara can refer to society or law.

The other options are mentioned in the text as reasons *for* closing the jail, not as something that was *not* a reason.
"
Munna kalafili takofilanan tun laban kɛra manamana ye lasigidenw fɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Siriyakolo in tun dibidibifɛn ne do**.

The passage states: ""Lasigidenw y'a fɔ k'u tun ye dibidibifɛn jɔnjɔn sɔrɔ Afuganisitan siriyakolo la walasa ka kalafili takofilana in kɛ manamana ye."" This translates to: ""The residents said they found important ingredients in Afghanistan's environment/nature to make the opium poppy planting less effective."" Therefore, the residents made the opium poppy planting less effective because they found important ingredients in Afghanistan's nature.
"
Jɔnni bɛ kirikow sigi senkan FATA ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Politikimɔgɔw**.

The passage states: ""Pakistan jamanakuntigi ye """"Politikimɔgɔw"""" ta ka FATA kow ɲɛnabɔ... O politikimɔgɔw kɛra sababu ye ka marabulon ni kiri sigi senkan min latikɛra ni Article 247 ye Pakistan Sariyagafeba kɔnɔ.""

This clearly indicates that the ""Politikimɔgɔw"" (politicians) are responsible for establishing the laws and judicial system related to FATA.
"
Ninnu kumasenw jumɛn tɛ tiɲɛ ye FATA “Politikimɔgɔw” kan?,"Let's break down the passage and the options:

* **Passage Summary:** Pakistan gained independence from Great Britain in 1947. The Pakistani President appointed ""Politikimɔgɔw"" (Politicians) to manage FATA (Federally Administered Tribal Areas). These ""Politikimɔgɔw"" established a system of governance and justice that was influenced by Article 247 of the Pakistani Constitution.

Now, let's analyze each option:

* **A: U bɛ kirikow sigi senkan (They establish courts):** The passage states they established a system of governance and *justice*, implying they were involved in creating or overseeing the judicial system.  This aligns with the passage.

* **B: U sugandira Pakistan jamanakuntigi fɛ (They are chosen by the Pakistani President):** The passage *explicitly* says the President appointed them. This aligns with the passage.

* **C: U sɔnna Pakistan siriyakolo ma (They agreed to Pakistan's law):** The passage states that the justice system created by these politicians latigɛra ni Article 247 ye Pakistan Sariyagafeba kɔnɔ, suggesting they agreed and abide with Pakistan Law. This aligns with the passage.

* **D: U ka mara dafalen bɛ yɔrɔw dɔw kan (Their power is absolute in some areas):** The passage mentions, ""min ka mara bɛ yɔrɔw tilan bɛɛ kan,"" suggesting they have authority and influence over all parts of the FATA. Thus, this aligns with the passage.

Looking again, the question asks which is ""not true."" If the question really meant that u ka mara dafalen bɛ yɔrɔw dɔw kan (Their power is absolute in some areas), if the politicians' power is not ""absolute,"" then that would be untrue. Since the passage says, ""min ka mara bɛ yɔrɔw tilan bɛɛ kan"", indicating a balanced and inclusive governance across all parts of the FATA, this implies that their power is not ""absolute"" but rather distributed or applied evenly. Thus, D is the best answer.

**Therefore, the correct answer is D: U ka mara dafalen bɛ yɔrɔw dɔw kan**
"
Emma Stone tun sugandira jɔnjɔn jumɛn na?,"The correct answer is **C: Filimu Bɔlamusoma bɛɛ la Ɲuman**.

The prompt states that ""Gosling ni Stone sugandira ka kɛ filimu bɔlacƐman ani musoma ɲɔgɔn nɔfɛ,"" which translates to ""Gosling and Stone were nominated for best actor and actress respectively.""
"
Jɔnjɔn jumɛn tun ye filimu ye na tun ma sugandi?,"The correct answer is **A: Filimu bɛɛ la Ɲuman**.

The passage states that the movie was nominated in several categories, including ""filimu bɛɛ la ɲuman"" which translates to ""Best Picture"" or ""Best Film.""
"
Ninnu jumɛn de tora baara la dugukoloyɛrɛyɛrɛ kɔfɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Pankurunjigikɛnɛ min bɛ Ishikawa**.

Here's why:

*   **Pankurunjigikɛnɛ min bɛ Ishikawa:** The passage states that the ""pankurunjigikɛnɛ Noto min bɛ Ishikawa mara la datuguni tora,"" meaning it *remained closed/suspended*. This implies it was not in operation.

*   **A: Yeelenjibarakalamaw bɛɛ la Hokuriku ka Shika yeelendibon la:** The passage specifically states that ""a ka yeelendibon Shika ka 3yeelenjibarakalama1 ani 2 tun fagara,"" meaning units 1 and 2 were shut down. So, *not* all units were in operation.

*   **C: Nɛgɛsiracakɛda bɛɛ:** The passage mentions that the ""nɛgɛsiracakɛda y'a ka baara jɔ sigidakofɔniw na,"" meaning that they stopped their services. This implies that the nɛgɛsiracakɛda bɛɛ were *not* in operation.

*   **D: Yeelendibon min bɛ Niigata:** The passage states that ""NHK fɛnɛ ye kunafonidi kɛ ko yeelendiso Kashiwazaki Kariwa min sigini do Niigata mara kɔnɔ tun bɛ baara kɛra a cogo la,"" meaning that the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant in Niigata was operating ""a cogo la"", this implies a partial but not full operation. Thus it was *not* in full operation.

Therefore, only the Pankurunjigikɛnɛ min bɛ Ishikawa had the information indicating it was not in operation post-earthquake."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn de tora halaki kɔfɛ ka sabu kɛ dugukoloyɛrɛyɛrɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Sira dɔw (Some roads)**.

The passage specifically states ""Sira dɔw halakira"" (Some roads were destroyed). While the other options are mentioned in the passage, they aren't directly stated as being *destroyed* by the earthquake.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu ko jumɛn kuma ma fɔ sɛbɛn in kɔnɔ?","The passage explicitly mentions the following:

*   **B: San 1967 kɛlɛ kun:** The passage starts by saying the document will focus on boundary issues relating to Palestine with reference to the 1967 borders.
*   **C: Kɛlɛbolo kɛli kulufurancɛ:** The passage speaks about Israel's military presence in the Jordan Valley.
*   **A: Isirayɛli jamana ka siniɲɛsigin:** The passage mentions that issues arrived relating to the difficult Israeli settlement.

The passage talks about border issues but not disagreement upon borders.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Fɔnkɔɲɔgɔn yali dancɛw la**.
"
Ninnu kelen jumɛn tɛ Palɛstini ka laɲini dɔ kelen ye?,"The correct answer is **D: Kɛlɛbolo kɛlila Zɔrɔdani Kulufurancɛ in na san duuru kɔnɔ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Israel wants a military presence in the Jordan Valley for 10 years, and the PA (Palestinian Authority) agrees to *withdraw* its forces from the area within 5 years *after* an agreement is reached.

* **Option D states:** Military battles in the Jordan Valley in 5 years.

Therefore, Option D contradicts the passage. The passage says the PA agrees to *withdraw* after 5 years, not fight for 5 years.
"
Ma ye sariya kalankɛ jamana jumɛn na?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **A: United States of America**.

The passage states that Ma attended law school in New York, which is in the United States of America.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jamana jumɛn de tun ye Ma lafasa k’a dɛmɛ kalafili sebaya sɔrɔli la?","Based on the passage, Ma was a **Hong Kong** resident who also attended university in New York. The passage mentions that Hsieh suggested Ma might flee the country during difficulties. The last sentence indicates Ma had a talent for pleasing crowds who seem to promote ties between **China** and other countries.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Sini** (China) because Ma's talent was appealing to crowds that supported ties *with* China.
"
"Inafɔ a fɔn bɛ tɛmɛsira in nan, jɔnni tun ye Carolyn Wilson ka baara kɛ sani ka dugu bila?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

The passage states ""aamu ko OHA Carolyn Wilson tun ye uka basikili wari bilanlen kƐrƐfƐ de suɲa wa a tun ye dugu bila."" This directly indicates Carolyn Wilson worked for the OHA before leaving the city.
"
"Ni ɲɔgɔndan naani min bɛ na kɛ siɲɛn wɛrɛ, jɔnni de bɛ mɔbilibolilaw ka ɲɔgɔndandangele jɔyɔrɔ naani na?","Let's break down the information provided and see who's likely in 4th place:

*   **Keselowski:** 1st place, 2,250 points
*   **Johnson:** 2nd place, 2,243 points
*   **Hamlin:** 3rd place, points unknown but *10 points ahead of Bowyer*
*   **Kahne:** 5th place, 2,220 points
*   **Truex, Jr.:** 6th place, 2,207 points
*   **Bowyer:** 5 points behind Hamlin. This means Hamlin has more than 2220 points as Kahne is in 5th position with 2220 points, and Hamlin is 3rd. Therefore, Bowyer is in 4th.

Therefore, the answer is **D: Bowyer**."
"Ɲogɔndan min kofɔlen do tɛmɛsira in nan, Kahne ka kuru ye joli ye ni Mɔbilibolilaw ka Ɲɔgɔndandangele na?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The passage states that Kahne finished fifth with 2,220 points.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ni y'a siɲɛn joli ye mɔgɔw ka seereya nɛgɛkuru binni na min laban yɛlɛmana ka kɛ Marisi kan minɛn yɛrɛyɛrɛw ye?","The correct answer is **C: Siɲɛn tan ni duuru**.

The passage states ""O fara ninnu cɛman, tanniduuru dɔrɔn lakodɔnna ka  bɔ nɛgɛ sanji jigilenw la Zuwe kalo tɛmɛnnen in."" This translates to ""Apart from these many, only fifteen have been identified from the recent meteorite showers in July.""
"
"Inafɔ a fɔlendo ni tɛmɛsira in na, mun de ye tiɲɛ fara ninnu na minnu sɛgɛsɛgɛra ka kɛ marisi minɛlakikaw ye?","The correct answer is **D: U ɲɔgɔnna 34**.

The passage states: ""Nɛgɛkuru kodɔnlen 24,000 minnu binna dugukolo kan, 34 dɔrɔn sɛgɛsɛgɛra ka kɛ Marisi minɛlakikaw ye"" which translates to ""Of the 24,000 meteorites that have fallen to earth, only 34 have been analyzed and confirmed to be Martian meteorites."" This directly supports option D.
"
Waati jumɛn Schumacher taara baarasɛgɛlafiyɛnbɔ la?,"The correct answer is **B: Ɲɔgɔndan jɔnjɔn ta siɲɛn wolowila tɛmɛn ne**.

The text states ""Schumacher min be baarasɛgɛlafiyɛnbɔ la kabini san 2006, a kɛlen kɔ ka Formula 1 ɲɔgɔndan jɔnjɔn ta siɲɛn wolowila"". This means Schumacher went into retirement after winning the Formula 1 championship seven times, starting his retirement in 2006. Option B captures this meaning.
"
Waati jumɛn Massa tun bana na?,"The correct answer is **A: Jɔnjɔn Ba tuma** (Jɔnjɔn Ba time).

The passage states that Massa was injured ""san 2009 Hɔngiri Jɔnjɔn Ba la"" which translates to ""at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix"".  Therefore, Massa was injured during a Grand Prix.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ko in dilanni bina se ka fɛn kɛ AOL cokodi?","The correct answer is **C: AOL labaaralaw hakɛ bina fadenya Yahoo ni Microsoft labaaralaw hakɛ la**.

The passage states that ""Microsoft cakɛdaw dorogoniw bɛ na fadenya saman ni AOL sanikɛlaw ye,"" which translates to ""Microsoft shares will become common with AOL shareholders.""  This means AOL shareholders will gain shares of Yahoo and Microsoft. Therefore, the overall number of employees or shares related to AOL will become part of Yahoo and Microsoft.
"
Ninnu jumɛn de tun laban bi se ka na ni dilanni kura ye?,"The correct answer is **C: AOL ka yɛrɛ mabila ka taa ɲɛ feere la a yɛrɛ tɔgɔla**

Here's why:

* **P** states that AOL is splitting from its internet business to become its own independent company, which led to job losses.
* **Q** asks which of the options is the reason for the restructuring.

The only answer that accurately reflects the information in **P** is **C**, which states that AOL is trying to sell its independent company. The sale/split is the underlying cause of the job losses.
"
Mɔgɔ joli sara ni binkanni wale in na minnu tun tɛ polosiw?,"Let's break down the information to find the answer.

*   **Total killed:** 2 police officers
*   **Total injured:** 19 people
*   **Injured police officers:** 10

This means that 19 people were injured and 10 of those were police officers. Therefore, 19 - 10 = 9 civilians were injured.  The question asks how many *died* who weren't police officers. The text says that **two police officers died** and says nothing about any civilians dying. Therefore, the number of non-police deaths is 0.

The correct answer is **C: 0**
"
Jɔnni ye sikanna mɔgɔ minnu jira ni binkanni wale in na?,"The correct answer is **A: Polosiw**.

The passage states: ""Polosiw ye a jira ka fɔ ka olu sikalenbƐ Daesh (ISIL) ka kƐlƐcƐ dɔ la min nɔminƐlendo binkanni wale in na.""  This translates to ""The police indicated that they suspected a Daesh (ISIL) militant was behind the attack.""
"
"Ka da Florida jɔyɔrɔ ka I n'a fɔ sarabacɛjamana, mun de tun dira Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **C: Jamana cidenw bɛɛ** (All the state's delegates).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I n'a fɔ sarabacɛjamana, Florida y'a ciden taniduuruw bɛɛ di Romney ma"" which translates to: ""As a winner-take-all state, Florida awarded all its delegates to Romney"". So Romney received all of Florida's delegates.

A is incorrect because Newt Gingrich received 32 percent.
B is not entirely correct. While winning the delegates helped Romney become the Republican frontrunner, the direct award was the delegates themselves.
D is incorrect because 46% was the percent of the vote.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kɛmɛkɛmɛ sarada kalatasɛbɛn joli de tun sɔrɔ la Gingrich fɛ jamanakuntigikalatafɔlɔ la?","The correct answer is **B: Kɛmɛkɛmɛ sarada 32**.

The passage states: ""Etats Unis jamanakuntigiso'kumalaserakɔrɔ Newt Gingrich ye jɔyɔrɔ filanan sɔrɔ ni 32 ye kɛmɛkɛmɛ sarada."" This directly translates to Newt Gingrich receiving 32 percent of the vote.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔnni tun ma kalata ɲɔgɔndan kɛ tugun kalataɲɛnɛbɔbagaw ka jabi kɔfɛ?","Let's analyze the text:

*   **Perry:** The text says Perry considered returning to Texas to assess the results and decide if he had a future in the race, but then decided to stay in the race.
*   **Bachmann:** The text says Bachmann withdrew from the race.
*   **Gingrich:** The text does not state whether he withdraws.
*   **Romney:** The text does not state whether he withdraws.

Based on this, Bachmann is the only one who is explicitly stated to have withdrawn from the race after the results.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Bachmann**
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔnni de tun kuma kɔsɔbɛ kalata cɛbɔ wɛrɛ ka kalataɲɛnɛbɔbagaw ka jabi kɔfɛ?","The correct answer is **D: Perry**.

The passage states that Perry said he would ""go back to Texas to assess the results of the Iowa caucuses, to determine if there is a path forward for me in this race"". This indicates he would be carefully considering the results (kalataɲɛnɛbɔbagaw ka jabi) before making a decision. While Gingrich spoke about the results as well, Perry specifically mentioned assessing them.
"
Yɔrɔ jumɛn kelen de tun kɛnɛ tun dabɔra jabɔ yɔrɔ kama sani san 2015?,"The passage states:

*   ""Ko in daminɛw la, kɛnɛ tun dabɔra kumaso Toginet ka waatijanbɔlɔlɔsirabarani dɔrɔn kanma"" (In the beginning of the project, the network was only created on the Toginet computer).
*   ""San 2005 laban na, Toginet ye kumaso filana dɔ sigi n'o ye Astronet ye"" (At the end of 2005, Toginet created a second computer network, which was Astronet).

The question asks where the network was created *before* 2015. Since the passage says the network was originally only on the Toginet computer, and Astronet was created in 2005, the correct answer is Toginet Kumaso.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: TogiNet Kumaso**
"
Kumaso sira bi jabɔ ɲɛfɔ inafɔ ka dankari ya suguya jumɛn sɔrɔ?,"The answer is **B: Adamadenya la**.

The passage explicitly states ""...yokorofɔlisenkura ye min bɛ dankari kɛ **adamadenya la**!"". This directly connects the project with the concept of humanity.
"
David Headley tun ye mun de fara ɲɔgɔn ka min labanna ka kɛ dɛmɛn ye binkanniikɛla marifatigi kulu ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Kunnafoni**.

The passage states ""David Headley ka lakɔlɔsili ni **kunnafoni** faraɲɔgɔnkan tunye dɛmɛn kɛ walasa ka ni kɛlɛwale in kɛ..."". This translates to ""David Headley's surveillance and **information** sharing helped to carry out this attack..."". Therefore, information sharing is what David Headley contributed.
"
Bolimafɛn jumɛn de tun marifatigi kulu bolo ka ta Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Jikurun** (Boat).

The passage states that the attackers arrived by sea (jikurun).
"
Kumasen jumɛn de bi Nadal ni Raonic ka ɲɔgɔnsɔrɔla Brisbane Open ka maci jabi jira tigitigi min kofɔra ni tɛmɛsira in na?,"The correct answer is **C: Nadal ye sebaya sɔrɔ Raonic ka**.

The passage states: ""Kɔsadaninna a ma sebaya sɔrɔ ani Raonic ka ɲɔgɔnsɔrɔla Brisbane Open la"" which translates to ""Nadal won against Raonic at the Brisbane Open"".
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔyɔrɔ jumɛn de tun bɛ Nadal ni Raonic ka maci la taako fɔlɔ kɔfɛ?","The correct answer is **B: Nadal ye kuru 76 sɔrɔ**.

The passage states: ""Nadal ye  a kunfa ni kuru 88%  macila ni sebaya kuru 76  sɔrɔli ye taako fɔlɔ la"" (Nadal converted 88% of his first serves and won 76% of his first serve points).
"

The paragraph mentions that the researchers are improving the Spanish, Italian, and Korean languages. It does not mention Japanese.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, yɔrɔ jumɛn tɛna Naked News ka kunnafoni sɔrɔ?","The correct answer is **A: Telefɔniw**.

The passage mentions kunafonicarisirakura saba including jabarani (newspapers). It does not state that telefɔniw will be a news source, but it does mention Jabarani so that can't be the correct answer. 
"
Ɲɔgɔndannikɛla joli tun ma Silalɔmiba laban?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The passage states: ""jikurubolikɛla 45 a kuuru 117 la Silalɔmi Ba in na bina jɔyɔrɔko la ni boli in na,"" which translates to ""45 runners out of 117 in the slalom failed to finish the race.""
"
Ninnu kumasenw jumɛn bi ɲɔgɔdan ninnu Ɲɔgɔndan la jabi tigitigi jira?,"The correct answer is **C: Jikurubolikɛla caman y’a kuncɛ Silalɔmiba la ka tɛmɛn Silalɔmi ka**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that in Silalɔmi, 36 competitors responded out of 116.
*   The passage states that in Silalɔmiba, 45 competitors failed to finish out of 117. This means that 117 - 45 = 72 *did* finish.

72 finishers in Silalɔmiba is more than 36 finishers in Silalɔmi, so more people completed Silalɔmiba than Silalɔmi.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ɲɔgɔndan filana na, Carpanedo y’a kuncɛ jikurubolikɛla dɔ ɲɛ ka bɔ Hɔngiri** This is incorrect. Carpanedo was beaten by a Hungarian.
*   **B: Jikurubolikɛla 45 ma se ka boli kuncɛ ni Silalɔmiba in na** This is incorrect. While 45 failed to finish, this doesn't mean *all* competitors failed to finish.
*   **D: Carpenado y’a kuncɛ tan na Silalɔmi na** This is incorrect. Carpenado finished tenth in Silalomi**ba**, not Silalomi."
NBA ya laɲinni ka ninnu jumɛn kelen basikɛtikɛnɛ jɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: Basikɛti waati**.

The passage states that the NBA suspended its basketball **season** (basikɛtikɛnɛ) due to COVID-19. The other options are related to the reason *why* the season was suspended, but the question asks what the NBA suspended.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de nana ni jɔɔrɔ ye NBA la ka ɲɛsin baanakisɛ in ma?","The correct answer is **D: Baanakisɛ tun yera Atah Jazz fɔlikɛra dɔ la** (The disease was found in a Utah Jazz player).

The passage states that the NBA suspended the season because of COVID-19 concerns and that this happened after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for COVID-19. This makes option D the most accurate and direct answer to the question.
"
Jɔnni ye sebayasɔrɔli bii do Washington faabaw ye balontanna ka ta Atlanta Thrashers juguyara?,"The correct answer is **D: Alex Ovechkin**.

The passage states ""Bii balontanna tɔgɔtigiya ye **Alex Ovechkin** de ye ka bɔ Washington faabaw kɔnɔ. A ye bi 2 do ni ka dƐmƐdo ko 2 ni balon diili ye sen min fƐ 5-3 sebaaya sɔrɔla Athlata Thrashers kan Whasington."" which translates to ""The scoring star was **Alex Ovechkin** of the Washington Capitals. He scored 2 goals and had 2 assists in the 5-3 victory over the Atlanta Thrashers"".
"
Jɔnni y’a ka celu 60nan do Faabaw ka balonta ka ta Atlanta Thrashers juguyara?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The passage states that Ovechkin scored his 60th goal against the Atlanta Thrashers.
"
Waati jumɛn na Northern Rock Bank mako tun bɛ dɛmɛ na jamana marabulon yɔrɔ?,"The correct answer is **D: Lahawotafarankan waati**.

The passage states: ""Northern Rock mako tun bɛ dɛmɛ na k'a sababu kɛ a ka lakanabaliya ye san 2007 a ka lahawotafarankan min ye u bila dingɛ kɔnɔ."" This translates to: ""Northern Rock needed assistance because of its recklessness in 2007, which put them in trouble.""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu kumasenw jumɛn bi Virgin Group ka Northern Rock bank sani ɲɛfɔ tigitigi?","The correct answer is **A: Virgin Group fana ye Northern Rock warimaraso minɛkoɲuma tun san**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Virgin ye """" warimarasoɲuma"""" dɔrɔn san Northern Rock fɛ nka a ma kɛ minɛkoɲumajɛkulu ye."" This directly translates to Virgin buying only the ""good bank"" part of Northern Rock.
The other options are not supported by the passage.

*   **B: Virgin Group ye warimaraso san a kɛlen jamana warimaraso ye** - Incorrect. The passage says Virgin attempted a bid *before* nationalization.
*   **C: Virgin Group tun ye dɛmɛ di warimaraso ma lahawotafarankan waati la** - Incorrect. The passage states Northern Rock needed assistance, but there is no indication Virgin provided help.
*   **D: Virgin Group ka wɛntɛrɛ fɔlɔ warimaraso la kɛra warimaraso kɛlɛ jamana ta ye** - Incorrect. The passage stated that ""Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group tun banan laɲini dɔ la sani warimaraso in ka kɛ jamana ta ye."" Meaning that Virgin group was in the bidding process to acquire the bank before it was nationalized."
"Inafɔ a fɔlen bɛ tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ, jamana jumɛn ye ko sɔrɔ Kyoto bolonɔnbila waatiyɛlɛmabɛnkansɛbɛn na?","The correct answer is **C: Ɔsitarali**.

The passage states that Australian leaders decided to sign the Kyoto Protocol. While the US is mentioned as not having signed, the question asks specifically about a country that **did** sign.
"
Ɔsitrali laadajamanamarabulonɲɛmɔgɔ miirila ko bolonɔn bila Kyoto bɛnkansɛbɛn na tun bina se ka mun lase u ma tɔrɔ la?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

**C: Tajibayɛlɛmabalilabɔli**

The text states that Australian politicians feared that signing the Kyoto Protocol would hinder its economic development (tajibayɛlɛmabalilabɔli) compared to countries like China and India. Therefore, they believed signing the protocol would negatively impact their economic development.
"
Baarasira jumɛn tun hokumu kɔnɔ kisɛcilaw sifilɛli sugandila?,"The correct answer is **D: Farikoloɲɛnajɛ Kisɛcilaw ka Ton baarasira hokumu kɔnɔ**

The passage states: ""Yɛrɛbɔla jolenw sugandila **farikoloɲɛnajɛ Kisɛcilaw ka Ton baarasira hokumu kɔnɔ**."" This clearly indicates that the selection of rangers during the recruitment process was within the authority of the Farikoloɲɛnajɛ Kisɛcilaw ka Ton.
"
Ninnu kumasen jumɛn ti banayɛlɛma kunbɛli sifilɛli tigitigi jira?,"The correct answer is **C: Kisɛcilaw tun lajɛlen do yiri lakanabaw fɛ**

The passage states: ""Kisɛ cilaw banayɛlɛma kunbɛli sifilɛli in senfɛ tun kakan ka lajɛ kaɲɛ ji ni yiri lakanabaw fɛ..."" which translates to ""As part of the rock pool ecosystem monitoring program, it was agreed to monitor both water and seaweed protection..."" This directly supports option C.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, farali in tun sɔrɔ la min?","The answer is **B: Dugujukɔrɔfɛn dɔ la**.

The passage says ""O kɔrɔ ye ɲɛɲini min tun sinsinna dugujukɔrɔfɛnw ma kɔnna kojugu farali ɲɛ."" which translates to ""This means the research that was focused on underground resources was interrupted by a terrible find."" This indicates the interruption (farali) was related to underground resources (dugujukɔrɔfɛnw).
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de kɛra jona k’a kɔn waati makɔnɔnen ɲɛ?","The correct answer is **B: A farali**.

The sentence in the prompt states the search for underground resources was interrupted ""kojugu farali ɲɛ"", which translates to ""before an awful attack/invasion/disruption"". Therefore, the thing that happened sooner than expected was **A farali (An attack/invasion/disruption)**.
"
Ɲɛnajɛkɛla mako bina se mun kɛli ma yalasa ka taanikaseginw kɛ ɲɛnajɛ kɔnɔ?,"The correct answer is **D: Labaaralikɛla in munumununi fiyɛn fɛ**

The passage states ""O b'a to ɲɛnajɛkɛlaw ka se ka ɲɛnajɛ in kɛwalew ni taanikaseginw kɛ u sago la ni mansin in munumununi ye fiyɛn fɛ."" which translates to ""That allows players to perform the actions and feedback in the game as they please by waving the console.""
"
Mun tun dilanna na bɔlen bɛ jabarani yɔrɔjanlabaarala fɛ?,"Based on the passage, the thing that was designed by the designer from the gaming industry is:

*   **B: Nintendo Revolution labaaralikɛla in**

The passage states that Satoru Iwata ""yira cakɛda in Nintendo Revolution labaaralikɛla kura"" (""showed the company's new Nintendo Revolution labaaralikɛla""). It then goes on to describe this labaaralikɛla as being designed by someone from the ""jabarani yɔrɔjanlabaarala"" (gaming industry)."
Mun tun ma fɔ kunafoniw bɛɛ laban na Xinhua kunafoniso fɛ?,"Let's analyze the text to see what wasn't mentioned in the *final* Xinhua report.

*   **P: Yani o cɛ Sini kunafoniso Xinhua y'a fɔ ko pankurun dɔ tun kunmayɛlɛmana.** (Xinhua initially said a plane was hijacked.)
*   **Kunafoni labanw y'a sɛbɛntiya tuguni ko pankurun in ye mugujugu farati Kunafoni dɔ sɔrɔ w'a y'a damunu ka jigin Afuganisitan jamana na Kandahar.** (Later reports corrected it, saying the plane had a severe threat, leading it to divert and land in Kandahar, Afghanistan.)
*   **Kunnafoni fɔlɔfɔlɔw ko pankurun in damununa k'a ɲɛisin Afuganisitan jamana ma u dɛsɛlen kɔ ka jiginni karabalen yamaruya sɔrɔ Urumqi.** (Initial reports said it diverted to Afghanistan after failing to get emergency landing permission in Urumqi.)

The final report mentioned:
* The plane had a severe threat.
* It was diverted and landed in Kandahar.

The final report did *not* mention:
* The plane was initially meant to land in Ürümqi.
* The plane diverted to Afghanistan.

Therefore, the answer is B: Pankurun in tun jiginna Ürümqi
"
Mun tun ma fɔ Xinhua baarabolo kura ka fɔlɔ fɔlɔ kibaruya fɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Pankurun nin tun dɛsɛlen ka jigin karabalen yamaruya la**.

The passage states: ""Kunnafoni fɔlɔfɔlɔw  ko pankurun in damununa k'a ɲɛisin Afuganisitan jamana ma u dɛsɛlen kɔ ka jiginni karabalen  yamaruya sɔrɔ Urumqi."" This translates to: ""The first reports said the plane was diverted to Afghanistan after *failing* to receive permission to land in Urumqi.""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A:** The initial Xinhua report *did* state the plane was hijacked.
*   **C:** The initial reports focused on the *diversion* of the plane *to* Afghanistan, not its return from Afghanistan.
*   **D:** The detail about the plane having a mechanical failure was mentioned in *later* reports, not the initial one.

"
Mun de tun ladɔnniya kɛra Sara Danius fɛ rajo kan jɛmukan dɔ senfɛ?,"The correct answer is **D: Komite bina weleli ko bolobila Bob Dylan fɛ**.

The passage states ""Danius ye a fɔ ko, """" Ni waati in na sisan, an te ka foyi kɛ...Danius ye a fɔ ko, """" Ni waati in na sisan, an te ka foyi kɛ. Ne ye nɛkɛ juru ci ani ka bɔlɔlɔ sɛbɛn ci a masuruna baraɲɔgɔnw ma minw ye n' jabi ɲuman na. O be wasakɛ fɔlɔ."" This directly translates to the committee calling Bob Dylan by telephone.
"
Jɔnni de tun se ka sɔrɔ?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**

The passage states that the committee was trying to reach Bob Dylan to talk about him winning the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature.
"
"""Jɔnni de tunna weleweleda tɔgɔda ko """"Senɲɛ Kankaran""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Worodugu Kore ka laselikɛra**.

The passage states that George W. Bush's spokesman, Gordon Johndroe, called South Korea's actions ""a setback to the goal of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula,"" tagging it with the nickname """"Senɲɛ Kankaran dɔ"""". Therefore, Worodugu Kore ka laselikɛra (South Korea's actions) are what the phrase refers to.
"
Bolonɔnbilanaw joli tun dilanna Słania jamana caman ye?,"The text states: ""A ye bolonɔnbilana 1000 ni a kunkanfɛn dilan Suwɛdi ni jamana 28 wɛrɛw ye."" This means he designed 1000 stamps *in addition* to other things, for Sweden and 28 other countries. So, a little over 1000.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 1,000 ni kɔ** (1,000 and more).
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de bɔlen do bondo da sɔgɔli banbali kun fɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Fiɲɛbilada**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Araba wuladayanfan fɛ bondowoniw tun bɛ ka bɔ walema a tun bɛ ka bɔ +D301:D400fiɲɛbilada fɛ bondo kɔnɔ."" This directly translates to ""Arabian wildlands were leaking, or it was leaking from the vent within the bondo.""
*   The other options are mentioned in the context of the overall incident but don't specifically describe what was leaking directly from the vent:
    *   A: While the second storage area was approaching full, it doesn't describe leakage from the vent.
    *   B & D: The fire inspection is the *cause* of the initial problem, not what is *leaking* from the vent.

"
Munna bɔlidaw tun yɛlɛla?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuran tun tigɛra sɛgɛsɛgɛli kɔfɛ**

The text says the ""bɔlidaw yɛlɛ wa taji kɛnɛ poyira ka bɔ Fort Greely tajisamaniso 9 kɛrɛfɛ"" because ""Kuran tigɛ kɛra tasuma sɛgɛsɛgɛli gansan dɔ senfɛ min ye  bɔlidaw yɛlɛ wa taji kɛnɛ poyira"".
"
"Ni waati in, The Ninth Ward ji jaɲan je joli ye?","The correct answer is **A: Fiti 20**.

The passage states that ""The Ninth Ward, min fala ji la fo fiti 20 ɲɔgɔnna Hurricane Katrina senfɛ"" which translates to ""The Ninth Ward, which was flooded up to 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina"". This directly answers the question of how high the water reached in The Ninth Ward at that time.
"
"Hurricane Katrina senfɛ, mun tun kɛra The Ninth Ward la?","The correct answer is **C: Fala ji tun walankata la fo fiti 20 ɲɔgɔnna**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""The Ninth Ward, min fala ji la fo fiti 20 ɲɔgɔnna Hurricane Katrina senfɛ..."" (The Ninth Ward, which was flooded up to about 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina...)

Options A, B, and D are all mentioned in the passage, but they are either not directly about what happened *to* The Ninth Ward, or they are misinterpretations/exaggerations.
"
Ninnu jumɛn kelen tun ma sɛmɛntiya Hamilton fɛ?,"The correct answer is **D: Banabaatɔ ka sisa lahala ya**.

The passage mentions:

*   **A: Banabaatɔ in tun tara yɔrɔ min:** It mentions the patient was from Nigeria where there was an Ebola outbreak.
*   **B: Banabaatɔ tɔw ka bana kisɛ sigana sɔrɔli:** The passage explicitly says the hospital used established protocols for infection control, separating the patient to prevent spread.
*   **C: N’a sɔrɔla banayɛlɛma kunbɛ taabolo tun bato la:** The passage clearly states that the hospital followed established protocols for infection control.

The passage does *not* mention how the patient was disposed if he died. Therefore, D is the correct answer.
"
Ɲɛɲinikɛlaw b’a fɛ ka ko jumɛn ko?,"The correct answer is **D: Dugukolo dilanbɛ cogodi**.

The passage focuses on researchers' hope to understand how planets formed, especially Earth, from the initial impact of asteroids and comets to the present day. Therefore, understanding Earth's formation (Dugukolo dilanbɛ cogodi) is the main focus.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, sigida lakanatigilamɔgɔ jɔyɔrɔ kɛra mun ni in baara ban ni na?","The correct answer is **A: U tun ye FBI nege tun ka baara in ban**.

The passage states that ""Mariland taakasegi ɲɛmɔgɔw ye baara ban ni FBI ye min nege tun wilila"" which directly translates to ""Maryland state troopers ended the operation with the FBI that was requested."" This means they ended the operation that the FBI had requested.
"
Mun tun kɛra dingɛdondaw jɔsɔ waati la?,"The correct answer is **B: U tun kɛra inafɔ ka sira munumunu dɔ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ŋamancɛmɔbiliw tun kɛra ka dingɛdondaw jɔsɔ ani dɛmɛbaga lakanatigilamɔgɔ 80 tun wilini do ka jɔ walasa ka mɔtɔtigiw bila ka sira munu."" which translates to ""Emergency vehicles were used to create blockades and 80 auxiliary police officers were deployed to allow motorists to clear the road.""

Therefore, the purpose of the blockades was to clear the road.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun tuma kɛ sanni jatala tun ka furan bolifɛn in fɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Jatala tun ye lakanatigilamɔgɔw jaw ta yani ka sira tigɛ**

The passage states: ""Ɲanajɛ kunnafoniw bɔlɔlɔ sira TMZ b'a faamu ko jatala tuny'a ka bolifɛn jɔ Sepulveda nbɛda kɛrɛ dɔ in fɛ ani ka sɔrɔ ka lakanatigilamɔgɔw siracamanfarayɔrɔ jaw ta yani ka sira tigɛ ka sɔrɔ ka tɛmɛ ka taa...""

This translates to: ""According to TMZ, the victim parked their vehicle near Sepulveda Boulevard and then took photos of the law enforcement crosswalk before attempting to cross the street.""

Therefore, taking photos of the law enforcement crosswalk happened before the victim tried to cross the street, implying it happened before being struck.
"
Jatala tun be fɛ ka mun kɛ sanni a ka furan bolifɛn in fɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Lakanatigilamɔgɔw jaw jatali yani ka sira tigɛ**

The text states: ""Ɲanajɛ kunnafoniw bɔlɔlɔ sira TMZ b'a faamu ko jatala tuny'a ka bolifɛn jɔ Sepulveda nbɛda kɛrɛ dɔ in fɛ ani ka sɔrɔ ka lakanatigilamɔgɔw siracamanfarayɔrɔ jaw ta yani ka sira tigɛ...""

This translates to: ""Sources told TMZ that the person parked their car on Sepulveda, took pictures of the intersection, and then crossed the street...""
"
Ninnu kumasen jumɛn ti Peresidan ka lahaliya ɲɛfɔ a jiralen ko a ye banakisɛ juguba dɔ sɔrɔ tigi jira?,"The correct answer is **C: A ka lahaliya kafisa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Peresidan ka lahalya kafisa, hali ni a ye sɔrɔ a bena bila a kelen ka tile caaman kƐ."" This directly translates to ""The President's isolation is better, even if it means he will be alone for many days.""
*   This statement is being made in the context of M. Arias contracting a ""juguba dɔ sɔrɔ"" (serious illness), which is confirmed by the President's brother, the Minister of Planning.

Therefore, the President's isolation is considered better because it addresses the situation of Arias' illness. The other options do not directly address the explanation for the President's isolation:

*   A: A fari mandi a la - His body is fine (This is not the reason for isolation.)
*   B: Ɲɔɔnɔdimin b’ala - He has diabetes (There is no such claim made by anyone)
*   D: Farikalaya b’ala - He has fever (This could be the result of sickness but is not the reason for the President's isolation.)"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu kumasen jumɛnw Peresidan ka ye tiɲɛ ye?","The correct answer is **C: A ka kɛnɛ kɔsɔbɛ nin la ka baara kɛ yɔrɔjanfɛ** (He is very careful about his health so he can work for a long time).

Here's why:

*   The passage directly states: ""Farikalaya ni ɲɔɔnɔdimin, basi foyi te na wa n ka kƐnƐ kɔsɔbƐ nin la yasa n’ka baara kƐ yɔrɔjanfƐ"" which translates to ""Being careful and keeping a distance, there is nothing wrong and I am very careful about my health so I can work for a long time.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Farikalaya t’ala (He is not being careful)** This is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that he *is* being careful.
*   **B: A bena bila so ka tile dɔgɔkun caman kɛ (He will be stuck at home for many weeks)** The passage implies he *might* be isolated, but it doesn't definitively say it will be for weeks.
*   **D: Banakisɛ juguba de y’a sɔrɔ (He has contracted a serious illness)** The passage states ""M. Arias ye a jira ko a ye banakisƐ juguba dɔ sɔrɔ"", which translates to ""M. Arias indicated that he has contracted a serious illness"". So this is actually TRUE and not FALSE, but since the question asks what the *President* said, this answer is incorrect because the information about having a serious illness is being attributed to M. Arias and not the President.

Therefore, the only statement that accurately reflects what the President *himself* says in the passage is **C**."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, waati jumɛnna Fiɲɛjuguba Gonu sigi tun kɛra ni o jigili ye ka taa a fɛ?","The correct answer is **B: Waati jumɛnna fiɲɛteliya tun bɛ kilomɛtɛrɛ 83 sanga kelen kɔnɔ**.

The passage states: ""Bi sɔgɔmajona fɛ, fiɲɛteliya tun bɛ kilomɛtɛrɛ 83 sanga kelen kɔnɔ, ani sigi tun kɛra ni o jigili ye ka taa a fɛ."" This directly translates to ""This morning, the wind speed was 83 kilometers per hour, and it was settling with it falling"". So, the phrase refers to when the wind speed was at 83 km/h.
"
Fiɲɛteliya dan tun bɛ joli Fiɲɛjuguba Gonu senfɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Nɔngɔnɲɛ 149 sanga kelen kɔnɔ**

The text states ""k'a to a dan bɛɛ la tun bɛ kɛ funufunuba min bɛ kilomɛtɛrɛ 240 boli sanga kelen kɔnɔ (nɔngɔnɲɛ 149 sanga kelen kɔnɔ)."" This clearly indicates the highest wind speed recorded for Cyclone Gonu was 149 miles per hour.
"
Ninnu jumɛn ti jate Karenia brevis sɔn fɛ?,"Let's analyze the passage provided in the context of the question:

The passage states:
* ""Jifunufunubile sababu ye faraɲɔgɔnkanba min tɛ deli ka kɛ Karenia brevis fɛ, min ye kɔkɔjikuruso ye min bɛ bɔ a yɛrɛ ma.""  This tells us that Karenia brevis is a ""kɔkɔjikuruso min bɛ bɔ a yɛrɛ ma,"" which translates to ""microorganism/algae that comes from itself/naturally occurs."" This supports option D.
* ""Yɛrɛlapoyisababuw bɛ se ka nerotokesine dii min bese adamadenw ni jƐgƐw fila BƐƐ fasaw ja."" This means ""Its effects can release neurotoxins that affect the health of both humans and fish."" This supports option B.

Let's examine each option against the passage:

*   **A: Yɛrɛlapoyisababuw suguya dɔ do** - The passage doesn't directly say *what* type of effect it is, only that it *has* effects that can produce neurotoxins. So, while potentially true, it's not directly supported.

*   **B: A bi se ka adamadenw fasaw ja** -  The passage states Karenia brevis' effects (yɛrɛlapoyisababuw) can release neurotoxins that affect the health of humans. This is directly supported by the passage.

*   **C: A seliluw ka ca** -  The passage doesn't discuss the abundance of the cells, only that it is a naturally occurring organism.

*   **D: A bina yɛrɛma** -  The passage states Karenia brevis is a microorganism ""min bɛ bɔ a yɛrɛ ma"" which means ""that comes from itself/naturally occurs.""

Therefore, the most accurate answers based on the provided passage are B and D.
"
Ninnu jumɛn ma se ka kɛ Karena brevis fɛ?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: Nerotokesine dili**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Yɛrɛlapoyisababuw bɛ se ka nerotokesine dii min bese adamadenw ni jƐgƐw fila BƐƐ fasaw ja"" which means the red tide can release neurotoxins that affect both humans and fish.
* Option A (Jɛgɛw fasaw jali) which means fish deaths, is listed as a potential effect of neurotoxins.
* Option B (Hakɛ cayali cogoya bɛɛ la) which means increased amount of everything, is not mentioned as being a result of Karenia brevis. Instead, the passage mentions it causing an increase in bacteria.
* Option C (Ji tiɲɛni) which means water deterioration, is not clearly stated, but implied when the passage mentions a bacteria that affects humans."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn makɛ inafɔ Felicia sanfiɲɛba nɔ?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Sankisɛ nafama**.

The passage states: ""SankisƐw, sera fo 6,34 pusew ma ni suguya dɔ ye Oahu kunna, lakalira i na fɔ ‘’ ko nafama’’ (Storm surges, reaching up to 6.34 feet in some areas of Oahu, were described as ''significant'').""

While the passage also mentions other effects like ""sanfiɲƐbaw ni tunma ni tunma sanpƐrƐn (strong winds and occasional heavy rain),"" the passage explicitly describes storm surges as ""significant."" The passage never claims the storm surges are directly related to any damage or water damage.
"
Ninnu kumasen jumɛn te tiɲɛn ye Felicia Sanfiɲɛba kan?,"The correct answer is **B: A tun sigiyɔrɔmalen be inafɔ depresiyɔn tropical dɔ sann’a ka kɛ sanfiɲɛba hakɛ 4 dɔ ye**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage clearly states Felicia strengthened *from* a tropical depression to a Category 4 hurricane.** Option B states the opposite.
*   The other options are all supported by the passage:
    *   **A:** The passage mentions ""''useful'' surges"" on Oahu.
    *   **C:** The passage mentions the ""majority of the islands were rained on"".
    *   **D:** The passage mentions ""surges associated with hurricane winds and periodic showers."""
Ninnu kumasen jumɛn bi Hɔngiri 2009 Grand Prix kɔ jabi tigitigi jira?,"The correct answer is **C: Piquet Jr. tun bilara ka bɔbarala kɔfɛ** (Piquet Jr. was fired afterwards).

The passage states: ""Piquet Jr. Bilara ka bɔbarala Hɔngiri 2009 Grand Prix kɔfƐ."" This translates directly to Piquet Jr. was fired after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.
"
Waati jumɛn kasara in kɛra?,"The correct answer is **B: Tuma minna mobili tɔw tun bɛ taji ta la (Tuma minna mobiliw tun bɛ taji ɲinni lakana mobili kɔrɔ)**

The passage states that when Alonso was right behind Piquet Jr.'s crash, the other cars went to pit for fuel because of the safety car. This implies the crash happened *while* other cars were pitting.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn tun ma waati jan taa ka tɛmɛ ɲɛɲinnikɛlawka jate fɔlɔ kan?","The correct answer is **A: Kɔnɔn sukuya dɔw dilanni**. Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""ɲɛɲinnikɛlaw ka bɔ Prince University Etats Unis kɔnɔ ani Uppsala University Swede kɔnɔ ye kɔnɔsukuyakuraw nunu kofɔ yɛlɛma ko fila durɔn kɔnɔ"" which translates to ""Researchers from Prince University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden observed these finches evolving in just two generations."" This implies that the evolution (and thus the *change*) was rapid.

The question is asking for the thing that *didn't* take a long time. The passage focuses on the fast *evolution* of certain finches, indicating the *creation* of the new finches was rapid. The other options are related to actions that would follow that creation or observation and aren't directly related to timescale mentioned."
Ninnu jumɛn tun ma kofɔ ɲɛɲinnikɛlaw fɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Kɔnɔsukuyakuraw bɔli jayan**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Kɔnɔsukuyakuraw tun be ka dilan yɔrɔ min:** The passage mentions the location as ""Equateur Galápagos Islands"".
*   **B: Kɔnɔsukuyakuraw bɔli jayan:** The exact time of the finches' emergence or evolution is not detailed, only the period of change (two generations).
*   **C: Kɔnɔsukuyakuraw ninnu tɔgɔ:** The names of the finches are mentioned in the passage such as ""Darwin ni Geospiza fortes"" and ""Geospiza Conirostris"".
*   **D: Kɔnɔsukuyakuraw ninnu baloli:** The passage details what they eat: ""balo ye cɔrɔnideni Darwin ni Geospiza fortes, ani cactus cɔrɔni, Geospiza Conirostris cɛ"" (the food is Darwin finch and cactus finch Geospiza Conirostris).

Therefore, the passage *does not* specify the exact time of emergence or evolution of these finches."
Misi Yɛgɛleli binna kɛ min?,"The correct answer is **C: Erɔpu tilebin-kɔrɔnyanfa fɛ**.

The passage explicitly states that the city will be the first to host cow parades in northeastern Europe (""Dugu i bɛ na kɛ a siɲɛ fɔlɔ ye ka taama kɛ ni missi yɛgɛlew ye erɔpu tilebin-kɔrɔnyanfa na""). Therefore, the cow parade will occur in northeastern Europe.
"
Ninnu kumasenw jumɛn bi Misi Yɛgɛleli ɲɛfɔ tigitigi?,"Based on the provided text (P), the most accurate answer is:

**C: Seko jirali do min tun kɛra tilema kɔnɔ Erɔpu tilebin-kɔrɔnyanfan fɛ**

Here's why:

*   The text mentions ""...dugu i bɛ na kɛ a siɲɛ fɔlɔ ye ka taama kɛ ni missi yɛgɛlew ye erɔpu tilebin-kɔrɔnyanfa na..."" This indicates that the ""Missi Yɛgɛlew"" are something being performed/happening for the first time in Eastern Europe. ""Seko jirali"" can be translated to ""performance"".
*   The text indicates it is happening at a specific time of year: ""mi kɛla zuwɛn ni uti kalow ni ɲɔgɔn cɛ ni san i na""
*   It says it is a ""jamakafowale"", which is a gathering, party, or event.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

*   **A:** While it is happening in a city, the text doesn't emphasize that it's *only* happening in major cities. It is happening for the ""first time"" in the city mentioned, but it doesn't rule out it happening in many cities.
*   **B:** The text doesn't mention anything about Bucharest City Hall.
*   **D:** While the text indicates that it is ""jamakafowale"", which implies it is a public event, it doesn't necessarily imply that it is a ""great"" or ""big"" show, or explicitly a competition.

**Therefore, option C best captures the meaning conveyed in the original text about ""Missi Yɛgɛleli"".**"
Mun de y’a to Irisi II-76 labaarali jɔ?,"The correct answer is **B: Kasara dɔ (A crash)**

The passage states: ""Irisi jamana ye II-76 lapanni jɔ waati kunkurun na kasara in kɔfɛ."" This translates to ""The Irish nation suspended II-76 flights for a short time after the crash."" So the reason for the suspension was the crash.
"
Mun ye II-76?,"Based on the text, the correct answer is:

C: Pankurun dɔ

The passage states: ""Pankurun in kun kunsinnen do Irikusiki ma wa tun be ka boli kɔnɔna kuluw fɛ...Laɲini dɔ kɛra walasa ka ɲininiw kɛ II-76 in ye Irisi ni Sowiyeti kɛlɛbolo nafamafɛn ba dɔ ye kabini san 1970w kɔnɔna na..."" This directly identifies the II-76 as a ""pankurun"" (airplane).
"
Jɔnni ye Simpson sɛbɛnba kulu ta?,"The correct answer is **B: Simon**.

The text states ""San 1989 a sen yera Simpson la ani Brooks ni Groening wa jɛmukan in sɛbɛnba kulu fɔlɔ tali tunb'a bolo."" which translates to ""In 1989 he joined The Simpsons and Brooks and Groening and was in charge of the first writing team of the show.""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni Fluke fɛla ye, jɔnni tun bɛ ka hakilinaɲumaw ni maguwan kumaw ci?","The text says ""...hakilinaɲuma bayirikaw cira a ma ka maguwan don a la musow ni cɛw fɛ..."" This translates to ""…sent good ideas and illusions among women and men…""

Therefore, the answer is **D: Musow ni cɛw** (Women and men).
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mɔgɔ dɔw ta fɛ muso ka kuman mun ka?","The correct answer is **C: Musow ka kɛnɛya** (Women's health).

The passage states that Fluke worked to undo tactics that prevented women from speaking about their health. Therefore, the passage implies that some people wanted to stop women from talking about their health.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, dolomanfɛn kelen jumɛn de galabu ka kɛnɛ bɛla ye?","The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

The passage states: ""...dolomanfɛn kelen dɔrɔn de galabu ka kɛnɛ ni Titan ye, wa tɔgɔ ye Dugukolo"". This means Titan is the celestial body being compared.
"
Kɔw ni lakiw ka ji jɛli tun yera dolomanfɛn kelen jumɛn de ka?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

The passage states: ""Anw ka dɔnta la, dolomanfɛn kelen dɔrɔn de galabu ka kɛnɛ ni Titan ye, wa tɔgɔ ye Dugukolo"" which means ""In our solar system, the only celestial body that has seas like Titan, and it is named Earth"". This indicates that Titan has seas.

Ninnu jabi jumɛn ma sɔrɔ jolo sɛnbɛntiya fɛ?,"The best answer is **D: Sɛnbɛntiyali ka fɔ ko jolo bɛ dinozɔri caman fɛ.**

Here's why:

*   **P** starts by stating that science now believes some dinosaurs had color, which is the core idea presented in the text.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

*   **A: Datanfɛn in faarikansi kulɛri** - This is too specific. While the text mentions the pigment composition, the broader point is the presence of color itself.
*   **B: Faamuyali min ba jira ko jolo tun ma kɛ ka pannikɛ** - This focuses on only *one* aspect implied, which is camouflage and is not the main point.
*   **C: Kɔnɔw siiko ɲɛtaa faamu li** - This is related to understanding dinosaur evolution, but the core message is about confirming their color.
"
Mun tun tɛ dinozɔri jolo ma na?,"The passage states: ""O be a sɛnbɛntiya dɔrɔn ko jolo tun be dinozɔr nunu dɔw la, kumakan min caarilen don ka ban, ɲa a be ɲƐfɔli dɔw dii ni ni fɛnkɔrɔ te se ka o dii tu ma bɛƐ, ina fɔ suguya ani KƐcogo sigiyɔrɔmasaba hakɛ."" This translates to: ""It is only through the power that the skin of some dinosaurs had, a language that has been used a lot, that it can give explanations that others cannot give, such as type and behavioral environmental aspects.""
It further states: ""Nin lakodonni fƐnnƐn be a to kɔnɔw siiko ɲƐtaa ka faamu kaɲƐ kɔsɔbƐ. Sabula dinosoriw sikalaw ma janya ka ɲƐ, min ni a be wele ko rasi, ɲa siiw kƐcogo wƐrƐw be a ala – siikisƐ ni sii - ɲinninlikƐbaw ye a famu ko rasiw tun be janya ka bɔ u yƐrƐla a cogoya tow kɔfƐ."" This translates to: ""This scientific record allows for a much better understanding of the development of eggs. The scales of the dinosaurs did not resemble much to what is called resin. However, other ways of eggs - the examination of eggs and eggshells - leading researchers understand that the scale resin differs from the appearance and shape of eggs.""
And lastly, the passage mentions: ""Ɲinnilaw ye u ka halikilina jira ko, halini dinɔsɔridenni de kukala ko do, esantiyɔn in be a kɔrɔbalen sii de jira ɲa jƐgƐfara tƐ."" translates to ""Researchers revealed that, despite dinosaur eggshell being thin, this example shows that matured eggshells do not crack like normal eggshells.""

Therefore, the correct answer must be B: Rasi.
"
Ninnu kumasenw jumɛn ye tiɲɛn ye ZMapp?,"Let's analyze the provided information to determine which statements about ZMapp are true.

*   **P:** The passage states ZMapp is made of antibodies (faarikolo dɛmɛlan jiw).
*   **Q:** The passage says that no medicine had been discovered or was developed to fight the underlying viruses.
*   **R:** The passage specifically says that ZMapp was used to make estimates in the PALM investigation.
*   **S:** The passage states that studies showed it to be less useful than thought initially for reducing mortality.

Therefore, the correct answers are **A, C, and D**."
Ninnu kumasenw jumɛn bi PALM mafilɛli ɲɛfɔ tigitigi?,"The correct answer is **B: Fura jateminɛnen tun bɛ ka sankan ni fura suguya wɛrɛ saba ye, u dɔla kelen ye ZMapp ye.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""PALM mafilƐli la, ZMapp kƐra ka jateminƐ de ye, a be i nafɔ dɔnnikƐlaw ye a taa ka baarakƐ ni a ye i nafɔ jateminƐlan ani u ye a sanga furakƐlicogo saba wƐrƐw ma."" This directly translates to: ""In the PALM trial, ZMapp was a treatment being evaluated, helping researchers to work with it as a treatment and compare it to three other treatment approaches.""

The other options are not directly supported by the text.

"
Yɔrɔ jumɛn na ɲinninikɛlaw y’a miiri ko pisi kura in binna kɛ nafaba ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Dɛsɛbato jamanaw**.

The text specifically states the researchers believe this new device will be particularly useful in resource-limited countries (""dɛsɛbato jamana la""), where early detection of diseases like tuberculosis (""boɔ bana""), HIV/AIDS (""SIDA bana""), and malaria (""Sumaya"") is crucial but often difficult due to limited resources. The text also mentions how the lower rate of tuberculosis infection detection compared to wealthy countries (""setigi jamanaw ta tila"") highlight the need for such affordable devices.
"
Fɛɛrɛ jumɛn binna tigɛ ka sɛgɛsɛgɛli minanw dilan?,"The correct answer is **B: Ɛnpirmanti ankirimaw**

The passage states: ""pisi fitifitinin do min bese ka dilan ni **Ɛnpirmanti ankirima** ye US wari tama ɲɔgɔnna a kelen o kelen songɔ ye""

This directly says the chips are made with ink.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kumasen jumɛn jolinɔ fununen ka te tiɲɛ ye?","The correct answer is **B: U kɛli ye b’a jira ko kalo farala-lawaleya ko foyi te ye**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ni jolinɔ nunu yera kalo fan bɛɛ fɛ w'a be inafɔ u ma yɛlɛma kɔsɛbɛ, min b'a yira ko faralawaleya ko minnu y'u kɛ u ma mɛ. Ni hakilinasira in be kuma sɔsɔ min b'a fɔ ko farala-lawaleya ko foyi te kalo kan."" This directly translates to: ""If these swirls are seen all over the moon and they don't seem to change much, it suggests the forces that created them are no longer active. This idea challenges the claim that there is no geological activity on the moon.""
*   So, the fact that the swirls seem unchanged suggests a lack of current geological activity, which supports the claim that there is little to no geological activity on the moon."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, hakilinasira jumɛn ka ɲɛsin yɔrɔkɛcogo ma b’a jira ko kalo farala-lawaleya bɛ sena kalo sanfɛ?","The correct answer is **B: Yɔrɔkɛcogow tun dilanna waati ja** (The spots were formed a long time ago).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the lunar swirls (yɔrɔkɛcogo) have not changed much over time. This lack of change implies that the processes that created them are no longer active, suggesting they were formed a long time ago (waati ja).
* The premise states that the spots have not changed much, demonstrating that the processes that formed them are no longer active, implying that they were created a long time ago.
*   The other options are either directly contradicted by the passage (A) or not explicitly supported by the given information (C and D)."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de caman tina sɔrɔ fo jalakili ka kɛ?","The correct answer is **B: Jaw jɛnsɛnni (Image dissemination)**.

The passage clearly states that the dissemination of the suspect's image is a major concern. Professor Pamela Ferguson says that the media is walking a dangerous line by disseminating the images and other personal information. This indicates that the image dissemination is causing significant problems.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de tɛ jɛgɛminɛkurun mɔgɔw ka sisan gɛlɛya ye?","The passage states: ""Ka fara jikuru jiginni kan, waati gɛlɛya cogow kɛra ka lakisili wilikajɔw sumaya."" This means that in addition to ice formation, weather conditions have made it difficult to cool the landing wheels.

The question asks: ""According to the passage, what is *not* a current difficulty for fishermen?""

*   **A: Waati gɛlɛya cogow (Weather conditions):** The passage states weather conditions *are* a difficulty.
*   **B: Jikuru hakɛ (Ice quantity):** The passage talks about ""jikuru hakɛba"" (large amount of ice), implying it's a problem.
*   **C: Jikuru boyan (Ice density):** The passage *doesn't* explicitly mention the density of the ice.
*   **D: Jikuru jiginni (Ice formation):** The passage states ice formation *is* a difficulty.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Jikuru boyan (Ice density)** because the passage doesn't mention it as a current difficulty.
"
"Ka fara jikuru ka, mun wɛrɛ kɛra lakisili wilikajɔw la?","Based on the passage P, the answer is **B: Waati cogoyaw** (Waati gɛlɛya cogow kɛra ka lakisili wilikajɔw sumaya). This translates to ""Harsh weather conditions contributed to the decline of rockfish.""
"
Dannaya jumɛn tun ya to Roberts ma sɔn?,"The correct answer is **C: Ɲɛnɛmaya daminɛ**.

The passage states that Roberts *believes* that life begins. The question asks what Roberts *refused to concede*. Therefore, Roberts did not concede the beginning of life."
Roberts tun miiri la hakilina jugu jumɛn kuman maɲi?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Sanfɛ Kiiribulon ka kiiri ɲumanw**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Nka, a seginn'a ka kuma tɛmɛnen kan ko Roev. Wade tunye """"dugukolo sariyasen labɛnnen in ye"""", k'a sinsin **Sanfɛ Kiiribulɔn ka kiiri ɲuman nafa kan**"". This directly indicates Roberts emphasized the importance of the Supreme Court's precedents.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   B: Roev. Wade ka dantigɛli: While Roe v. Wade is mentioned, Roberts is actually referring to past talks concerning it.
*   C: dogodogoli: The word ""dogodogoli"" is present in the passage but not as the concept of Roberts' sentiment.
*   D: Hakɛ fɔlen in na dogodogoli la: This talks about hiding something in the process of the Roe decision-making, so it's inaccurate.
"
Yeelen sira fila bɛ min?,"The correct answer is **A: Ɲɛsin sankolo ma**.

The passage states: ""Yeelen sira fila tigɛra ka u ɲɛsin fo sankolo ma su kɔnɔ."" (Two beams of light were erected aiming towards the sky at night).
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, waati jumɛnna sangasojan jɔlibaaraw tun be sen na a yɔrɔ la?","The correct answer is **C: Su kɔnɔ**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Yeelen sira fila tigɛra ka u ɲɛsin fo sankolo ma **su kɔnɔ**"" which means ""Two beams of light were cut, directing them to the sky **at night**"". Then it says ""Yen yɔrɔ la sangasojan duuru jɔlibaaraw be sen na..."" which means ""In that place, the five memorials of the fallen soldiers were present..."". This connects the fallen soldiers' memorials to the night (su kɔnɔ)."
Kunnafoni jumɛn y’a jira ko Balimamuso Wolonfilaw ye kuluwow de ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Waatiyɛlɛmaw**.

The passage explicitly states ""waatiyɛlɛmaw b'a yira k'a fɔ kuluwow de don"" which translates to ""weather patterns indicate that they are mountains"".
"
Funteni hakɛ bɛ cogodi Balimamuso Wolonfilaw jateminɛnina?,"The passage states: ""Ɛnfirauruzijaw b'a yira ko su ni tile, waatiyɛlɛmaw b'a yira k'a fɔ kuluwow de don. U sumani do kɔnɔ na ka tɛmɛ kɔ kan tile fɛ, ani u funteni ka bon su fɛ ka tɛmɛ.""

This translates to: ""Infrared radiation shows the night and day temperatures, and weather models indicate they are mountains. They are cooler during the day than expected, and warmer at night than expected.""

The question is: ""Funteni hakɛ bɛ cogodi Balimamuso Wolonfilaw jateminɛnina?"" which means ""How is the temperature of the Seven Sisters (Balimamuso Wolonfilaw) measured?""

Based on the passage, infrared radiation (""Ɛnfirauruzijaw"") is used to determine the day and night temperatures.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Ɛnfirauruzijaw**
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kumasen jumɛn te tiɲɛn ye siga mɔgɔ in ka?","The correct answer is **C: A siya dɔnnen do lakanatigilamɔgɔw fɛ**

Here's why:

*   **P (From the passage):** A b'nafɔ ko cɛ in ya sensaba mɔbili dɔ boli mugujuguw tun be min na k'a ɲɛsin jama dɔ ma. Siga be cɛ min na nugujugu in cili la minɛna a kɛlen kɔ ka bana muguwili in senfɛ. A tɔgɔ ma dɔn fɔlɔ ɲɛmɔgɔw fɛ, hali n'u b'a dɔn ka ye Uighur siya mɔgɔ ye. (Translation: The man is suspected of being behind a car bomb attack targeting a crowd. The suspect in the bombing was arrested after fleeing the scene. His identity was initially unknown to authorities, although they believe he is of Uighur descent.)

*   **Analysis:**

    *   The passage explicitly states the man's *identity* was unknown initially. However, they *suspect* he is Uighur. This means his ethnicity was **not** definitively known to the authorities at first.
    *   The passage mentions he was arrested after fleeing the scene and was injured in the process.
    *   The passage says that he is suspected of being behind a car bomb attack.
*   **Evaluating the Options:**

    *   A: Bolimafɛ tun b’a bolo binkanni wale kɔnɔ (He was holding explosives during the attack) - TRUE. Based on the passage, the person is suspected of being behind a car bomb attack targeting a crowd.
    *   B: A tun y’a tukun ka mugujugu in ci (He fled after throwing the explosives) - TRUE. The suspect was arrested after fleeing the scene
    *   C: A siya dɔnnen do lakanatigilamɔgɔw fɛ (His ethnicity was known to the authorities) - FALSE. The passage clearly states that his identity was initially unknown to authorities.
    *   D: A tun ma bana (He wasn't injured) - FALSE. The passage states he was arrested after fleeing the scene and was injured in the process.

Therefore, the only statement that is not true is **C**."
Ka ɲɛsin binkanni wale kunnafoni jumɛn tin sɛmɛntiyala lakanatigilamɔgɔw fɛ?,"Based on the provided text, the following information is known to authorities:

*   **B: Siganamɔgɔ siya** (The suspect's ethnicity - Uighur)

The text specifically states ""hali n'u b'a dɔn ka ye Uighur siya mɔgɔ ye"" which means they know he is likely of Uighur ethnicity.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Kojugukɛɲɔgɔnw bɛɛ bugunnatikɛliw:** The text doesn't give any indication that they know all the details of the attack.
*   **C: Sabubuya mu y’u bila ni binkanni wale na:** The text doesn't give indication about the motive.
*   **D: Siganamɔgɔ tɔgɔ an’a jamu:** The text specifically states ""A tɔgɔ ma dɔn fɔlɔ ɲɛmɔgɔw fɛ"" which means his name is unknown.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**.
"
Tolon ekupu jumɛnw bina ɲɔgɔnkunbɛ Ellis Park maci la?,"The correct answer is **C: Sidafiriki ni Ɔsitirali**

The passage states that ""Springboks ni Ɔsitirali bɛ na ɲɔgɔn sɔrɔ"" in the next match at Ellis Park. ""Springboks"" is another name for the South African team.
"
Springboks ka ɲɔgɔnkunbɛn bina kɛ min maci nata la?,"The correct answer is **A: Ɔsitarali**.

The passage states, ""Tolonkuncɛtolon bɛ na kɛ Ellis Park, Johannesburg kɔnɔ, dɔgɔcɛ wɛrɛ, min senfɛ Springboks ni **Ɔsitirali** bɛ na ɲɔgɔn sɔrɔ."" This clearly indicates that the Springboks will face Australia in their next match.
"
Ninnu jumɛn de kɛra kungo ye dugukolokɔkan-cakɛda ma ni ci senfɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Gyroscope kɔlɔsili**.

The passage states: ""Hali n'a sɔrɔ gyroscope kɔnna ka tunun dugukolokɔkan-cakɛda ka ci senfɛ..."" which translates to ""Even though the gyroscope was lost during the spacewalk..."" This clearly indicates that the loss of the gyroscope was the issue faced by the spacewalk.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun tun ye dugukolokɔkan-cakɛda ka ci ye?","The correct answer is **A: Gyroscope tununen ɲinini**.

The passage states: ""Hali n'a sɔrɔ gyroscope kɔnna ka tunun dugukolokɔkan-cakɛda ka ci senfɛ..."" which translates to ""Although a gyroscope was first lost, the earth-based center started a..."" The rest of the sentence explains what the center did as a result of the lost gyroscope. The most logical answer is that the earth-based center started a search for the lost gyroscope.
"
Ninnu kumasenw jumɛn ko in ka te tiɲɛn ye?,"Based on the original statement (P), the following are true:

*   **A: A tun welela kiri la jamana na AOL jabalaba la (It was a court case with AOL involved):** The text mentions ""Ko welela kiri la Virginie bawo so don min b'a yɛrɛ sɔrɔ bɔlɔlɔkoɲɛnabɔla AOL fɛ ye"" which translates to ""There was a court case in Virginia involving AOL's email provider"".
*   **B: Hakilina dɔ tun dilala (An idea was created):** The text mentions ""Ni y'a siɲɛnfɔlɔ ye hakilina dɔ ka sɔrɔ..."" translating to ""If it was the first time that an idea was found..."" suggesting an idea was indeed created.
*   **C: Sariyatali ka ɲɛsin bɔlɔlɔkankatabikulu ma tun sedonna ni ko in na (Legislation concerning anti-spam was established because of it):** The text specifies that the idea from 2003 was used ""walasa ka bɔlɔlɔkanbatakikulu, n'a bɛ fɔ Spam..."" translating to ""to combat spam"".
*   **D: AOL tun bɛ ka jalaki (AOL was causing accusations):** The text mentions ""cakɛda min ye jalakiliw juguya"" which translates to ""a situation that aggravated the accusations"", indicating that AOL was receiving accusations.

**Therefore, the correct answer is all of the options (A, B, C, and D) are true based on the provided text.**"
Ninnu kumasenw jumɛn bɛ ko nin ɲɛfɔ tigitigi?,"The correct answer is **A: AOL tun jalakila cili ma minw laɲini fɛ** (AOL was suing spammers).

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""...cakɛda min ye jalakiliw juguya"" (a company that was prosecuting spammers) and ""...kɔli ciili ma minw ma a laɲini..."" (sending emails to people who didn't ask for them).
* **A accurately reflects this.** AOL was prosecuting (juguya) people who sent unsolicited emails (minw ma a laɲini).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ko nin tun bɛ bɔlɔlɔkoɲɛnabɔla fila de kun kan (This suit was against two email providers):** The text only explicitly mentions AOL.
* **C: Ko nin tun welela kiri la san 2003 la (This suit was filed in 2003):** The text says 2003 was the year of the law used to fight spam, not necessarily the year this specific suit was filed.
* **D: AOL tun ye ko nin weleli kiri la laɲini (AOL was the one being sued):** The text states AOL was ""prosecuting"" spammers, meaning they were the ones bringing the lawsuit, not being sued.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, munni kulɔbu jumɛn tun ye Vidal ntolatan kɛ sɛsɔn sabanan na?","The correct answer is **A: Sewiye**.

The passage states that Vidal came from ""Sewiye"" before joining Barcelona.
"
Vidal ye ntolatan joli kɛ Barisa ye?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**

The text says ""Kabini a naara Katalan faaba kɔnɔ, Vidal ye ntolatan 49 de kƐ a ka kulubu ye,"" which translates to ""Since arriving in the Catalan capital, Vidal has played 49 matches for his club.""
"
Ekipu jumɛn tun bi ka ntolatan u juguyara ni maci na?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**

The text states: ""A tun be ntolatan kulu ka dunanjigiso la yani ntolatan dɔ cɛ karidon **Bolonia** juguya la."" This translates to ""He was in the football team before a football match against the **Bolonia** rival.""
"
Munna Jarque tun bi ka to dunanjigiso la?,"Based on the provided information in sentence P, the correct answer is:

**A: A tun ye ladegeli kɛ** (He was practicing)

The sentence states ""Jacque tun be ntolatan ɲɛbila ladegeli dɔ la"" which translates to ""Jacque was in a football player training session"".
"
Munna Jakarta cakɛda min ɲɛsinnendo dugukolokɛcogoma ma ladɔniyakunafoni di?,"The correct answer is **D: Yɛrɛyɛrɛ in tun ma se fɔlɔ a tiɲɛnikɛyɔrɔ ma** (The earthquake had not yet reached its destruction zone).

The passage states: ""Tsunamikunafoni ma di, waa Jakarta cakɛda mi ɲɛsin na dugukolokɛcogo kan ko kunbɛni ni ladɔniyakunafoni tɛ na di dugukoloyɛrɛ kan, bawo yɛrɛyɛrɛ in ma se fɔlɔ a tiɲɛnikɛyɔrɔ ma min hakɛ bɛ 6,5 la."" This directly translates to ""A tsunami warning was not issued, and the Jakarta office dealing with earthquakes did not give a warning or advisory on the earthquake, because the tremor had not yet reached its destruction zone which measured 6.5."" This means the office didn't issue a warning because the earthquake's magnitude hadn't reached the threshold requiring a warning.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, dugukoloyɛrɛ tun ye mun kɛ?","The correct answer is **D: 6,5 tiɲɛnikɛyɔrɔ hakɛ**.

The passage states that the earthquake did not reach a magnitude of 6.5 at its epicenter.
"
Ninnu jumɛn kɛra tile ni dolotɔw bɛɛ ka baraw sababu ye?,"The passage states: ""...kalow be ka bara sistƐmu tun be don u ka yelen bɔ ta, rotasiyɔn, ani fosi wƐrƐ.

Ni Rossby hakƐ ka dɔgɔ kɔsɔbƐ, o cogo kelen in na kalo be kisƐya dɔnin ka kƐɲƐni maɲetiki yƐlƐmaliw ye.""

This indicates that ejections, rotation, and some other stuff contribute to the internal dynamo system. Ejections and turbulence work together to determine the Rossby number, which is tied to plasma fluid motion. If the Rossby number is low enough, it weakens the moon's resistance to external magnetic field changes.

Looking at the options:

*   **A: Yelen bɔ ta ni pelasema ji woyoli** - Ejections are mentioned, and plasma fluid motion is linked to Rossby number, which affects the magnetic changes. However, the passage also mentions rotation
*   **B: Rossby hakɛ, rotasiyɔn ani maɲetiki yɛlɛmaliw** - Rossby number, rotation and magnetic changes are included in the passage
*   **C: Rotasiyɔn ni yelen bɔ ta** - Both of these are mentioned
*   **D: Yelen bɔ ta, Rossby hakɛ ani rotasiyɔn** - All three are also mentioned

Based on the passage, the best answer is **D: Yelen bɔ ta, Rossby hakɛ ani rotasiyɔn**, as these all directly influence the moon's magnetic field and resistance to external changes. The ejections and rotation drive the dynamo system, and the Rossby number connects plasma fluid motion and response to external magnetic changes.
"
Kalo ka Rossby hakɛ be dɔn cogo jumɛn?,"The correct answer is **A: Yelen bɔ ta ani munumununi**

The passage states: ""Yelen ni mununmununni be labaara ɲɔngonfƐ ka kalo Rossby hakƐ dɔn"" which translates to ""Brightness and fluctuations are used together to determine the Rossby number of the moon"".
"

The text states: ""...kɛmɛ sarada 31 hakilina ye Australie man kan abada ka kɛ bɛjɛnjamana ye."" This translates to ""31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Kɛmɛsarada 31**
"
"Julie Gillard ka fɔ la, waati jumɛn Ɔsitarali ka kan ka kɛ jamana kelen ye?","The correct answer is **B: Masakɛmuso Elizabeth ka kɔfɛ**

The passage states: ""DɛmɛMinisiriɲɛmɔgɔ Julia Gillard y'a ɲini san 2010 jamanadorogonikalata-yɛrɛkofɔ senfɛ k'a dara a la ko Australie bɛ na kɛ jamana kelen ye Masakɛmuso Elizabeth ka fanga laban na."" This translates to: ""Deputy Minister Julia Gillard requested in the 2010 survey to ascertain whether Australia would become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth's reign.""

Therefore, Julia Gillard envisioned Australia becoming a republic *after* Queen Elizabeth's reign.
"
Jɛkulu juman kelen bɛ kiiri bolo kan?,"The correct answer is **C: Planned Parenthood**.

The passage states that the Komen Foundation adopted a new rule that would prevent them from giving grants to organizations under investigation. The passage then specifies that this new policy affected Planned Parenthood because of an investigation related to their practices.

The passage states that Stearns is the leader of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, which falls under the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun muso ma Swiss muso sɔrɔ?","The correct answer is **B: A fagara** (She was murdered).

Here's why:

The passage states that five people attacked the Swiss woman *to steal her belongings*. While the passage doesn't explicitly say she was murdered, the fact that they were arrested and brought before a judge with charges pending implies a serious crime beyond simple theft, likely resulting in her death.

The other options are wrong because:
*   **A: A bolola fɛn ntarakilenw sɔrɔ la** (To steal her belongings) - This is the *reason* for the attack, not the outcome of what happened to the woman.
*   **C: Binkɛra a kan mɔgɔ 5 fɛ** (Attacked by 5 people) - This describes the attack, but not the ultimate result for the woman.
*   **D: A ka jukakɔnɔ tɛgɛrɛni n’a ka bolola ɔridinatɛri tun soŋara** (Her mobile phone and wallet were stolen) - This describes what was stolen, but not what happened to the woman."
Tayiwani waleɲumandɔnjɔnjɔn dira cakɛda juman kelen ma san 2007?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The passage states: ""Nka sugu la, sannikɛraw ye yɛlɛmaba don  npalankɔnɔɔridinatɛri la, **Asus** kɛni kɔ ka waleɲumadɔnjɔnjɔn sɔrɔ san 2007 Tayiwani...""
"
Npalankɔnɔɔridinatɛri ASUS Eee ye mun ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Bolola ɔridinatɛri**.

The text mentions ""npalankɔnɔɔridinatɛri Asus Eee"", and that it was a topic of discussion. While the term might be unfamiliar, based on context, it's clearly a type of computer. Option C, ""Bolola ɔridinatɛri"" (which translates to ""portable computer"" or ""laptop""), fits the context best. While the phrase might be poorly translated, the essence of the term is still laptop.
"
Jɔni de tun nɔn ye cisɛbɛngafew tununi ye?,"Based on the provided text (P), the correct answer is **A: Nɛgɛjurusiraso baarakɛlaw** (The mining company workers).

The passage states that ""kunu nɛgɛjurusiraso ye yafamaɲini kɛ"" (yesterday the mining company apologized) for losing the documents. This implies that the mining company was responsible for the loss. Therefore, the mining company workers are the ones who were responsible for the documents going missing.
"
"Ka kɛnɛ ni tɛmɛsiran in ye, jɔni ye yafadeli kɛ ka ɲɛsin sɛbɛnw tununni ma?","The correct answer is **D: Obanazawa nɛgɛjuruso**

The passage states ""Kunu nɛgɛjurusiraso ye yafamaɲini kɛ sigidadenw ni kunafonidilaw ye u kɛni ka bɔ..."" This translates to ""Yesterday the mine made an apology to the residents and news reporters for...""

This clearly indicates that the Obanazawa mine (nɛgɛjurusiraso) made the apology.

Waati juman Del Potro tu mako be ka kaman furakɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Sɛti filanan kɔnɔ**.

The passage states that Del Potro needed treatment on his leg during the second set (""Sɛti filanan kɔnɔ"").
"
Tayi-bɛrɛki fɔlɔ jaabi kɛra mun ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Muray y’a jɛ sɛti fɔlɔ kɔnɔ**.

The passage states that Murray won the first set in a tie-break. This directly answers the question of what happened in the first tie-break.
"
"I n’a fɔ a fora tɛmɛsira kɔnɔ cogo min, jɔnin de tun gɛrɛla banabaatɔ la?","Based on the passage provided (P), the correct answer is:

**B: Dɛmɛsinniw**

The passage states: ""Maraba y'a kan to tuguni, """"bii kalanso dɛnmisɛnni kɔrɔbalen dɔw yera ka gɛrɛ banabaatɔ in na."""""" which translates to ""Maraba insisted again, """"today some underprivileged school children were seen approaching the sick person.""""""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, maraba ma hakililatigɛ juman jufɛn fɔ waati min a tun be kumala Texas kaw fɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Baarasira be ka baara ka kɛ ka cogo la.**

The passage states, ""A tilala k'a fɔ, """"Ni ko in ka gɛlɛn. A y'aw hakilila tigɛ ko anka baarasira be ka baara kɛ cogo la."""""" This translates to ""He concluded by saying, """"This situation is difficult. It's important for you to remember that our plan is working effectively."""""" Therefore, option A is the hakilila that Maraba wants the Texans to remember.
"
Kunafonilase ladegeli sira juman sigira sen kan UW sanfɛkalandenw fila fɛ?,"The correct answer is **D: The Onion**.

The passage states that ""Waatijan ka kɔn Daily Show ni The Colbert Report ɲɛ, Heck ni Johnson carili dɔ fɛɛrɛ sigi min ye kunafoniw ni kunafonilase ladegi..."" and then goes on to describe The Onion as a major kunafonicariladegisoba. This indicates that The Onion is the kunafonilase ladegeli sira that was established.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, nin fɛnw juman kelen te The Onion kunafonicariladegisoba kɔnɔ?","Based on the passage, the following are listed as part of The Onion's satirical offerings:

*   Bolonɔndilanso (News in Briefs)
*   Bɔlɔlɔsoba (Web Site)
*   Diɲɛɲɛdɔngafekura (New World Atlas)

The passage does *not* explicitly mention ""Ja dɔ"" (A picture/photo) as being a specific type of content that The Onion produces. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: Ja dɔ**
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de tun be ka kɔlɔsi polisiw fɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Downing Street dodada**.

The passage states that the demonstration was ""ɲƐsin dodaba ma min kɔlɔsilen tun be Downing Street polosiw fƐ, minisiri ɲƐmɔgɔ ka fama sigiyɔrɔ"" meaning it was aimed at a demonstration overlooked by the police at Downing Street.
"

Mun ye tiɲɛ ye Dr. Ehud Ur ka ɲinini kɛlen kan?,"The correct answer is **A: A be se ka kɛ jaabiyaw te na mɔgɔw nafa minw ni sukarobana suguya 1 ye u minɛ kaban** (It is possible that the answers will not benefit people who already have type 1 diabetes).

Here's why:

The passage states, ""I nafɔ dɔnnibajolen wƐrƐw, ale ma da ala ka fɔ ko sukarobana  bena se ka furakƐ ka a ban, kƐrƐnkƐRƐNnenyala nin jaabiya ninnu te mɔgɔw kofɔ  minw ni sukarobana suguya 1 ye u ninƐ kaban."" This translates to: ""Other researchers claim, he is not confident that diabetes can be cured, especially these answers do not refer to people who already have type 1 diabetes.""

This directly supports option A.  The other options are either contradicted or not directly supported by the passage.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Dr. Ur dalen tɛ mun na?","The correct answer is **C: Dɔnnibajolen wɛrɛw hakilina ka ɲɛsin bana in kɛnɛyali ma (Other scientists' ideas about curing the disease)**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""I nafɔ dɔnnibajolen wƐrƐw, ale ma da ala ka fɔ ko sukarobana bena se ka furakƐ ka a ban..."" This translates to ""Despite other scientists, he doesn't believe that diabetes can be cured...""
*   Therefore, Dr. Ur is skeptical of the idea (or the claims of other scientists) that diabetes can be cured.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ni jaabi ninnu bɛ mɔgɔ kofɔ minw ni sukarobana Suguya 1 b’u la (That these answers concern people who have Type 1 diabetes)**: This is something Dr. Ur mentions as a specific limitation to potential treatments; he acknowledges that treatments are *especially* unlikely for those with Type 1 diabetes.
*   **B: N’a bɛ se kɛnɛya (If it can be cured)**: The passage makes it clear that Dr. Ur doubts diabetes *can* be cured.
*   **D: Bana tɛ ɲina minnu na n’olu kɛnalen bɛ na to (The disease does not go away in those who are cured)**: This doesn't make sense."
Ninnu laseli jumɛnw tɛ CG4684 pankurun ka kasara bugunnatigɛ tigitigi?,"The correct answer is **C: Pankurun ye a lajɛ ka jigin siyɛn saba sani kasara in ka kɛ**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""Twin Otter tun ye a lajƐ ka jigin Kokoda kunun ni pankurun konpaɲin CG4684 ka pankurun PNG ye, ɲa a tun ye a sɔrɔ a tiɲƐ siyƐn kelen. Miniti tan ɲɔgɔn sani a ka jigin dugu ma a gƐrƐ ko filanan la, a tunura.""
*   This translates to: ""The Twin Otter attempted to land in Kokoda with the PNG CG4684 plane, even though it had one previous failure. About ten minutes before landing a second time, it crashed.""

*   Thus the plane only attempted to land a maximum of two times, but no mention of a third landing. This proves that option C is not supported in the text, and is the correct answer."
Sababu jumɛn ye CG4684 pankurun jiginni mafɔ?,"Based on the provided passage, none of the answer options directly explain why the CG4684 plane crashed. The passage mentions the plane crashed, but doesn't provide the exact cause. The passage focuses on the difficulty of reaching the crash site and the search efforts.

However, since the crash location was difficult to access ""ɲa a tun ye a sɔrɔ a tiɲƐ siyƐn kelen,"" the closest answer is implied by ""A: Jiginni yɔrɔ tun lasɔrɔ ka gɛlɛn"" (The crash site was difficult to locate). This indirectly suggests that the difficult terrain might have contributed to the crash or hindered rescue efforts after the crash.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: Jiginni yɔrɔ tun lasɔrɔ ka gɛlɛn** (The crash site was difficult to locate).
"
"Ka da tɛmɛsira in kan, ninnu laseli minnu bɛ kuma Franciszek Kowal ka ko tɛmɛnenw baro kan jumɛn kelen ye tiɲɛ ye?","Based on the passage provided:

*   The passage states, ""Sofiɲɛbilada kelen nana kari a tɔla"". This means ""One tire finally broke"".
*   It also mentions that people were hitting seats with bottles, but the tires weren't breaking. Franciszek Kowal witnessed one of the tires breaking.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: A sera ka sofiɲɛbilada dɔ kari** (He managed to break a tire)."
Munna a ka gɛlɛn ka Funtenimayɔrɔ sanfiɲɛ Danielle kɔlɔlɔ dɔn?,"The correct answer is **C: Sanfiɲɛ in ni dugukolo ka na cɛ ka jan kojugu** (The hurricane is very far from land).

The passage states ""Ikomi sanfiyɛn yɔrɔ ka jan dugukolo la, a ka gɛlɛn ka kɔlɔlɔ dɔn Etasini walima Caraïbes."" which directly translates to ""Because the hurricane is far from land, it is difficult to predict its path for the United States or the Caribbean.""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye,ninnu laseli jumɛnw minnu bɛ boli Funtenimayɔrɔ Sanfiɲɛ Danielle ka ni ciyɛnw tɛ?","The correct answer is **D: A ka surun dugukolo ka na la.**

Here's why:

*   **A: A kɔlɔlɔ Karayibu kan na la, o ma dɔn** - The passage states ""a ka gɛlɛn ka kɔlɔlɔ dɔn Etasini walima Caraïbes,"" which implies it is difficult to know whether it is heading to the Caribbean. The text supports this statement.
*   **B: A bɔra Atlantik Kɔkɔji kɔnɔ** - The passage states ""bɔra kɔgɔjii'kɔgɔduguyanfan na"" (bɔra Atlantik Kɔgɔji kɔnɔ). The text supports this statement.
*   **C: A bɛ se ka bonya ka kɛ funufunu ye** - The passage states ""Ŋɛɲininikɛlaw ka bɔ National Hurricane Center ko Danielle bɛ bonya ka kɛ funufunu ye Araba don,"" which directly states the hurricane is expected to strengthen into a hurricane. The text supports this statement.
*   **D: A ka surun dugukolo ka na la** - The passage says, ""Ikomi sanfiyɛn yɔrɔ ka jan dugukolo la, a ka gɛlɛn ka kɔlɔlɔ dɔn Etasini walima Caraïbes."", implying the opposite; because it is far from land, it is difficult to predict whether it will affect the US or Caribbean.

Therefore, statement D is the only one that is *not* true according to the text."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, fɛn jumɛn laɲininen don min kan ka kɛ ni bana in ye sani a ka kɛ bana ye min bɛ cari dunia bɛɛ kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **A: A kaɲi ka mɔgɔ dɔnni faga**.

The passage explicitly states that research indicates the disease must ""kill human awareness"" before it spreads globally. This is the same as ""A kaɲi ka mɔgɔ dɔnni faga"" (It must kill human awareness).
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, janya hakɛ jumɛn tun bɛ Fujian ni Fiyɛnkolonba Tyfɔn cɛ?","The passage states: ""Utikalo tile 9 su; Markot ɲɛ tun be kilomɛtɛrɛ biwolowila hakɛ la ani Sini jamana marabolo Fujian cɛ. A jateminɛnna ko Fiyɛnkolonba Tyfɔn be ka ɲɛsin Siniwa jamana ma km tannikele lɛrɛ la.""

This means that at that time, Markot (likely a reference point) was 200 kilometers away from Fujian. The typhoon was expected to hit China at a speed of 11 km/hour. The passage doesn't directly state the distance between Fujian and the typhoon. However, it implies the typhoon is approaching China, which Fujian is a part of. The 11 km refers to the speed, not the distance. The distance is implicitly linked to the speed at which it is moving towards it.

Since the options don't provide a calculation to factor in the speed of the typhoon, and there is no direct distance in the passage, the most plausible answer from the options provided is 11km since that is the only figure explicitly linked to the Typhoon in the passage. This is, however, an inference, so this might be a flawed question.

Therefore, the best answer from the choices provided is:

B: Kilomɛtɛrɛ 11
"
Jɔnni ye George W. Bush fo ka kɛɲɛ ni a kan nani ye Asia gun kan?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng ani Lee Hsien Loong**.

The passage states that Bush was first greeted by Singapore's Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng. He then discussed trade and counterterrorism with Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Thus, both Wong Kan Seng and Lee Hsien Loong met with George W. Bush.
"
Waati jumɛn jamanaɲɛmɔgɔ kuma na jago yiriwali kan Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka tugu a ka furancɛ kalata ciliw la (After his week-long trip).**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Dɔgɔkun kelen furancɛ kalata ciliw  kɔfɛ, Bush kumana jama dɔ fɛ jago  yiriwali kan Asia"" which directly translates to ""After the week-long trip, Bush spoke to a crowd about trade development in Asia.""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni sɛbɛn nin ye, ninnu jumɛn kelen ye ɲɛmɔgɔw ka kuntilena ba ye?","The correct answer is **D: Ka tɛrɛnwotorow ka jamakafoba ko ban** (To facilitate/ease the general use of the trams).

Here's why:

* **P** states the reason for buying more trams: ""...walasa ka jamakafoba nɔgɔya"" which translates to ""in order to facilitate/ease the general use of trams.""
* The other options are not the primary *reason* for the purchase, they are side effects or numbers mentioned in the text.

Therefore, **D** best reflects the main goal (kuntilena ba) described in the text.
"
Cikan jumɛn fɔra maraɲɛmaw fɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: U y'a ɲaniya ka tɛrɛnwotoro wɛrɛw den 300 san**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tirɛnwotorow 300 fara la 1.300 kan walasa ka jamakafoba nɔgɔya"" which translates to ""300 tɛrɛnwotoro were bought in addition to 1,300 in order to simplify the community""

Therefore, the question being ""what was the order given to the marayɛmaw?"" The answer is clearly ""to buy 300 more tɛrɛnwotoro"".
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kunnafoni jumɛn dɔnnen do?","The correct answer is **A: Bagabagali kɛli hakɛ jigina**.

Here's why:

    *   This translates to: ""It says, 'Nothing proves definitively that settling occurred due to an attack. However, the fact remains that even if the disturbances have decreased, it doesn't mean the disturbances have stopped completely.'""

    *   This tells us that the disturbances (bagabagaliw) have decreased (dɔgɔya), but not stopped completely. This means ""Bagabagali kɛli hakɛ jigina"" - ""The frequency of disturbances has decreased"" - is a true and supported statement from the passage.

Let's analyze why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bagabagali foyi tɛ yen bilen:** (There are no disturbances at all anymore) - The passage explicitly states that the disturbances have not stopped completely, so this is incorrect.
*   **C: Sigi kɛlen do binkani dɔ kan:** (Settling occurred due to an attack) - The passage begins by saying nothing PROVES definitively that settling occurred due to an attack.
*   **D: Kunnafoni y'a sɛbɛntiya ko binkani in bɛna juguya kosɔbɛ:** (The information documents that the attack will become much worse) - The passage makes no mention of the attack becoming worse.

**Therefore, the only answer that is supported by the information in the passage is A.**"
Ninnu kumasen jumɛn ka ɲɛsin lagosiliw ma tɛ tiɲɛn ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Ɲɛmɔgɔya so jɛkulu tun kɛra jaabi ye lagosiliw ma**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Jɛkulu in tun ye Martelly ka jaabi ye fanga taabolo lagosila jɛnsɛnnenw ma minnu daminɛna Ɔkutɔburukalo la."" This translates to: ""This group was Martelly's response to widespread protests against his power structure, which began in October.""
The other options can be inferred as true from the excerpt."

The text states: ""Kalo tɛmɛnen ɲɛmɔgɔya so jɛkulu dɔ ye laɲini gɛlɛma kɛ ko CEP ka baara bila kɛ fɔlɔ..."" This translates to ""Last month, a group from the presidential palace made a strong request for the CEP to stop working first...""

Kɔkɔjikurun in tun bɛka taa min waati min tiɲɛnnin kɛra? ,"The text says ""kɔkɔjikurun Avenger tun be aka sira fɛ ka taa Puerto Princesa Palawan"".

**C: Palawan**
"
Ninnu jumɛn kelen tiɲɛn ye ka ɲɛsin kɔkɔjikurun in ma min fɔra tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ?,"Let's analyze the given passage (P) and the answer options:

*   **P: ""Ameriki Kɔkɔji kɛlɛbolo fana tun y'a fɔ ko a tun be sɛgɛsɛgɛli la ni ko in na. U y'a fɔ kuma dɔ la tugunni """" kulu in be ɲinini baara la ka kɔkɔjikurun sama k'a labɔ fɛɛrɛ ɲuma la.""""

A kalifala Ameriki Kɔkɔjikɛlɛbolo kulu wolowilanan la min dagalen do Sasebo kɔnɔ, Nagazaki, Zapɔn jamana la.""**

Now let's consider the options:

*   **A: A tun bɛ ka taa Puerto Princesa** - The text states ""Dugujukɔrɔfɛn ɲinini lagosili kɛ kɔkɔjikurun Avenger tun be aka sira fɛ ka taa Puerto Princesa Palawan"" which translates to ""The geological survey submarine Avenger was on its way to Puerto Princesa Palawan"". Therefore, this statement is TRUE.

*   **B: A dagalen do Palawani** - The text says the sub was *going to* Palawan, not that it was stationed there. So this is FALSE.

*   **C: Dugujukɔrɔfɛnw ɲinini kɔkɔjikurun do** - The text says, ""Dugujukɔrɔfɛn ɲinini lagosili kɛ kɔkɔjikurun Avenger"" which identifies it as a geological survey submarine. Thus, this is TRUE.

*   **D: A tun kalifala Ameriki Kɔkɔjikɛlɛbolo wolonfilanan ma** - The text states, ""A kalifala Ameriki Kɔkɔjikɛlɛbolo kulu wolowilanan la,"" meaning it was assigned to the Seventh Fleet. So, this is TRUE.

Since the request is to choose only one correct answer, we need to determine the most precise answer that is directly stated in the text. Options A, C, and D are all true according to the text. Option A is the most complete and direct statement that can be derived from the passage.

Therefore, the best answer is:
**A: A tun bɛ ka taa Puerto Princesa**"
Jɔn ye tun ye kuma lase ka ɲɛsin Ameriki kɛlɛdenw ma?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The passage states: ""Ameriki Jamana ɲɛma Donald Trump, kunafoni di dɔ senfɛ, ye laseli kɛ ko Ameriki kɛlɛ cɛw bena segin ka Siri dugukolo kan."" This directly translates to ""American President Donald Trump, in a statement, announced that American soldiers would return to Syrian territory.""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni kumasen nin ye, ninnu jamana jumɛn kelen k'a bɛ jɔ ni kɛlɛ denw minɛninw ladonni ye?","The correct answer is **D: Turki**.

This translates to: ""Turkey will stand firm on the issue of ISIS fighters captured whom European countries refuse to repatriate, according to the information, they should go back home.""

Therefore, Turki (Turkey) claims to be standing firm on taking responsibility for the captured ISIS fighters.
"
Mun de jateminɛna ka kɛ kasara in nɔ ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Fitinɛkɔlɔlɔ**.

The passage states: ""Pankurunkasara kɛra kuluma yɔrɔ dɔ sanfɛ, min jateminɛna ka kɛ **futinɛkɔlɔlɔ** ye."" This directly translates to ""A bunker collapse occurred above a mine area, which was estimated to be a **mine collapse**.""

The question asks what was *estimated* to be the cause of the collapse, and the passage says it was estimated to be a mine collapse. Therefore, B is the correct answer.
"
Yala kasara tun kɛra yɔrɔ sugu jumɛn na?,"The answer is **D: Kulumanyɔrɔ**

The passage states ""Pankurunkasara kɛra kuluma yɔrɔ dɔ sanfɛ"" which translates to ""The pankurun explosion happened on top of a kuluma location"". Therefore, the explosion happened at a kuluma location.
"
Ɲɛmɔgɔw bɛ ka mun de jigiya ka kɛ jikasara jaabi ye?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

"
Barazi dilanni ye nɔ bila ninnu jumɛn de la kudayi?,"The correct answer is **A: Cɛncɛntonw**.

The passage states that the construction of the dam in 1963 stopped the flow of water needed for making ""cɛncɛnton ni jijɔyɔrɔniw,"" and that leaders hope to restore the ""cɛncɛnjɛnsɛn"" (essentially, the same as ""cɛncɛnton"") in the future. This clearly indicates a permanent impact on the production of ""cɛncɛnton.""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔn tun ye Ameriki jamana kunnafoni binkanniwalew kan minnu bɛ se ka kɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Somali jatigɛ walekɛlaw**.

The passage states that the US embassy in Nairobi issued a warning about ""jatigɛwalekɛraw minnu bɛ Somali"" (terrorists based in Somalia) planning attacks in Kenya and Ethiopia.
"
Ninnu kumasen jumɛn be jatigɛwale kɛlaw ka binkanni labɛnni ko ɲɛfɔ tigitigi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka mugujuguw ci dugu nafamanyɔrɔw la jamana fila kɔnɔ**

Here's why:

*   The passage states the threat is targeted towards **Kenya and Ethiopia** (two countries).
*   It also specifically mentions that militants plan to target **important locations**.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate description of the planned attacks."
"Mɔgɔ ninnu na, jɔn tɛ soronadonbagaw ye?","The correct answer is **A: Petros Mantouvalos**.

Here's why:

*   The passage clearly states that Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos are soronadonbaw (fraudsters).
*   Makis Triantafylopoulos is described as a kunnafonidila (journalist).
*   Petros Mantouvalos is described as a sariyatigi (lawyer).

Therefore, Petros Mantouvalos is the only one who is explicitly not a soronadonba (fraudster)."
Ninnu jama kulu jumɛn ma kofɔ minnu sen bɛ kunmasuliko la min kɛra Gɛrɛki sariyatigɛjɛkulu la?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Kiiritigɛlaw**.

Here's why:

*   The text mentions that the ""Ola kunmasuliko ba dɔ kɛra Gɛrɛsi jamana sariyatigɛjƐkulu la ni sariyatan kow kofɔli ye kiiritigɛlaw ye, soronalidɔnbagaw ani ladilikɛlaw fɛ san tɛmɛnenw la."" This indicates that **kiiritigɛlaw** (judges) were involved in the accusations related to the Greek judiciary.

*   The text also states, ""O ka bɔ a la, kiiritigɛla ɲɛmɔgɔ Evangelos Kalousis datugura ka da a kan a nɔ yera yuruguyurugu ni jogo kolon na,"" which further implicates judges (specifically, a chief judge) in corruption.

The other options are mentioned in the text as either making accusations or being involved in the reporting of the accusations, but the focus of the accusations themselves is on the **kiiritigɛlaw**."
Cɛluda joli tununa Ɛndujamana fɛ?,"The text says ""India dron ye boli 36 kɛ ka cɛluda 7 labila"". This means India lost 7 wickets.

Therefore the answer is **B: 7**.

"
Ninnu jumɛn tun tɛ Adam Cuerden ka jigilatigɛ kun ye?,"Let's break down the prompt and the question.

The prompt P summarizes Adam Cuerden's criticism of Wales (presumably Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia). Cuerden's complaints are:

1.  Wales has been a burden since the beginning.
2.  Wales initially acted as if things were legally sound.
3.  Wales acted as if listening to them, then undermined their power.
4.  The controversy is about a new policy regarding sexually explicit content on a site with millions of public domain images.

The question Q asks which of the given options was NOT a point of Cuerden's criticism.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Siti ka sariya kura min talikɛ cɛnimusoya fɛnw (The site's new rule regarding sexually explicit content):** While the overall context of the disagreement involves such a rule, Cuerden's *direct* criticisms were about Wales' behavior, not the policy itself.
*   **B: Peyi de Galli ka seko bɔli ko (Peyi de Galli's power undermining):** This is a restatement of ""Wales acted as if listening to them, then undermined their power.""  So, this *was* a criticism.
*   **C: Lamɛli baliya Wales fɛ (Wales' refusal to listen):** This is also a restatement of a portion of Cuerden's criticism: Wales acted as if listening.
*   **D: Nkalontigɛ ka ɲɛsin seko bɔli kun ma (Criticism regarding the undermining of power):** A more direct translation is that the undermining of power was the problem.

Therefore, the only option that doesn't directly reflect one of Cuerden's stated criticisms is **A**. While the policy is the backdrop for the disagreement, Cuerden's words focused on Wales' actions, not the policy itself.

**Therefore, the correct answer is A.**
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni sɛbɛn nin ye, mun de jɔsira ka bɔ siti kan?","The correct answer is **B: Cɛnimusoya fɛnw** (Pornographic content).

The passage states that the decrease in site area is due to the writing of a time-limited document on the management of content related to **talikɛ cɛnimusoya kɔnɔfɛnw** (explicit content related to cɛnimusoya) on a site that contains many publicly available images. Cɛnimusoya is a concept of gender relation which is not equal to the concept of pornography.

So the answer is B.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni sɛbɛn nin ye, ninnu jumɛn Amir Khan tɛ dɛmɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Ka musokɛlɛkɛlaw don Olɛnpik**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""n hakilila musow mankan ka kɛlɛ kɛ"" which translates to ""I believe in women speaking out"". This suggests he supports women's opinions and voices.
*   The passage mentions he wants to improve British athletes' performance in the Olympics in London.

Therefore, the only option he doesn't directly support based on the passage is allowing women boxers into the Olympics.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Amir Khan bɛna ninnu jumɛn dɛmɛ hali n’a hakilina tɛ?","The passage says Amir Khan supports women's boxing despite personally having reservations about women fighting. He also said he wanted to improve British sports leading up to the London Olympics.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: Muso kɛlɛkɛlaw (Women boxers)**. He supports them even though he personally doesn't like the idea of women fighting. While C is related, the passage specifically states he will support *women boxers*.
"
Peter Lenz sara tuma jumɛn?,"The correct answer is **C: Dɔgɔtɔrɔsola**.

The passage states ""dɔkɔtɔrɔsodeni dɔ la a saara yɔrɔ minna kɔfɛ"" which means he died after being taken to the hospital.
"
Xavier Zayat ye jɔn ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Tulonkɛɲɔgɔn wɛrɛ**

The passage states ""A ka labɛn senfɛ Lenz bɔra a ka mɔtɔ kan ka bin, ni ka gosi a tulonkɛɲɔgɔn Xavier Zayat fɛ,"" which means ""During his race Lenz fell off his motorcycle and was hit by his teammate Xavier Zayat."" This clearly indicates that Zayat was a teammate (tulonkɛɲɔgɔn) of Lenz.
"
Cogoya jumɛn na panikɛla hamitɔ bɛ se ka faamuyali sɔrɔ pankuru kɔnɔna marise cogo la?,"The correct answer is **C: Ni taamakɛla bɛ hami bolifɛn sugu bɛɛ kɔnɔdonni na.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that *some* people find that understanding the *components* of a panic attack (what's happening in their body and mind) helps them fight fear.
*   Option C directly reflects this: if someone understands all aspects of their panic attack, they are better equipped to manage their fear.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ni taamakɛla be maloya n’a ka siran ye (If the person is ashamed of their fear):** Shame would likely hinder understanding and coping.
*   **B: N’u ka panni hami bɛ munumunu dɔnbali siran dafɛ (If the person's panic is due to unknown fear):** A panic attack can occur without a known fear.
*   **D: N’u ka jɔrɔ ju bɔra jatigɛwale dɔ la min ni panni tɛ ɲɔgɔnsira la (If they have deeply rooted trauma that is unrelated to panic):** While trauma *could* be a factor, the passage focuses on understanding the panic attack itself, not underlying trauma.

Therefore, **C** is the best answer because it directly aligns with the passage's explanation of how understanding a panic attack's components can help manage fear."
"Ka da ni tɛmɛsira in kan, paseko dɔnni bɛ taamakɛla o bɛ mun de laban kɛ?","Based on the passage provided, the answer is **D: Ka pankuruso ka baarakɛyɔrɔ ka siti lajɛ**

The passage states ""...ɲininli jaabi sumani ye ɲɔgɔna be sara kaɲɛ ani ka pankuruso baarakɛyɔrɔ ka ɛntɛrɛnɛti siti lajɛ fɛnɛ yani marali cɛ kabila."" This translates to something like ""...limited search results should be compared well and the company's website should be checked before making a travel decision."" Therefore, reviewing the company's website is directly supported by the text as something travelers should do.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, dugutaalaw k’an ka mun de kɛ walasa ka pankuru pase bɛ la daduman sɔrɔ?","Based on the passage, the answer is **A: Ka pankuruso ka baarakɛyɔrɔ ka siti lajɛ**.

The passage states: ""...ɲininli jaabi sumani ye ɲɔgɔna be sara kaɲɛ ani ka pankuruso baarakɛyɔrɔ ka ɛntɛrɛnɛti siti lajɛ fɛnɛ yani marali cɛ kabila."" This translates to: ""...a small research answer should match and the password for the bank's website should be checked before the management is transferred completely.""

Therefore, checking the bank's website is presented as a step to take *before* completely transferring management of your account.
"
Tuma jumɛn tɔɲɔgɔn bɛ jaguya ka taa fɛn di ta nɔfɛ?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Nin fɛnw bɛ ka ci inafɔ minɛn tɔgɔ sɛbɛnnen.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Sira kelen min beyi ka cili teliya kun ye ka ci inafɔ minɛn tɔgɔ sɛbɛnlen."" (The only way to speed up delivery is to ship as an express shipment.)

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Nin fɛnw cira donnita pankuru fɛ** (When goods are shipped through customs) - This is mentioned as a slow process, the opposite of speeding up delivery.
*   **B: Ni cakɛda y’a yɛrɛ ka pankuru ta** (When the company uses its own vehicle) - The passage is about how to speed up the delivery of shipping goods not delivery through a company’s vehicle.
*   **D: Nin cili bɛ ka kɛ cakɛdabaw fɛ** (When delivery is handled by business) - This is too general and not mentioned in the context of speeding up delivery."
"Ka da tɛmɛsira kan, Frequent Flyer pankurun cakɛda sugandi tɔn jɛkulu dɔ kɔnɔ, ninnu na jumɛn kan ka kɔn ka kɛ?","Based on the prompt, the best answer is **C: I bɛ taama pankurun cakɛda min bolo ka caya.**

Here's why:

* **The prompt emphasizes maximizing points for travel:** The core idea in the initial prompt focuses on choosing a frequent flyer program strategically to get the most benefits (points) when traveling.
* **Option C directly relates to point accumulation:** Choosing the program you fly most often with ensures you accumulate points within that program, leading to rewards.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Pankurun cakɛda min bɛ kuru caman ni:** The number of travel partners isn't the primary factor. Points accumulation within a *single* program is more important.
* **B: Pankurun cakɛda mun bɛ jɛkulu bɛ la kunbaba kɔnɔ:**  Being part of a larger alliance might offer some benefits, but it's not as crucial as consistently using one airline to accrue points.
* **D: Pankurun cakɛda min bɛna sɔn ka kɛ farankan bɛrɛbɛrɛliw dili la:** This is about credit card offers or promotions, which are secondary considerations. The first goal is to rack up the most points for the airline you already use the most.

**Therefore, the best approach is to stick with the airline you use most frequently (Option C) to maximize point accumulation and get the most out of your frequent flyer membership.**
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛsira ye, jɔn bɛ sɔn ka pankuruta waatibɛ pɔnyin caman di?","The correct answer is **A: Pankurun cakɛda wɛrɛ jɛkulu wɛrɛ kɔnɔ**.

Here's why:

The text (P) says that to maximize potential on the pumpkin patch (pankuru kulu), you need to consider the differences (tɔnɔn minunw) in various times and how a pumpkin does better at different times in a *different* section of the patch (pankuruso dɔ wɛrɛla o kulu kelen kɔnɔ). ""Kulu kelen"" is best translated as ""group.""

This clearly implies seeking out pumpkins in a *different* patch (or at least a *different* section in the patch) and at different times.
* Option A best matches this idea of different pumpkin farms and different ""groups.""

The other options are flawed because:

*   B: Talks about the *same* ""group""
*   C: Talks about the *same* ""group""
*   D: Talks about the *same* ""group""

"
"Ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛsira ye, dusukuntayɔrɔ jumɛn bɛ dugan k’a kɛ dɔlɔ minko juguya sababu ye?","Based on the passage, the answer is **C: Nɛnɛli**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically mentions ""Jama jama camaw be seka sɔrɔ sipiriti kɔnlenw la minunw be seka kɛ metanɔli ye, min be seka fiyɛn nati walima saya ali a fitini minli."" This translates to ""Many people can find spirits containing methanol, which can cause blindness or death, even in small doses.""  ""Nɛnɛli"" most likely refers to blindness as a consequence of drinking alcohol, making it the correct answer.

The other options are less directly linked to the dangers of drinking adulterated alcohol as described in the passage.
"
"Inafɔ a fɔra cogo minna ni tɛmɛsira kɔnɔ, mun de tun be se ka dɔlɔ kɔlɔlɔ juguw baga faga?","The correct answer is **A: Dɔlɔ ni metanɔli ɲagaminni minni**.

The passage states that ""Jama jama camaw be seka sɔrɔ sipiriti kɔnlenw la minunw be seka kɛ metanɔli ye, min be seka fiyɛn nati walima saya ali a fitini minli"" which translates to ""Many people can get spirits containing methanol, which can cause blindness or death even in small amounts."" This clearly indicates that consuming alcohol contaminated with methanol is the cause of the severe consequences.
"
So walɛribaw Amsterdam sow cɛla bɛ min?,"The correct answer is **A: Canal District**.

The passage states: ""...a sow walɛri be jamana so walɛribaw cɛla"" which means ""its houses' value is among the country's most valuable houses"". Then the question asks ""So walɛribaw Amsterdam sow cɛla bɛ min?"" which translates to ""Where are the valuable houses among Amsterdam's houses?"" The passage answers that this is in the Canal District (Grachtengordel).
"
Munna Canal District sungandira ka kɛ UNESCO Diɲɛ Cɛnma Yɔrɔ ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Tariku nin danbe walɛri b’a la**.

The passage states ""Dugu in bɛɛ jiraleno inafɔ UNESCO Diɲɛ Cɛnma Yɔrɔ ko sababu ka k'a ladala ani tariku nafan kelen ye..."" which translates to ""The entire city is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its beauty and historical significance..."" Thus, the key reason for the designation is its historical value and beauty.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jemɛn bɛ ka Phnom Krom lajɛli kɛ fɛn nafama ye?","The passage states: ""Tanpulu yɛlɛ ani nisondiya cogo ani  Tonle Sap Lake lajɛli be kulu yɛlɛ in kɛ fɛn nafama."" This translates to: ""The temple view and the peaceful atmosphere and viewing Tonle Sap Lake make the mountain visit worthwhile.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Ɲɛnafilɛli Tonle Sap sanfɛ (Viewing Tonle Sap Lake)**.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛsira ye, mun diyagoyalen bɛ filɛbagaw kan yaasa ka don Phnom Krom kɔnɔ?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Ka yɛlɛ ka tɛmɛ Yasovarman alabatoso la**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions: *""Tanpulu yɛlɛ ani nisondiya cogo ani Tonle Sap Lake lajɛli be kulu yɛlɛ in kɛ fɛn nafama""* meaning the view from the hill, the temple (built during Yasovarman's reign), and the view of Tonle Sap Lake all make the hill worthwhile. And then the passage mentions the tour to Tonle Sap.

Let's analyze the other options:

*   **B: Siem Reap laminin taama**: The passage mentions Phnom Krom is located 5km southwest of Siem Reap, but it doesn't mention a tour around Siem Reap as a specific attraction related to visiting Phnom Krom.
*   **C: Angkor Pass sɔrɔli**: The passage mentions that Angkor Pass is needed to enter temples (including those inside the Angkor Pass zone), but not to go to Phnom Krom, so it's not directly a reason to visit Phnom Krom.
*   **D: Batɔɔn woyazi Tonle Sap laminin na**: The passage mentions a boat trip on Tonle Sap. But the boat trip is a separate tourist destination, and not a reason to visit Phnom Krom.

"
"Ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn tun be bɛ turisiw bali ka ta bɔ Antarctica la?","The correct answer is **B: Nafa kelen pewu Ross Sea sɛgɛsɛgɛli kɔnɔ**.

Here's why:

*   **The original text (P) mentions that tourist visits are limited to the Antarctic Peninsula, islands, and the Ross Sea.** Option B (Ross Sea sɛgɛsɛgɛli kɔnɔ) directly reflects this limited area for tourism.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   Option A: ""Taama wari ba"" means ""a lot of travel money"" and refers to the high cost of traveling there, which is mentioned in the text.
*   Option C: ""Baara waati min b’a to i bɛ taama Desanburu nin Zanwuye kalo kɔnɔ"" refers to the best work and travel time, which is not the correct answer
*   Option D: ""Faari bɔɲɔgɔnnali hakɛ sigili"" does not align with anything from the text

Therefore, only option B, ""Nafa kelen pewu Ross Sea sɛgɛsɛgɛli kɔnɔ"", accurately answers the question regarding tourist destinations."
Turisi min tun mako donnen do kulukan yɛlɛ la tun bɛ ka Antarctica yɔrɔ jumɛn lajɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Peninsula**.

The passage states: ""mũngĩcerio o Peninsula, islands na Ross Sea"" which translates to ""you can only visit the Peninsula, islands, and Ross Sea"". Therefore, the Peninsula is one of the places that tourists can visit in Antarctica.
"
Lajɛkɛyɔrɔ minunw ye bi kɔn ma teli ka kɛ yɔrɔ jumɛn?,"The correct answer is **C: Yɔrɔ samanen (Abandoned places)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that these historical meeting places are:

*   Found in ""waaticamala duguw walima kanpisiw"" (old towns or campuses).
*   Easier to find than newly constructed meeting places.
*   Considered attractive by many researchers in the current era.

Given this description, the passage is talking about abandoned or historical sites, therefore, the answer is most likely **Yɔrɔ samanen (Abandoned places)**."
Sisan ɲɛɲinlini lajɛlikɛlaw ka teli ka mara min?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Mize dɔ kɔnɔ.**

The passage specifically mentions ""tɔleno mizew kɔnɔ"" (abandoned mines) as a place where these historical artifacts are found. The other options are mentioned but not directly linked to the location of the artifacts being sought.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛsira in ye, jidawolo jumɛn bɛ sɔn ka ɲɛ kosɔbɛ tile kelen lafiya ma?","The text mentions that the beaches of Tamaki Drive, which are in Waitemata Harbor, are not good for swimming. It also mentions that the beaches of North Shore (North Harbour District) are sandy and good for swimming. It also says that the Tamaki Drive beaches are in the vicinity of Mission Bay and St Heliers. Therefore, the best option for swimming is North Harbour District. However, the question is which location is best for **relaxing** on a day off. Mission Bay and St Heliers have shops and are located on beaches. The North Harbour District beaches are better for swimming. Therefore, the best answer is either Mission Bay or St Heliers.

The text specifies ""Icũa cia Tamaki Drive ciĩ thĩinĩ wa Waitemata Harbour, ĩrĩa ĩrĩ thĩinĩ wa icegerera cĩa Mission Bay na St Heliers thĩinĩ wa Central Aukland. Icũa ici rĩmwe nĩikoragwo na andũ aingĩ a nyũmba na ĩna mĩthemba mĩega ya duka ciĩbangite icũainĩ. No wĩthambĩrĩ gotarĩ gaja.""
This says the beaches are near houses and have good shops. So this implies that Mission Bay or St Heliers would be a better option. The passage also mentions that swimming at these beaches isn't as good, but the question is which is better for relaxing. The shops would make St Heliers or Mission Bay a good option.

Because the Tamaki Drive beaches are ""popular with families and has good shops lined along the beach"", the best answer is either Mission Bay or St Heliers.

The question asks which is best for relaxing on a day off. Having shops would make it a more relaxing day.
Because the text states that shops are near both, and these are also near beaches, the best answer is either Mission Bay or St Heliers. I'll choose St Heliers because it is listed first.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: St Heliers
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛsira in ye, nɔnni cogow jumɛn te tɛli ka kɛ lakana kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **C: Central Auckland**.

The passage mentions that the beaches of Tamaki Drive are located within Waitemata Harbour, which is in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers within Central Auckland. The other options refer to beaches in the North Shore area.
"
"Ni tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ yɔrɔ lakalilen tun lajɛtɔ, ninnu jumɛn tun bina jate inafɔ kɔnnen ye?","Based on the provided passage (P), the action that would be considered inappropriate when visiting the mentioned locations is:

**D: Desin cɛnliw sojɔlen dɔ lo**

The passage explicitly states: ""Kana yɔrɔ cɛn nin sɛbɛli walima desin cɛnliw ye sojɔlenw la"" which translates to ""Do not desecrate or deface any structures.""
"

*   The passage states: ""U danbɔɔleno forobakanla, mɔgɔ ma min dilan..."" (They are different from public languages, which people did not create...)

Therefore, the answer is **B: Mɔgɔ ye min dilan** (Which people created). The passage defines artificial languages *by distinguishing* them from natural languages that people haven't created. The best answer among the options provided is therefore B, which points out the opposite of a quality of artificial languages.
"
Nunnu kumasen jumɛn tɛ gɛrɛfɛ kanw lakali tigitigi?,"Based on the provided passage (P), here's the breakdown and the reasoning for the correct answer:

*   **Passage P states:**
    *   Gɛrɛfɛ kanw (lit. 'artificial languages') are language systems designed to make communication easier for people who might have difficulty communicating due to language barriers.
    *   They are distinct from natural languages (forobakanla) or inner languages (kɔnɔna kanw).
    *   They can be used for various communication purposes.

Let's analyze the answer choices:

*   **A: U ye kɔnɔna kanw ye minnu tun labaarala ka kumaɲɔgɔnya nɔgɔya mɔgɔw cɛ minnu be se ka dɛsɛ ka ɲɔgɔn faamuya cogo wɛrɛlama** (They are inner languages that were used to facilitate communication between people who might not be able to understand each other in other ways) - This is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that gɛrɛfɛ kanw are distinct from *kɔnɔna kanw* (inner languages).

*   **B: U ye kanw ye minnu dilan wa u ladilalen fana** (They are languages that were created and also developed) - This is generally true of artificial languages, but it's not the *most accurate* way to describe what differentiates them according to the passage. The passage highlights the **purpose** of easing communication across language barriers as the defining factor.

*   **C: U ye kanw ye minnu ladilana yaasa ka kumaɲɔgɔnya yɔrɔw gɛlɛnmanw lanɔgɔya** (They are languages designed to simplify difficult areas of communication) - This is a very close and a good description. It correctly emphasizes the simplification purpose.

*   **D: K'an dilalenw don minnu fɔli ka ca mɔgɔw minnu tɛ k'an kelɛn fɔ** (They are created things that are often said by people who don't say it the same way) - This doesn't really fit with the focus of the passage.

**Therefore, the best answer is C.** It most accurately reflects the core purpose of gɛrɛfɛ kanw as described in the passage: to make communication easier in situations where language differences create barriers."
"Ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛsira in ye, taamaden tun be se kakan ka sɛgɛsɛgɛ n’a ya sɔrɔ u ka jikuru bɛ bɔ fonɛnɛ fɛ?","The correct answer is **B: Wiza tali laɲininw**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Batɔn woyazikɛlaw baleleno ka bɔ wiza tali laɲininw ma (Benkanw lajɛ)."" This translates to something like ""Travelers were warned against wizardry expeditions (Lake of Benkan).""

Therefore, the passage directly connects travelers and warnings related to wizardry expeditions."
"ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛsira in ye, nin batɔn woyazikɛlaw bɛ funteni bɔ waati kɔnɔ, mun tun be sen ka bali?","The correct answer is **C: Wiza tali laɲininw**.

The passage states: ""Batɔn woyazikɛlaw baleleno ka bɔ wiza tali laɲininw ma (Benkanw lajɛ)."" This translates to ""The group's members were exempt from visa application requirements (list of exceptions)."" Therefore, visa application requirements prevented the group members from traveling.
"
Munna Catalan tun talen do ka caya tamaisiyɛnw kan ani kunafɔniw sen fɛ Barcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: Dugu sariya kan fɔlɔ kun don**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Catalan is an ""official language"" of Barcelona. This means it's prioritized in official contexts, which naturally leads to its prevalence in signage and information.
*   The text states ""tamaisiyɛnw camaw be Catalan dɔrɔn de la bari a sigileno siriya fɛ inafɔ kan dagalen fɔlɔ.""
*   The text states ""Waatibɛɛ kunafɔni Meturo kɔnɔ be Catalan dɔrɔn dela""

The other options are incorrect:

*   A: The passage actually indicates more people understand Spanish.
*   C: The passage does not state Barcelona ka kan mandi do.
*   D: The passage does not state ""Meturo ani jamana yɔrɔ wɛrɛw ka caya sigidenw fɛ minnu bɛ Catalan kan de fɔ""
"
Ninnu kanw jumɛn bɛ itilize waatibɛɛ kunafɔni na Barcelone Meturo fɛ?,"The correct answer is **B: Katalan**.

The passage states: ""Waatibɛɛ kunafɔni Meturo kɔnɔ be Catalan dɔrɔn dela"". This translates to ""All information in the Metro is in Catalan only"".
"
"Ka da ni tɛmɛnsira in ka, ninnu minɛn jumɛn tɛ i nafɔ a dabɔlen don bilan jumanba ni daraka kama?","The correct answer is **D: WiFi tɛliman**

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on design and value/price as key differentiators.** It mentions good design (dilan ɲuman ba), a good value for the price (daraka yɛlɛna), location factors (fɔlɔfɔlɔ so kɔrɔlen nin fɔlɔ so masiriw, dugumakolo desɛnma ani pisini), and amenities (marayɔrɔ waati nisondiya dumuniw walima jiginso dumuni kɛrɛnkɛrɛniye).

* **WiFi is not discussed at all in the passage**. Therefore, the passage does not imply that fast WiFi is crucial for creating a great design and value.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be correct:

* **A: Minɛ kɛrɛnkɛrɛnw yɔrɔ (Specific location):** While the passage does mention location (""Sanfɛ yɔrɔ dan na""), it focuses more on design and value, making this less directly related to the *core* of what makes a B&B successful.
* **B: Fɔlɔ so masiriw dɔrɔn ye (Only First Home amenities):** The passage refers to these types of amenities, so they are related to the design and value that the passage is referring to.
* **C: Kɛnɛma yɔrɔw ladonkoɲuman (Well-appointed outdoor spaces):** The passage refers to these types of amenities, so they are related to the design and value that the passage is referring to.
"
"Ka da ni tɛmɛnsira in ka, ninnu jumɛn te ye ɲɔgɔndan kun yɛrɛyɛrɛ ye B&Bs ka fɛnw ɲumanw cɛ?","Based on the passage, the two primary competitive factors for B&Bs are design and price. Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Diɲɛn laban mansiri (World class facility)** - The passage mentions different facility features (renovated houses, ground design, pool), but it doesn't explicitly state that world-class facilities are a *key competitive factor*. Design is, but ""world-class"" is a subjective level of design.
*   **B: Waati ni waati daraga diliw (Occasional price discounts)** - While price (daraka) is important, the passage focuses on the overall pricing strategy, not occasional discounts. Occasional discounts might be a tactic to affect the 'daraka', but 'daraka' (price) itself is a key factor.
*   **C: Sanfɛ dilan (Superior design)** - The passage directly states that design (dilan) is a primary competitive factor in the limited geography.
*   **D: Dudun dumini ni ji (Breakfast and drinks)** - The passage mentions meals as part of the *price* offering, but not as a separate competitive element. Breakfast is associated with the price, but not specifically design.

Therefore, the best answer is **C: Sanfɛ dilan (Superior design)** because it's explicitly stated in the passage as one of the two main competitive factors."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni sɛbɛn nin ye, ninnu jumɛn tɛna kɛ Beijing san 2022?","The correct answer is **B: Taizicheng sikilkɛ zuye kɛ yɔrɔw**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Taizicheng sikilkɛ zuye kɛ yɔrɔw are *outside* of Beijing, in Zhangjiakou.
*   The other options A, C, and D, the passage clearly says that Beijing will host."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn bɛna kun bɛ Beijing fɛ san 2022?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: Datuguli tulɔnkɔw**. The passage specifically mentions ""Beijing bena dayɛlɛli ani tuguli tulɔnkɔ kun bɛ..."" (Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies...).
"
Jɔn bɛ farati danna ka kumasɛbɛfɔlila giripu sɔrɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: Kɔnɔlajɛlaw**.

The passage states ""Kɔnɔlajɛlaw fɛnɛ be faratila"" which translates to ""Inspectors of birds, their work is dangerous"". This directly indicates that bird inspectors are at risk.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu kumasen jumɛnw bɛ mura bana ɲɛfɔ tigitigi?","Let's analyze each option against the provided text (P):

*   **A: Siyɛ baarakɛbagaw dɔrɔn de ye mura bana sɔrɔ (Only bats are infected with the flu)** The text states ""Mɔgɔ minɛnw camaw be siyɛ baarakɛ"" (Many affected are bats), but it *doesn't* say only bats are infected. Other animals can be infected, and the text says that some humans were infected. So, this is incorrect.

*   **B: A ɲɔgɔnko caman yera adamadenw na ka tɛmɛn kɔnɔw kan (More cases appeared in humans than in birds)**. The text states ""Hakɛ min ka dɔgɔ nin ka bakelen ye yera adamadenw la"" (A small number of cases appeared in humans). The text does not say that more cases appeared in humans than birds, so this is incorrect.

*   **C: Kɔnɔlajɛlaw bɛ faratila ka banakisɛ sɔrɔ (Poultry farmers are at risk of contracting the virus)** The text states ""kɔnɔlajɛlaw fɛnɛ be faratila"" (Poultry farmers are at risk). This correctly reflects information from the text.

*   **D: Minnu tun yera adamadenw na bɛɛ labana sayala (All of those that appeared in humans eventually died)** The text says ""nka o dɔw labana sayala"" (but some of them eventually died), *not* all. So, this is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**.
"
White Sea-Baltic Canali bɛ tugu ɲɔgɔnna?,"The correct answer is **C: Ocean Arctic ani Balitic Sea**

The passage states: ""White Sea - Baltic Canal be Artic Ocean ani Baltic Sea tuguɲɔgɔna"" which translates to ""White Sea - Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea"".
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, bolimafɛn jumɛnna pasipɔriw bɛ seka fara ɲɔgɔn kan walasa bolimafɛn kɔnɔmɔgɔw kana jɔ?","The answer is **B: Sufɛ tɛrɛnw**

The passage states ""Sufɛ tirɛnw minunw dabɔla sunɔkɔ kama, tirɛ bolila be seka pasipɔriw faraɲɔgɔnkan walalsa i ka sunɔgɔ kana tikɛ"" which translates to ""Soft tires are made for sleeping, the tire holder can overlap passports to prevent your sleep from being disturbed"". This indicates that *sufɛ tirɛnw* (soft tires) are the bolimafɛnw that can overlap passports.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, waati jumɛn i ka karididantite bɛ se ka sɛgɛsɛgɛ Furɔntiyɛri tirɛw dɔw la?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: Tirɛ boli tɔ**.

This translates to ""At some borders, tire checks are done when the tire is bald and you should keep your ID handy so that you can be asked for it in one of these tire issues."" This indicates that ID may be inspected when the tires are bald.
"
Ninnu gɛlɛya jumɛnw de bɛ se ka sɔrɔ kosɛbɛ ni i sigilen bɛ Singapore jimayɔrɔ belebelebala?,"The passage describes Singapore as a safe and convenient place to shop. However, it contrasts this with a tropical location (""jimayɔrɔ belebelebala"") near the equator, characterized by frequent rain (funtɛni) and intense sun.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Ka bin i kan (Falling on you):** While rain can make things slippery, this isn't the primary or most prominent challenge described.
*   **B: Ka bali butiki taalilila (Being prevented from going to the store):** The passage implies difficulty due to weather, not necessarily a complete inability to go to stores.
*   **C: Ka tɔrɔ funtɛni carini fɛ (Suffering constantly from the rain):** This directly reflects the passage's mention of frequent rain (funtɛni).
*   **D: Ka tunu (To get lost):** Nothing in the passage implies getting lost.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C: Ka tɔrɔ funtɛni carini fɛ (Suffering constantly from the rain)**.

Jɔnni tun bɛ fɛ ka Alinaɲi patiseriw dunni dabila?,"Based on the provided text, there's no direct mention of who should *avoid* German pastries. However, the passage *does* highlight ingredients like almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, and other tree nuts as common components.

Therefore, the most logical answer is:

**A: Mɔgɔ min ni alɛrizi kolow juguman bɛ ɲɔgɔnna** (Someone who has a severe nut allergy)

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Mɔgɔ min bɛ dezɛri nafamaw fɛ** (Someone who prefers healthy desserts): While some might see pastries as less ""healthy,"" there's no indication they should avoid them completely.
*   **C: Mɔgɔ min tɛ sokola fɛ** (Someone who doesn't like chocolate): Many German pastries do *not* contain chocolate.
*   **D: Ksa fɛgɛmani duman ani kasa mɛnta duman kadi mɔgɔ min ye (A person who likes the taste of lemon and mint)**: This person can still eat the dessert.

So, the presence of nuts makes option A the most appropriate answer.
"
Kɛfɛn jumɛn jatelen don waati ni waati fɛn la Alinaɲi patiseriw la?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Pomu**.

The text states: ""nin pate dilani ye nin pomu ye san mumɛ bɛɛ kɔnɔ"" which translates to ""this pate preparation is with apples all year round"". This clearly indicates that apples (pomu) are a common ingredient used in German pastries throughout the year.
"
"Ka da nin tɛmɛnsira in ka, ninnu jumɛn tɛ fɛnyamariyalen ye duguta musaga la?","The correct answer is **D: Ka dɔbɔ dumini ni siyɔrɔ musaga la (Reducing food and shelter costs)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on finding a job while studying or seeking ways to reduce expenses to manage finances more effectively.** Options A, B, and C directly relate to these themes.

*   **Option D doesn't directly align with the passage's emphasis on income generation or expense reduction strategies related to work or studies.** While reducing food and shelter costs is a general way to save money, the passage's context is specifically about balancing studies/work with financial needs. Therefore, it is the least relevant."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔn tun bɛ seka gɛlɛya sɔrɔ dugutaga waati musaga fitinini ye?","The passage says that these techniques aim to improve the *efficiency* (speed and accuracy) of *gathering* and *evaluating* information, ultimately leading to faster and more accurate decisions, especially when resources are scarce.

Of the choices, **A: Mɔgɔ min bɛ gɛlɛya kun bɛ (A person who is looking for a solution to a problem)** best fits. The passage refers to people that are ""trying to make a decision."" Thus, one can assume that they are trying to find a solution to their problem.

Therefore, the answer is **A**.

Ninnu kumasen jumɛnw tɛ ɲɛfɔli kɛ tigitigi Mariyɔn ni Fairmond sira boli cogo cɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Boli teliya hakɛw sigili ka suma**.

The other options are all mentioned/implied in paragraph P:

*   **A:** `Sirafurancɛ Point Marion ani Fairmont ni ɲɔgɔncɛ de ye sira boli cogo gɛlɛmaba ye Buffalo-Pittsburgh siraba sanfɛ` - this suggests a long road stretch.
*   **B:** `sira fitiniw, ani sirafaran tileninw be fan bɛɛ` - this indicates the narrowness of the roads.
*   **D:** `Kabakoko kɔni, nɛgɛjuru sira fagan ka bɔn yan ka sira yɔrɔ tɔw camaw kan, misalila, the Pennsylvania Wilds.`- this states that paved road is less common in other areas."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni sɛbɛn nin ye, nin jumɛn ka kɛn ka dabɔ yɛrɛyɛrɛ bolimafɛn bolilaw ka boli la Buffalo-Pittsburg siraba kan?","The correct answer is **D: Ka siraba gilalenw caman yeli**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""yɛlɛ ka jigi garo garolen, sira fitiniw, ani sirafaran tileninw be fan bɛɛ"" which translates to: ""steep hills, narrow roads, and winding roads are everywhere.""  This directly implies the existence of many winding roads.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka koron sira falen kan:** While the passage mentions ""sirafaran tileninw"" (winding roads), it doesn't explicitly say that following the road is confusing.
*   **B: Nɛgɛjuru sira baara caya sɔrɔbaliya:** The passage states nɛgɛjuru sira fagan ka bɔn yan, meaning that while it may be a problem on other parts of the road, it isn't here.
*   **C: Ka tɛliya ka sirafara ta:** The passage actually advises the opposite, to keep a low speed and respect the speed limit.

Ninnu jumɛn ma jagoya ka bolili kulufulancɛɛ jira sanfɛ daminɛ?,"The passage states that to start surface tension painting, you need:

*   Adhesion (nɔnili)
*   Spreading (yɛlɛli)
*   Penetration (pani)
*   BUT you also need a surfactant or solvent (antirɛneman dɔni na walima forimu) to start.

Looking at the answer choices, we need the element from the passage that is crucial for starting. Nɔnni (adhesion), yɛlɛli (spreading) and pani (penetration) are all elements, so they are not crucial by themselves.

However, the passage states ""mako be antirɛneman dɔni na walima forimu walasa ka daminɛ"", meaning a surfactant or solvent is crucial to initiate (damine) the process. None of the answers represent this. Of the answers provided, Nɔnni (adhesion), Panni (penetration) or are part of the process but it does not tell us whether they are necessary to start the process.

Therefore, from the options provided, the answer is not directly stated. However, if we need to choose one of the given options that is a part of the bolili kulufulancɛɛ jira sanfɛ process, we need to find an element of the passage. In this case, the answer is:

**A: Nɔnni se** is the best of the available options, as adhesion is mentioned directly as part of the bolili kulufulancɛɛ jira sanfɛ process, although the answer is not crucial to start the process.
"

*   **A: Boli se ɲɛtaga (Drawing skill advancement):** This is definitely beneficial. Surface pattern design heavily relies on drawing skills to create the patterns.

*   **B: Famuyali fɔlɔw sumarɛn ka nɔɔni kan (Basic understanding of pattern construction):** This is crucial. Understanding how patterns are repeated, mirrored, and tiled is fundamental.

*   **C: Bolili kulufulancɛ jira sanfɛdɔnni bugunatigɛ sɛbɛn (Surface pattern design tutorial):** A tutorial can provide step-by-step instructions, techniques, and inspiration, making it very helpful.

*   **D: Nɔnni se (Copying skill):** While copying can be helpful for learning, it's not the core skill required for **creating** surface patterns. The passage talks about designing your own patterns, so original work is the focus. Copying is more about replication than design.

All the options except D are extremely valuable for surface pattern design. However, the best answer from the given choices would be **A, B and C** but the options don't give it. The next best is **A, B, C and D.**

**Therefore, the best option is A, B, C, and D.**

The passage states: ""Tanti sigili wali yɔrɔla walima dugu dɔ kɔnɔ be seka mɔgɔ ɲɛsin i ma nɔgɔyala."" This directly translates to ""Setting up a tent or at a work location or in a town can help direct people to you easily.""

The text explicitly states: ""Mobili jɔlensigili be seka kɛ nin mobili kɔnɔfɛrɛlen ba b'i bolo, SUV, Sedan walima Wagon Station nin sigiyɔrɔw minunw be kari."" This translates to ""Car camping is possible with a well-equipped vehicle, SUV, Sedan or Station Wagon, as long as the terrain allows.""  Therefore, having a suitable vehicle (like an SUV or well-equipped car) is essential for car camping.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔnni tun ye Casablanca jɔ siɲɛn filanan na?","The correct answer is **D: Maroc masakɛ**.

This translates to ""The Moroccan king rebuilt it as Daru I-badya and the name Casablanca was given to it by the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there."" This implies that the Moroccan king rebuilt the city.
"

The text states: ""Portugal mɔgɔw y'o ci ani k'o jɔ duguni nin Casa Branca tɔgɔ, ka ban alan dɔrɔ dugukoloyɛrɛyɛrɛ dɔ kɔfɛ san ba 1755"" which translates to ""The Portuguese rebuilt it and named the city Casa Branca, after a devastating earthquake in 1755."" This indicates the Portuguese rebuilt Casablanca after a disaster.

This translates to: ""The accessibility and beauty of Sintra made it easy for visitors, and *what they knew of it was due to the beautiful descriptions filmed by Lord Byron*.""

Therefore, Lord Byron's descriptions are what popularized Sintra among visitors.
"
Mun ma koɲumandɔn Armenie fɛ?,"The correct answer is **D: Jamana kura** (New country).

The passage states that no country, including Armenia itself, has recognized the new country formed after the conflict. This implies that Armenia's hesitation/refusal to recognize the ""jamana kura"" is a core issue. While the other options are related to the conflict, the central point is the non-recognition of this newly formed entity.
"
Fɛn jumɛn bɛka Azerbajan ani Armenie cɛ ciyɛn?,"The correct answer is **D: Nagorno-Karabakh maarayɔrɔ**

The passage explicitly states that the political disputes are related to the Nagorno-Karabakh region: ""Politiki `mankanw maarayɔrɔ kuna be bek'alisa Armenie ani Azerbajan ka  cɛw cɛn."" This translates to ""Political disputes related to the region's issue are causing differences between Armenia and Azerbaijan.""
"
"Ka sɔrɔ takisi dɔ bɛ ka ta Charlotte, fɛn tun bɛna dɔ fara doni ka?","The correct answer is **B: Pasase mɔgɔ saba sɔrɔli**.

The passage states: ""Sirisarizi beyi nin a tɛmɛ mɔgɔ fila kan, o la o cogoya in be seka gɛlɛya ka tɛmɛ a nafan kan."" This translates to: ""Surprises happen when it exceeds two people, so this situation may make it harder than its benefit.""

This implies that having more than two passengers (meaning at least three) is a potential disadvantage or negative consequence when taking a taxi in Charlotte. Therefore, before taking a taxi, one should consider whether having three or more passengers is worth the potential drawbacks.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun tun be se ka kɛ jate gɛlɛya ye Charlotte kɔnɔna ni denminsenw ye?","The correct answer is **B: Takisi dɔ tali**.

The passage states: ""Takisi be itilize waaticamana duw fɛ Charlotte kɔnɔ, ali na sɔrɔ u nafan be seka kɛ yi siratigɛ dɔw fɛ. Sirisarizi beyi nin a tɛmɛ mɔgɔ fila kan, o la o cogoya in be seka gɛlɛya ka tɛmɛ a nafan kan.""  This translates to: ""Taxis are often used by families in Charlotte, but their benefit can be limited in some ways.  Taxis are expensive, especially with more than two people, so this can make it more difficult than beneficial.""

Therefore, the difficulty specifically mentioned in the passage regarding children in Charlotte is taking taxis due to the expense.

This indicates that before the Spanish arrived, the northern part of Chile was under the Inca rule, while the Araucanians (Mapuche) lived in central and southern Chile.  The question asks about the *southern* part of Chile.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Araucanians**. Although Mapuche and Araucanians are the same, Araucanians is used in the sentence that answers the question.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn tun ma ma kɛ san 1810?","The correct answer is **B: Chilie tun ye sebaya sɔrɔ Ɛpaɲɔli ka**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Chile declared its independence in 1810, but Spain did not formally recognize Chile's independence until 1818. This means Chile hadn't *gained* its sovereignty from Spain in 1810.
*   The passage states that Chilie declare its independence in 1810 (D).
*   The passage states that Napoleon was at war (C).
*   The passage states that the Spanish government was in power for two years (A)."
Mɔgɔw bɛ se ka dugu lasamanenw lasɔrɔ cogodi Liguria mara la?,"Based on the text, Cinque Terre villages are connected by paths, trains and boats. Cars have very limited access. Therefore the correct answer is:

**C: Tirɛn walima batɔn la (Train or boat)**
"
Italikan na ‘Cinque Terre’ kuma kɔrɔ ye mun ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Dugu duuru**.

The passage states: ""min kɔrɔ ye Dugu Duuruw..."" which translates to ""...which means Five Villages."" Since Cinque Terre is being defined as meaning ""Dugu Duuruw"" in the given context, and we know ""Cinque Terre"" is the Italian phrase in question, then ""Dugu Duuruw"" represents the meaning of ""Cinque Terre"" in Italian. Therefore, Dugu Duuru translates to ""Five Villages"". The passage clearly states ""Dugu Duuruw, minunw ye jidala wulakɔnɔna fitini duuruw ye..."", which translates to ""Five Villages, which are five small coastal villages..."".

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, samara suguya jumɛn de kaɲi tɛrɛntɛnni waati cogoyaw la?","Let's analyze the passage to determine which type of sand is best suited for icy conditions.

Later it states: ""Kiranpɔn be samaraba dɔw la ani kiranpɔn farakan dɔ beyi tɛrɛntɛn waatiw la, min ben samaraw ani samarabaw camaw ma, o talɔnw walima talɔnw ani samarajuw. Talɔnw kan ka surunya ani boɲa."" This mentions that granite in sand is good for icy conditions, and specifies to use short, large-sized sand.

Looking at the options:

*   **A: Samara talɔn surunmaw (Short sand grains):** This aligns with the passage mentioning that the gravel/grit should be short.
*   **B: Kiranpɔn farakan samaraw (Granite particle sand):** While granite is mentioned, the option does not specifies whether the sizes are short or long.
*   **C: Samara talɔn jamanjanw (Long sand grains):** This contradicts the passage.
*   **D: Samara minnu milimɛtiri (1/5 puse) tanw (Sand grains that are 5 mm or 1/5 of an inch):** The passage mentions sand of this size, but it does not mention that this is the best sand for icy conditions.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: Samara talɔn surunmaw**."
Ninnu jumɛn kelen tɛ dɛmɛdo walasa ka samali taɲɛ sira gilasi manw kan nɛnɛ waati la?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Ji (Water)**.

The passage states: ""Cɛncɛn, bɛlɛ walima kɔkɔ (kiloridi de kalisiyɔmu)be yɛrɛkɛ waatidɔw la gudɔrɔn walima siraw kan walasa ka samali taɲɛ."" This translates to: ""Sand, salt, or gravel (calcium chloride) are spread at times on the sidewalks or roads to prevent slipping."" Therefore, sand, salt, and gravel are used to prevent slipping, indicating they help melt ice.

Water, on the other hand, would freeze and make the situation worse.

Ninnu jumɛn kelen bɛ talikɛ tigi tigi Hawaii ni Cook Gun ni ɲɔgɔn cɛ?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: U fila bɛɛ bɛ waatibɔnda kelen na**.

The text states ""Nin waatibɔnda kelen nin Hawai ye, gun ninunw be miri inafɔ """"Hawai tukuma yɔrɔ""""."" This translates to ""They are in the same time zone as Hawaii, these islands are considered the 'Hawaii of the past'."" This clearly indicates that Cook Islands and Hawaii share the same time zone.

Let's analyze why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dunanjigisow baw b'u fila bɛɛ bolo (They both have large populations of tourists):** The passage implies Cook Islands are less touristy than modern Hawaii.
*   **B: Jamanaya jɔyɔrɔ t’u fila si bolo (Neither has a national position):** The passage says Cook Islands are independent from New Zealand.
*   **D: Duguba t’u fila si kɔnɔ (Neither is in a big city):** The passage does not mention big cities."
Ninnu jumɛn kelen tɛ Cook Gun ɲɛfɔ tigi tigi?,"Let's analyze the provided information (P) and each option to determine the correct answer.

*   **P states:**
    *   Cook Islands is an independent island nation associated with New Zealand.
    *   It's located in Polynesia, in the South Pacific Ocean.
    *   It consists of 15 islands with a total land area of 240 square kilometers.
    *   It shares the same time zone as Hawaii and is sometimes referred to as ""Hawaii before Hawaii.""
    *   It's not a single island but a collection of 15 islands.
    *   The largest islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.

Now let's examine the options:

*   **A: A ka dɔgɔ katɛmɛ Hawaii (It is smaller than Hawaii)** - P gives the land area as 240 square kilometers. Hawaii is significantly larger than this. This is true.

*   **B: Gun kuluw dɔ do (It is a group of islands)** - P explicitly states ""gun kuluw ye min ye gun 15 ye"" (It is a group of islands that is 15 islands). This is true.

*   **C: A dugubaw ye Rarotonga ani Aitutaki (Its biggest islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki)** - P states ""Gun belebelebaw ye Rarotonga ani Aitutaki ye"" (The biggest islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki). This is true.

*   **D: Gun jamana in ni Hawaii jɛlen do waatibɔnda kelen na (This island nation and Hawaii are connected in the same time zone)** - P states ""Nin waatibɔnda kelen nin Hawai ye"" (It shares the same time zone as Hawaii). This is true.

The question asks which option is **NOT** a correct description of Cook Islands. All of the provided descriptions are accurate based on the text. Therefore, I must assume that the question is phrased incorrectly or there is a mistake in the text or answer options.

However, if I **must** choose one answer, I would choose **A: A ka dɔgɔ katɛmɛ Hawaii (It is smaller than Hawaii)** because although true, this option doesn't emphasize the multi-island nature or location as much as other features like time zone or island names. This is a very weak justification.

Here's why:

*   The document states: ""CafeNet El Sol be sɛbɛni minɛnikaliba baara kɛ dolari 30 la, walima dolali 10 nin tile kelen sɛbɛn ye"" which translates to ""CafeNet El Sol manages permit applications for $30, or $10 per day permit.""
*   The document also states: ""Pariki dɔn sɛbɛn be seka minɛkabila jɔna jɔna Ranger Station la Puerto Jimenez kɔnɔ, nka u tɛ sɔn juru karitiw la"" which translates to ""Park permits can also be obtained at the Ranger Station in Puerto Jimenez, but they do not accept credit cards.""

Therefore, CafeNet El Sol is the only location listed that is confirmed to process permit applications. While the Ranger Station in Puerto Jimenez processes permits, it does not accept credit cards, and the question specifies avoiding credit card payment.

The passage states: ""Nin baara in be wele fɛnɛ ko wulakɔnɔ siki, yɔrɔmunu mununi siki walima **tama tama siki**... laban ninunw be kɛ sira garo nin kan..."". This clearly indicates that ""tama tama siki"" is performed on the tire grooves.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Cogoya ɲumanw na, i bena seka yɔrɔ camaw boli cogoyala min tɛ tama ye..."" which translates to ""With good techniques, you will be able to travel many places quickly without stopping."" This directly implies that good techniques help increase speed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Samaraw jalen (Prepared tools):** While tools are mentioned, the passage says the final steps involve them, not necessarily that they directly contribute to increased speed.

*   **B: Kɔlasaki girinma dɔ (Less classic climbing):** The passage mentions the difficulty of navigating tricky terrain, not directly a method for increasing speed but more the opposite - a difficulty to overcome.

*   **D: Sira dilaniw (Road planning):** The passage notes that on difficult terrain, the rider will have to do a lot of work to find the route to progress; suggesting that road planning may not be the direct answer.
"
Taamaden minnuw bɛ seginyɔrɔnkan jatigɛ sɔrɔ u bɛ ka gɛlɛya sɔrɔ mun kɛli la?,"The English translation of the original text is:

P: Return shock happens because the culture left behind has changed (usually for the worse), and the person has also changed from that culture. People who easily adapted to the new culture have a harder time integrating back into their own culture. When you return home from abroad, you've become accustomed to the new culture and will miss some aspects of it. When you went abroad, people expected you to adapt to the new culture. People often forget that this expectation and understanding is important for people returning home.

Now let's analyze the questions and answers in the second language. It seems to be a Malian language, possibly Bambara.

Q: Taamaden minnuw bɛ seginyɔrɔnkan jatigɛ sɔrɔ u bɛ ka gɛlɛya sɔrɔ mun kɛli la? (Travelers who experience reverse culture shock, why do they have difficulties?)

A: K’i bɛn yɔrɔ kura danbe ma (Adapting to the culture of the new place)
B: Ka kɛ sabalibaa nin faamubaa ye (Being patient and understanding)
C: Ka taama ka taa kɔkan (To continue travelling)
D: K’i rɔbɛn faso danbe ma (Adapting to the culture of the homeland)

Based on the translation of text P, the most relevant answer is related to adapting to the homeland. Returning travelers find it difficult because they have to readapt to their original culture, which has also changed since they left.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: K’i rɔbɛn faso danbe ma (Adapting to the culture of the homeland)**
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira ye, seginyɔrɔnkan jatigɛ bɛ sɛn ka kɛ kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnenya la gɛlɛya ye taamaden suguya jɔn ma?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Taamaden minnu ye gɛlɛya kɛrɛnkɛrɛnw sɔrɔ danbe yɛlɛma kɔnɔ (Travelers who experience particular hardship when adapting to a new culture).**

Here's why:

The passage describes ""reverse culture shock"" and how returning home can be difficult because expectations and understanding are often lacking.  The key point is that people struggle to readapt to their original culture after experiencing a new one. This struggle represents hardship in cultural adaptation.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Taamadenw minnu y’u bɛrɛbɛn teliya la k’u to kɔkansigi la (Travelers who adapt quickly to life abroad):** The passage focuses on the *difficulty* of readaptation, not ease.

*   **C: Taamaden minnuw bɛ nisɔndiya kɔnɔ halibi inafɔ k’u bɛ kɔɲɔso la (Travelers who are always happy, as if they were at a festival):** While happiness is positive, the text is about the challenges of cultural (re)integration.

*   **D: Taamadenw minnu ka sabali ka dɔgɔn (Travelers who have little patience):** While impatience might worsen the situation, the core issue is the struggle to readapt after cultural immersion. The original text's main problem revolves around the difficulties in integrating back to the original culture after experiencing a new one.
"
Ninnu jumɛn tun kɛli ka kan ka toye mɔgɔw fɛ nin minɛn ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka kɛ i n'a fɔ u tɛ yen** (To act as if it doesn't exist).

Here's why:

* **P's statement clearly warns against approaching or interacting with the dangerous item (minɛn).** It emphasizes the risk of harm.
* **Option A** aligns directly with this warning. Avoiding the item entirely is the safest course of action.
* **Option B** (Approaching knowingly) contradicts the warning.
* **Option C** (Reducing their fear) while potentially helpful in general, doesn't negate the danger of the item itself. Even without fear, approaching it is risky.
* **Option D** (Judging it from afar) might seem reasonable, but the initial warning implies that even observation from a distance could lead to temptation and ultimately, danger. The safest approach is avoidance.

Therefore, **A** is the only answer that directly reflects the cautionary message of statement P.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Nin mɔgɔw ma minɛn ye inafɔ lala farati fɛn, u bena gɛrɛ a la ka damatɛmɛ kosbɛ ani k'u yɛrɛw bila faratila."" This translates to: ""Those who do not perceive the tool/mine as a dangerous thing will approach it carelessly and expose themselves to danger."" This means some people don't realize the seriousness of the danger.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: U ye daaba jamannenw ye u dan cogo la (They are commonly used where they are manufactured):**  The passage focuses on the *perception* of the mine, not its manufacturing or common usage location.
* **C: U bɛ sɛn ka muruti nin jama gɛrɛlen ye kojugu (They increase when people get close):** The passage speaks to the mindset of people approaching the mine not how the mines get created.
* **D: U bina u yɛrɛ lakana n’a ya kun bɔ (They will protect themselves if they come to light):** The passage discusses about the lack of care when people approach mines.
Therefore, **B** is the option that best aligns with the information presented in passage P.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira ye, ninnu na jumɛn farati ka dɔgɔn n’a bɛɛ ye dezɛri woyasikɛla ma?","Based on the passage, here's the breakdown of why the answer is likely A:

*   **P states that:**
    *   Hallucinations can cause a traveler to think that water is near (or another thing that they might need). This may be dangerous if the traveler continues to hallucinate while trying to find water or other things. Also, it becomes an ordeal with possible heat strokes and dehydration.
    *   Desert heat during the day and the cold at night.
    *   Body temperature drop is dangerous if clothing isn’t adequate.

*   **Q asks:** According to the passage, which of the following are less dangerous for a desert traveler?
*   **A: Funtenima fini tanɲa sufɛ nɛnɛ bɔ don (cold nights if clothes aren't enough)**: The passage explicitly mentions that body temperature drop is dangerous, so if the traveler has clothes that are adequate, the danger becomes less.
*   **B: Ka hakili wasu wasu ye min bena jira ko ji beyi (hallucinations that water is near):** The passage clearly states hallucinations can be dangerous.
*   **C: K’i yɛrɛ sɛgɛn fu hakili wasu wasu ɲininni la (trying to look for water while hallucinating):** The passage clearly states hallucinations can be dangerous.
*   **D: Ka ji tiɲɛn fu hakili wasu wasu ɲininni la (dehydration while hallucinating):** The passage clearly states hallucinations can be dangerous.

So, based on the information in the passage, the only one with a lessened threat is **A**.

**Therefore, the correct answer is A.**"
Ninnu jumɛn ma kofɔ inafɔ farati sɛbɛ don dezɛri woyasikɛlaw ma?,"Based on the provided passage, the correct answer is **C: Farikolo tanperatiri jiginle (Farikolo tanperatiri jiginle ye farati ba ye nin fani kalama teyi.)**

Here's why:

*   The passage directly states: ""**Farikolo tanperatiri jiginle ye farati ba ye nin fani kalama teyi.**"" which translates to ""Body temperature drops are a big danger when clothing is wet.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Jiko gɛlɛya**: While dehydration is related to desert travel and mentioned (ji beyi), the passage emphasizes the danger of *continuous confusion* and the risks associated with it.
*   **B: Hakili wasu wasu**: The passage talks about mental confusion (hakili wasu wasu), but it focuses on the *consequences* of the confusion, and *farikolo tanperatiri jiginle* are more directly described as the big danger.
*   **D: Tilelajeni**: While sunstroke (or heatstroke) is a risk in the desert, it's not explicitly mentioned as the primary danger in the context of the provided text."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni sɛbɛn nin ye, jamakulu jumɛn mɔgɔw tun ye gɛlɛya caman sɔrɔ ka tɛmɛ jama wɛrɛw kan tubabu sɛgɛsɛgɛlikɛlaw nali kɔ?","The correct answer is **C: Taínos**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Dominican Republic was originally home to indigenous peoples, specifically the Ataino.
*   The passage also mentions that the Ataino population was significantly reduced due to Spanish colonizers.

Therefore, the Taínos experienced the most hardship as a result of the arrival of European explorers."
"Ka kɛɲɛn ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Kan jumɛn tun bɛ fɔ Caribes fɛ?","The passage states: ""Akaribe marĩ adũ maaragia mwario wa Arawakan arĩa makinyĩte kũu ĩhida rĩa 10,000 BCE"".  This translates to ""The Caribs were people who spoke the Arawakan language who arrived there around 10,000 BCE"".

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.
"

The text states: ""san 1861 kɔnɔ siki tulɔnkɛyɔrɔ fɔlɔ da yɛlɛla Norvege jamanaden dɔw fɛ Ɔsitirali kɔnɔ."" This indicates that Norwegian people were involved in opening the first ski club.

"Ka kɛɲɛn ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ka gɛrɛ waati jumɛn na siki lakodɔnna fɔlɔfɔlɔ inafɔ farikolo ɲɛnajɛ?","The correct answer is **D: Sankɛmɛ 17nan**.

The passage states: ""Kuluduguma siki inafɔ o farikoloɲɛnɛjɛ be sekɔ ka ta fo siyɛkili 17 na..."" which translates to ""Cross-country skiing as a sport can be traced back to the 17th century...""
"
Ninnu jumɛn cogoya tugulen bɛ gun bɛɛ la belebele la Farafinna gun kɔrɔnfɛla fɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Kunkokɔnɔ siratigɛ fɛ**.

The passage states: ""Magasikari ye ula belebele ba ye, ani a dama tɔgɔla kɔntinan ye nin na kɛra kunkokɔnɔ siratigɛ fɛ."" This directly implies that Madagascar and its surrounding islands have been shaped by continental drift. The other options aren't presented as a formative force that explains the existence of the archipelago, but rather as cultural or economic influences.
"
Mun tɛ farafinna gun kɔrɔnfɛla gun dɔgɔmanw taamasiyɛn ye? ,"Based on the text provided, here's the breakdown and the answer:

The text mentions:

*   ""Gun fitiniw camaw ye yɛrɛmahɔrɔn jamanaw ye, walima tugulen Faransi la..."" - *Many small islands are independent nations, or attached to France.*
*   ""...kodɔnlen no inafɔ kɔkɔjida ɲɛmanbaw yɔrɔw"" - *Known as popular tourist destinations.*

Therefore, the correct answers are:

*   **A: Jɛɲɔgɔnya dɔ faransi fɛ** (Association with France)
*   **B: Nafolotigi lafiyɛnbɔyɔrɔ caman** (Many popular tourist destinations)
*   **D: Yɛrɛmahɔrɔnya sɔrɔ ka bɔ jamana wɛrɛw bolo** (Independence from other countries)

Option C is not mentioned in the text."
"Ka kɛɲɛn ni tɛmɛsira in ye, pakiseli bɛ kɛ cogo di kerecɛn laadala kɛrɛnkɛrɛnlen tigi alabatoso dɔw bolo?","The correct answer is **B: Ka sibirisu ɲɛnamali jatigiya**.

The passage states that many traditional churches celebrate Easter Vigil on Saturday night during Holy Week. Easter Vigil is a service held on Holy Saturday (the night before Easter) and is the celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.
"
"Ka sɛn k’i fɔrin sariya dɔw kɔrɔ i dontɔla Ecuador, mun fɔlɔ ka Kan ka kɛ Cuba sigiden bolo?","Based on the information in passage P, the correct answer is **B: Sariya siratigɛla weleli bataki (A legal invitation letter)**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""Equateur b'a jagoya Cuba dugudenw ka weleli sɛbɛn sɔrɔ..."" which translates to ""Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to have an invitation letter..."" This is the most direct and important requirement mentioned at the start of the passage.

Let's look at the other options to see why they are NOT the best fit:

*   **A: Jamana kɔnɔdon sɛbɛn ɲuman kalo 6 kɔnɔ taama donw kɔfɛ (A valid passport with 6 months validity after travel):** While a valid passport is required, it is mentioned later and is not the *first* thing mentioned as a requirement.

*   **C: Taanikasegin taama sɛbɛn mun bɛ taama janya jira (Return ticket showing the length of stay):** A return ticket is required, but again, the invitation letter is mentioned first.

*   **D: Amerikɛn jamana don binkɛnɛ sɛbɛn (American Green Card):** This is only applicable to Cuban citizens who are also Green Card holders, not all Cuban citizens. It is also related to waiving a certain requirement, not a primary requirement for entry.

Therefore, the **legal invitation letter (sariya siratigɛla weleli bataki)** is the primary requirement stated in the passage for Cuban citizens visiting Ecuador.
"
Ecuador taama sariyaw ma labɛn mun kama?,"Based on the provided text, none of the answer options are explicitly stated as the *reason* for Ecuador's travel regulations. However, we can infer the most likely reason:

*   **The text focuses on controlling and documenting the entry of Cuban citizens.** The regulations require a letter of invitation, legalization by the Foreign Ministry, and specific documentation. This points to a concern about *managing* the flow of Cuban citizens into the country.

Considering this, the closest and most accurate option is:

*   **D: K’i hakililatigɛ jamana donni sɛbɛnw numanya kan (To have control over the documentation of people entering the country)**

Therefore, the answer is **D**.
"
Ninnu na jumɛn sɔngɔ bɛ caya walijamanakɔnɔ ka tɛmɛ faso Kan?,"The passage focuses on the easier and potentially cheaper production of eyeglasses (lunɛtiw) in certain countries, particularly those with lower labor costs.  It mentions that these countries might offer *better* eyeglasses, overcoming any potential difficulty in importing them. The main points are about eyeglasses and insurance.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Ɲɛ furakɛli asuransi (Eye care insurance)**.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Ɲɛkili sɛgɛsɛgɛli (Eye exam):** While related, the passage's primary focus isn't on the cost of eye exams but on the cost and quality of the *glasses themselves*.
*   **B: Nunɛti kala dakabanaw (Eyeglass frame brands):** While brands might play a role, the core argument centers on general production cost advantages.
*   **D: Nunɛti kala kura (New eyeglass frames):** This is too specific. The discussion is about the overall economics of *producing and importing* eyeglasses. Eye Insurance could provide for eyeglasses made outside the country."
Mun bɛ sɛn ka na nin nunɛti kala dakabana sannin ye yɛrɛyɛrɛ walijamana kɔnɔ?,"Based on the prompt (P) which discusses the potential benefits and drawbacks of importing eyeglasses into a country, especially those with lower labor costs, and considering insurance coverage and overall quality, the best answer is:

**D: A bɛ sɛn ka kɛ asuransi tɛna jɔ musaka kɔrɔ** (It is possible that insurance will not cover the cost)

Here's why:

*   The prompt mentions insurance coverage as a factor to consider. If the imported eyeglasses are significantly cheaper, insurance companies might not fully cover their cost, leading to out-of-pocket expenses for the consumer.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ɲɛkili sɛgɛsɛgɛli wɛrɛ bɛ sɔn ka wajibiya** (Another eye exam is required): While a new eye exam might be recommended, it's not directly related to the *importation* of eyeglasses.

*   **B: Furasansɛbɛn tɛna sɔn ka bɛn nunɛti kala dɔw ma** (Prescriptions may not be valid for some eyeglasses): Prescription validity is a general issue and is not specifically tied to imported eyeglasses.

*   **C: U bɛ sɔn ka kɛ ladegen ye** (They can be imitations): While a valid concern about the quality of imported items, it's not the most directly insurance-related outcome.

Therefore, **D** is the most appropriate answer, as it highlights a potential cost implication related to importing eyeglasses, aligning with the context of the prompt."
"ka tali kɛ nin wari labaara ye Falklands, mankutu jumɛn tɛ tiɲɛ ye?","The correct answer is **A: Warita karati nin angilɛ liwuru dɔrɔn bɛ minɛ kɔfɛ gunw kan**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that credit cards might not be accepted in the outer islands, but British Pounds and US dollars *may* be accepted. This contradicts option A which indicates only credit cards and british pounds are accepted.

Here's why the other options are correct statements based on the passage:

*   **B: Stanley yɔrɔ dɔrɔn dɛ bɛna lamerikɛn dolari minɛ**- The passage states that US dollars are ""occasionally"" accepted in Stanley.
*   **C: Falkland pounds ka kan ka falen i kɛlen kɔ ka gun bila** - It states that it can be ""difficult"" to exchange Falkland pounds outside of the islands, implying they should be exchanged before leaving.
*   **D: Falkland pound bɔlen a la, British pound y wari ye sɔn kɛlen do min na kosɛbɛ** - The passage says British pounds are ""widely accepted"" throughout the islands."
"ka da tɛmɛ sira kan, i taama tɔ ka bɔ Ameriki ka taa Falklands, yɔrɔ jumɛn na warisara cogo wɛrɛ bɛ sɔn ka ɲɛ kosɔbɛ min tɛ warita karati ye?","The correct answer is **D: Stanley bɛ kɔnɔ**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Waari be seka falen banki kelen dɔrɔn de la gunw kɔnɔ min be Stanley kɔnɔ ka tɛmɛ kabɔ FIC West butiki kɔnɔ."" (Currency can only be exchanged at the one bank on the islands, located in Stanley, or through the FIC West store).

This clearly indicates that Stanley is the place to exchange currency outside of using credit cards.
"
Lajɛrɛ jumɛn tɛ danbe ka taa alabatoso ɲɛnajɛw ma?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **A: Samadenni ka wololi**.

The passage says temple festivals celebrate anniversaries, birthdays of deities, or other events associated with the temple.  ""Samadenni ka wololi"" (birth of a prophet/saint) doesn't directly fit into this category of temple-specific celebrations as described in the passage. The other options (temple renovation, deity's birthday, festivals within the temple) are mentioned in the passage.
"
Sama masirilenw bɛ ye yɔrɔ jumɛn?,"The correct answer is **B: Tanpuluw kɔno**.

The passage states: ""Keraa tanpulu fɛtiw lajɛli nafan ka bɔn, nin sama masirili..."" meaning that festivals in temples involve *sama masirili* (crowd gathering). So the crowd is most likely to gather **inside temples**.

Here's why:

*   The passage focuses on the high cost of first and business class tickets and mentions that airlines know people are willing to pay those high prices.
*   The question asks for the best way to lower the cost of those tickets.
*   Negotiation is the most direct way to potentially get a lower price than what's initially offered. While the passage implies it's difficult, it's not explicitly ruled out. The other options are clearly less relevant and effective."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de ɲinini ye yɛrɛlasumaya ye ni bɛ pankun tike dɔw mara?","Based on the provided passage, the correct answer is **B: Business class** and **D: First class.**

The passage explicitly discusses the high cost of both business class and first class tickets.
"
Mun de man kan ka jate ni tike wari faralen ɲɔgɔnkan ka taa farafinna n’o bɛ suma ni diɲɛ tuuru kɛli tike wari ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Farafinna wiza wari**

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions the following costs need to be included when calculating the total cost of travel to Africa and comparing it to round-the-world tickets:

*   Visa fees
*   Other expenses, such as taxes
*   Transportation time,
*   Other things and places in Africa.
*   Departure fees

Therefore, **C: Farafinna wiza wari** is what needs to be counted when estimating ticket price.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, sipɛri-marisew ye bɛ k’a daminɛ ka fɛn juman yɔrɔ caman bila senka?","The correct answer is **A: Dumuni dilannenw kaban**

The passage states: ""Taɲɛkumana, sipɛrimarisew be seka dumuni dilaninw ka ban yɔrɔ camaw bila sekan."" This directly translates to ""For example, supermarkets are able to put many places of prepared food ban on the market.""

Therefore, the supermarkets are starting to put many places of ""dumuni dilannenw ka ban"" (prepared food ban) on the market.
"
Sipɛri-marise bɛ minɛw nafama juman di n’o bɛ se ka ja dilannen sanbaga dɔ ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Dumuni minnu dilan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Taɲɛkumana, sipɛrimarisew be seka dumuni dilaninw ka ban yɔrɔ camaw bila sekan."" (For example, supermarkets can put away many places that prepare food.)
* This means supermarkets are advantageous because they reduce the need for places that make food.

Therefore, the answer choice that best reflects this advantage is **C: Dumuni minnu dilan** (Food that is prepared).

This means they **can** understand standard French numbering.

The passage also says: ""daɲɛ dɔw fɔli tɛ kelen ye dɔni"" implying differences in vocabulary. And ""jate cogoya Belgique faransɛ la ani Suisse ta danfara bɔleno Faransi t'a la dɔni, ani daɲɛ dɔw fɔli tɛ kelen ye dɔni.""  implying differences in pronunciation and vocabulary

Therefore, the only thing they CAN easily understand is standard French numbering.  The question asks what they CANNOT easily understand. The best answer is:

*   **C: Faransɛ daɲɛw fɔcogo (French pronunciation)** because while they *can* learn and understand standard French, their native pronunciation differs. This also encompasses the vocab differences and the different ways of counting, which is also affected by pronunciation.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: They can understand standard French numbering.
*   B: The passage says there are vocabulary differences, meaning they can't always understand each other's vocabulary.
*   D: They can understand the majority of French spoken in France, but there will be nuances they miss.
"
Danfara bɛ nin fɛn juman kelen ni ɲɔgɔn cɛ n’a bɛ faransi ani n’a bɛ Belquigue walima Suisse?,"The correct answer is **B: Jate cogoya**.

The passage explicitly states that the pronunciation of some words and the ""counting system"" (jate cogoya) differ between French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland compared to France. While there might be slight differences in vocabulary (daɲɛ dɔw fɔli tɛ kelen ye dɔni), the passage highlights the counting system as a key difference.  It also states that standard French, which includes standard pronunciation and grammar, is taught in schools, meaning A and D are incorrect, and C is not a difference, but a standard.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: *""Cogoya bɛɛ la, i kan ka tike maralikɛ dirɛkiteman nin pankuruso ye u ka nɛgɛjuru sifa fɛ.""* This translates to ""In all cases, you must show your ticket merchant and airline their respective rules.""
*   The question asks: ""Under what circumstances is a change fee *not* applied?""
* The text indicates that showing you ticket merchant and airline their respective rules means a change fee is not applied."
Mun ye tiɲɛ ye sudɔni wari kunkan?,"The correct answer is **D: U ka kan tike lamara dɛrɛkitiman pankurunso ka nɛgɛjurusira fɛ** (They should refer to the ticket director for the airline company depending on the baggage allowance).

The passage clearly states:  ""...i kan ka tike maralikɛ dirɛkiteman nin pankuruso ye u ka nɛgɛjuru sifa fɛ."" which translates to ""you should refer to the ticket director for the airline company depending on their baggage allowance.""

*   Therefore, a GPS app that does not rely on internet data would be safer/more useful when you are in an area with no service."
Kun juman tɛ kun ɲuman ye min kama i ka kan ka Yɔrɔɲini apilikasiyɔn dɔ utilize mansi jɔlen a yɛrɛ ye kɔfɔɲɔgɔn?,"Based on the provided text, the best answer is **A: Mako jɔbaliya ɛntɛrinɛti keredi la**.

The passage explicitly states that one advantage of the location-finding application is that it works even if you **don't have internet access** or if access is limited. This directly addresses the lack of reliance on an internet connection.

The other options are less directly supported by the text:

*   **B: Wari marali (Saving money)**: While GPS could potentially save money on car rentals with GPS, the text doesn't explicitly focus on cost savings.
*   **C: K’i yɛrɛ kisi singan ma (Avoiding deception)**: The text does not touch on this topic.
*   **D: Mako jɔbaliya kariti kura sani na (Not needing a new card)**: This is not mentioned in the text.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""I d'ala k'i be i tike ta baarakɛla min fɛ ye Galapagos dɔnba jɔnjɔn ye nin batɔn suguya camaw dɔniya ye."" This directly translates to ""Make sure you book your ticket with an operator who is a Galapagos cruise specialist and knows the different types of tours.""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A:** This is just about the size of the tour, not about ensuring it's a legitimate and appropriate tour.
*   **B:** Price is not mentioned as an indicator of legitimacy.
*   **D:** Booking far in advance doesn't guarantee the tour is responsible or appropriate."

*   **The passage states:** ""Yɔrɔ dɔw be minfɛnw alikɔliman di yɔrɔla"" which translates to ""Some places offer alcoholic beverages to locals."" This directly supports the idea that *Dafalikɛ minfɛnw (Free drinks)* are used.

*   **The passage does not mention** anything that would directly correlate with A, B, or D.

Therefore, the most likely answer is **C: Dafalikɛ minfɛnw**."
"Ka kɛɲe ni tɛmɛsira in ye, zuwekɛla ɲanama ka kan ka i yɛrɛ kisi mun ma?","The correct answer is **A: K’a dɔlɔ min ka dan tɛmɛ (K’a dɔlɔ min ka dan tɛmɛ)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions ""gulɔminkojuguya be halikilina sɛgɛsɛgɛli wasu wasu, ani zuyekɛla baw bɛɛ be hakilidafalen nafan dɔ"". This implies that excessive alcohol consumption/indulgence (gulɔminkojuguya) affects judgment and makes people vulnerable. Therefore, a ""zuyekɛla"" (a person living well) needs to avoid excessive drinking.

The other options are not directly supported by the passage:

*   **B: Ka sɔn nɛgɛsikɛlanw na (Ka sɔn nɛgɛsikɛlanw na)** There is no information about magnets.
*   **C: Ka sokɔnɔmɔnturu ni bololamɔnturu lajɛ (Ka sokɔnɔmɔnturu ni bololamɔnturu lajɛ)**: The text talks about ""finɛtiriw ani monturu tɛyi waatcamanan"", but this is about the business environment, not something an individual must avoid.
*   **D: K’i masurunyala bɔda ɲininkali kɛ (K’i masurunyala bɔda ɲininkali kɛ)**: No support for this in the text."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, daɲɛ siyɔrɔma juman sɛbɛnnen bɛ ni siginiden kunba ye kumasen camancɛ la?","The correct answer is **B: Tɔgɔw**

The passage states: ""Tɔgɔw bɛɛ, nin Sie daɲɛ ye i fɛ, be daminɛ waatibɛla nin Siginiden kunba ye, ali nin kumasen camancɛla."" This directly translates to ""All **names**, when they are proper nouns, begin with a capital letter, including in the middle of a sentence.""

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Tɔgɔw daminɛni ni siginidenkunba ye o bɛ se ka mun gɛlɛya kosɛba?","The correct answer is **B: Ka waleyakɛlanw danfara** and **D: Ka tɔgɔmantulanw danfara**.

The passage explicitly states: ""O ye sira ɲuman ye ka **waleyakɛlanw ani tɔgɔmankuntulanw danfarabɔ ɲɔgɔna**."" This translates to: ""It's a good way to differentiate **verbs and pronouns from each other**.""

Therefore, using capitalization helps to differentiate between verbs, pronouns and nouns.

"Malaysie burusikɔnɔnaw na, wale juman kɔrɔ ye “na yan”?","The correct answer is **A: Ka tigɛdenni naaninan kuru**.

Therefore, the curling of four fingers (digɛndɛnɛ deni naanina kuruli) is the action that means ""come here"".
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, wale juman kɔrɔ be se ka kɛ “segin”?","The correct answer is **A: Tikɛwili ni tikɛkɔnɔnan sini ye ɲɛfɛ**

* The passage states: ""...Grande Bretagne woyasikɛlaw Ɛsipaɲi kɔnɔ be seka fili tikɛwili kanbɛn miny tikɛkɔnɔna silinye folibama (ka tɛmɛ tikɛ beka wili mɔgɔ mina) inafɔ seginli waleya.""
* This translates to: ""...British tourists in Spain can confuse waving, which is shaking the hand back and forth, as the opposite behavior""
* This implies ""seginli waleya"" (the opposite behavior) is the action of not using your arm when you wave, which is done by just moving your hand without the arm.
* **A: Tikɛwili ni tikɛkɔnɔnan sini ye ɲɛfɛ** is closest to the definition, because the sentence means that the action ""Waving the hand back and forth without using your arm"".

Let's eliminate the other options:

* **B: Ka tigɛdenni dɔ naaninan kuru** - is not stated anywhere in the passage.
* **C: Tikɛlili ni tikɛkɔnɔnan sini ye kɔfɛ** - It doesn't make sense grammatically and is nowhere implied in the passage.
* **D: Kunkolo kɔmili** - This translates to ""head nodding,"" and while nodding is a form of communication, it's not related to the confusion between waving and the other gesture described in the passage.

Therefore, the only answer that aligns with the meaning and context of the passage is **A**.

"Ka kɛɲɛn ni temɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛnw bi se ka dogo gilasikuru pɔnan manw fɛ?","Based on the passage, the answer is **A: Karilidaw**.

The passage states: ""U bena karilidaw nati, gilasisanflacili, min be sekana dɔgɔ nin gilasikuru pɔnan manw ye."" This translates to ""They will form shards, glass fragments, which are smaller than even small glass spheres.""  This clearly indicates shards are smaller and can therefore be contained/hidden by small glass spheres.

"Ka da ni temɛsira in ye, taamadenw ka kan jantoyɛrɛla wɛrɛw ta ka kɔn yɔrɔ jumɛn lajɛli?","The correct answer is **B: Goma kɛrɛfɛ yɔrɔw** (Areas outside of Goma).

The passage states: ""OOna Goma rĩ itũra rĩ thayũ, icera orĩothe nja wa Goma nĩrĩagĩrĩirwo gũthuthurio kũmenywo haro ĩrĩa ĩkoretwo gĩtarũ kĩa North Kivu ĩikaire atĩa."" This translates to: ""Even though Goma is a safe city, every journey outside of Goma needs to be thoroughly researched to understand the security situation in North Kivu province.""

Ninnu jumɛn te ladilikan ɲuman ye turisi ma Goma?,"The correct answer is **C: Moto takisiw ye fɛrɛ ɲuman ye ka s’i seyɔrɔ la**

Here's why:

*   The passage recommends using ""boda-boda (duthi)"" to get around Goma. ""Moto takisiw"" translates to ""motorcycle taxis,"" which is essentially what boda-bodas are. The passage in P also goes on to say how much it costs to travel around so it makes sense that the answer is C."

*   Backcountry permits are available starting on the 1st of the month, four months before the month you want to camp.
*   May backcountry permits are available one month in January.

Therefore, the answer is:

*   **A: Zanwuyekalo tile 1ɔlɔ**"
Labɛn jumɛn be sena Kaniɲɔn lakanan na?,"Based on the provided passage in Kikuyu, the correct answer is **D: Yamaruyaw hakɛ sigili** (Limiting the number of permits).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that backcountry permits are limited to protect the Grand Canyon. The permits are used to protect the canyon.
* The passage states: ""Marua cinyihagĩo kũgitĩra Canyon"". This translates to ""Permits are limited to protect the Canyon"".

The other options are incorrect because:

*   The passage does not explicitly mention that permits are needed in certain areas, nor that one must have the permits made ahead of time. The passage does explicitly mention that the number of permits are limited.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is **D**."
Ninnu jumɛn de b’inafɔ sɔrɔli ka dɔgɔ ninnu dunanjigisow nasugu minnu ɲɛfɔlendon ni tɛmɛsiran in na?,"Based on the text, here's why the best answer is C:

*   **Text Analysis:** The passage describes hotels as places where ""famaw ani mɔgɔ kodɔnlenw kun jigin yɔrɔmina,"" meaning they are places for ""kings and well-known people."" It also mentions that ""waatidɔw la sura ɲuman dɔn walima sufɛgitan kɛ"" this implies that they served as a meeting place for leaders or influential figures. Lastly it mentions that u be ta mɔgɔ kɛrɛnkɛrɛniw fɛ, u be kɛ waatidɔw la jamana ɲɛmɔgɔw walima mɔgɔba wɛrɛw jiginyɔrɔ ye.

*   **Option Evaluation:**

    *   **A: Negelafɛn minkɛyɔrɔ (Place to hide wealth):** The text doesn't directly emphasize hidden wealth, although luxury is implied.

    *   **B: Dumunimɔgɔ ka dumunikɛyɔrɔ (A popular place to eat):** The text mentions a good reputation and hospitality. It does not emphasize a place to eat.

    *   **C: Tɔɲɔgɔn dunanw minnu dɔn bɛ ka ɲɛn walima lakodɔnnen (Meeting place for prominent or well-known guests):** This aligns perfectly with the text's description of hotels being frequented by kings, famous people, and even national leaders.

    *   **D: So labɛnnenw sisannen ni labɛn minɛ kuraw ye (Sophisticated establishments with old and new equipment):** The text mentions that the hotels had older installations and newer equipment, but it does not directly emphasize the types of equipment.

**Therefore, C is the most accurate answer.**"
"ka da ni kunnafoni fɔlen ye ni tɛmɛsira in na, ninnu sɔnfɛn jumɛn bina diyanye bi se ka dɔgɔya dunanjigiso dunaw ye?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Minɛ kɔrɔw yɔrɔ fan bɛɛ.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions ""Ɛnsitalasiyɔn kɔ kɔrɔw, ekipeman labanw tanya ani kɔrɔli suguya dɔ y'u kɛcogo ye."" which translates to ""Installation of old relics, the absence of modern equipment, and a certain type of inspection are part of their style."" This indicates that historical hotels maintain their old features, which, while contributing to their character, can be an inconvenience for modern travelers who expect modern conveniences and less scrutiny.
*   The other options are not directly supported by the text.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun de ma kan ka kɛ Greenland lajɛli taamakɛlaw fɛ?","The correct answer is **D: Greenland ka weleli inafɔ “Eskimo”** (Calling Greenlanders ""Eskimo"").

The passage specifically states: ""Ota ũria hekũgwetetwo hau kabere, ona korwo kiugo """"Eskimo"""" nĩgĩtĩkĩrĩtwo bũrũrinĩ wa United States, nĩgĩkuagwo rĩnaihũthia kũrĩ andũ a Arctic arĩa matarĩ a bũrũri wa U.S, mũno mũno Canada. Ona waigua kiugo kĩu gĩkĩhũthĩrwo nĩ aikari a Greenland, ũhũthĩrĩ wa kĩo niwagĩirwo gũithemwo nĩ oki."" This translates to: ""Even though the term 'Eskimo' is accepted in the United States, it is considered offensive to Arctic people who are not from the U.S, especially in Canada. Even if you hear the term used by Greenlanders, its use should be avoided.""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn b’inafɔ gɛlɛya Greenland lajɛli taamakɛla labɛnbaliw fɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Waati (Weather)**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions the challenges related to weather, stating:

    *   ""Nɛnɛ waati de ye lala farati yɛrɛ yɛrɛ min bena mɔgɔ labɛnlen baliw sɛgɛn."" (The cold weather is a real danger that will exhaust unprepared people).
    *   ""Nin i be Greeland lajɛ nɛnɛ waatiw la (Jateminɛna i be ka kɔkɔdugu yanfan fɛ cogomina, nɛnɛ be juguya o cogo kelen na), a nafan ka bɔn kana ni fini futeni dama damaniw ye.""

    *   ""Tile janba tilema fɛ be seka sunɔkɔbaliya kaɲɛ kunbalan nati ani kɛnɛya kunbalanw."" (The sun during the summer can cause sleep problems and health problems).

The other options are not as directly emphasized as challenges for *unprepared* travelers:

*   **A: Nɔridiki sosow (Northern Lights/Aurora Borealis):** The text doesn't present the northern lights as a *difficulty*, but recommends being careful around them.
*   **B: Kojugu (Bad things/Problems):** This is too general. While problems may exist, the text identifies the weather as the specific problem
*   **D: Sigadaw (Places/Regions):** While the terrain may be challenging, the passage focuses on the *weather* as the primary difficulty for unprepared travelers."
Ninnu jumɛn bi ka labaara sisan inafɔ jamankafoyɔrɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text states: ""A be baara bibi in na inafɔ jamankafoyɔrɔ..."" which translates to ""It is used now as a town square..."" and refers directly to Jardín de la Unión.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn ma sɔrɔ Jardín de la Unión kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **A: Central Gazebo ni konsɛriw** (Central Gazebo and concerts).

The passage states: ""...tileganiw fɛ ani sufɛ konsɛriw fulama be kɛ yi kabɔ Central Gazebo fɛ"" (afternoons and evenings full of concerts are held there from the Central Gazebo).

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The ""Alley of the Kiss"" is a separate location, not within the Jardin de la Union.
*   **C:** While there are restaurants, the passage doesn't describe the garden as being specifically designed or dedicated to restaurants.
*   **D:** The passage mentions Templo de San Diego but does not state that the Jardin de la Union is associated with a convent or religious order."
"Ka da ni sɛbɛn nin ye, ninnu kumasenw jumɛn tilefɛtaama kan bɛ se ka jate jɛlenbaliya fɛ?","The correct answer is **D: Tilefɛtaama tɛ kɛnɛma wale ɲuman ye denbayaw minw bɛ nin den denyɛrɛninw ye.**

Here's why:

* **The passage actually implies the *opposite* of option D.** It says that day hikes *can* be made easier even with babies and toddlers.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the passage:

*   **A: Labɛn dɔnni laɲininnendo tilefɛtaama na sira nɔgɔmaw kan** The passage states ""Tile tama sira ɲɔgɔn ma gɛrɛfɛ mako labɛniw dɔni na"" which implies that planning for easy trails is necessary for day hikes.
*   **B: Janyaw bi yɛlɛma, nka u ka kan ka bɛɛ taama tile kelen kɔnɔ** The passage mentions that day hikes cover ""kilometre kelen walima min ka jan nin o ye yɔrɔw tamaw min be seka tama dile kelen kɔnɔ"" which means their length varies but should be completed within a single day.
*   **C: Mɔgɔ min galabu ka kɛnɛ hakɛyala a ka c’a la olu kan ni wale diyabɔ** The passage states ""mɔgɔ min galabu ka kɛnɛ hakɛyala be sek'o kɛ nisondiyala"" which means people who are fit can enjoy the activity.

Therefore, option D is the only statement that is *not* supported by the passage.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, yɔrɔ jumɛnna be labɛn dɔnnin layini tilefɛtaama na?","The correct answer is **A: Na bɛ talikɛ taamakɛla galabu bɛ labɛnna**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Tile tama sira ɲɔgɔn ma gɛrɛfɛ mako labɛniw dɔni na, ani **mɔgɔ min galabu** ka kɛnɛ hakɛyala be sek'o kɛ nisondiyala."" This translates to something like ""Hiking trails need some preparation depending on people's fitness levels."" ""Mɔgɔ min galabu"" refers to the fitness or ability level of the hikers.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   B: While easy trails are good, the passage focuses more on adjusting to the fitness level.
*   C: While the passage mentions taking children, it's not the main focus of *preparation* mentioned in that specific sentence.
*   D: The passage is talking about day hikes, not just hikes in general. While some hikes might be through the woods, that's not the essential preparation point being made."
Mun de bɛ Rogaland walima Agder kulujanw danfara ka bɔ Nɔriwɛzi ta tɔw ma?,"The correct answer is **D: A datugulendo waatidɔw la nin biriyɛri ye**

The passage states that in Rogaland and Agder, these mountain ranges are sometimes called ""hei,"" which means ""flat, treeless mountain area that is sometimes covered in snow."" This directly supports option D.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn tun tese ka kɛ Nɔriwɛzi cogoya ye?","The passage states: ""kuludigɛnw yɛlɛmali ka kɛ jidigɛnw ye ani kuludigɛnw ye Norŋege cogoya ye minunw balila sira di kulujan dɔw, bɔɲɔgɔngo dɔ ma."" This translates to something like: ""Highlands transforming into lowlands and highlands are a Norwegian characteristic that allowed for some long mountains, some individual ones.""

The passage also mentions: ""Rogaland ani Agder kɔnɔ, u be wele waaticama ko """"hei"""" min kɔrɔ ye ko filemayɔrɔ jididan min datugulen dɔn waatidɔw la nin biriyɛri ye."" This translates to something like: ""In Rogaland and Agder, they are sometimes called """"hei"""" which means filemayɔrɔ (field location) lowlands that are sometimes covered with this briar.""

Based on the passage:
*   **Highlands** and **Lowlands** are mentioned as features in Norway.
*   **Filemayɔrɔw (Field Locations)** are mentioned as something called ""hei"" in Rogaland and Agder.

Out of the given options:

*   **A: Yɔrɔ kɛnɛjɛ ba (Large open spaces)** - While ""Vidde"" is mentioned as a large open space, the question asks about characteristics, and the passage focuses more on highlands/lowlands and the ""hei"" rather than explicitly stating large open spaces are a characteristic.
*   **B: Kulujan tufinnen (Isolated mountains)** - Isolated long mountains are mentioned as a result of the highland characteristic.
*   **C: Jidigɛnw (Lowlands)** - Lowlands are mentioned as a Norwegian characteristic.
*   **D: Filemayɔrɔw (Field Locations)** - Field locations covered in briar are mentioned as ""hei"" in certain regions of Norway.

Since the passage directly states that highlands transforming into lowlands is a Norwegian characteristic, and also describes ""hei"" as field locations, options C and D are strongly supported by the text. The best answer would be both C and D, but since only one answer can be selected, we need to consider which is more directly stated as a general feature.

The transforming of highlands into lowlands seems a more general geographical process, while ""hei"" is a regional term. Therefore, selecting **C: Jidigɛnw (Lowlands)** is a strong answer, but it's also fair to argue for **D: Filemayɔrɔw (Field Locations)** as being a specific type of landscape characteristic of some regions.

Considering the question asks ""ninnu jumɛn *tun tese ka kɛ* Nɔriwɛzi cogoya ye?"" meaning ""which of these *could be* a Norwegian characteristic?"", then both C and D are good answers. Since the question can only have one answer, both C and D can be said to be Norwegian characteristics. However, lowlands are created by highlands as a feature of Norway, so **C** seems to be the slightly better answer.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{C}$
"
Waati jumɛn turisiw tun b’u mako don siki lajɛlila kulumayɔrɔw la?,"The correct answer is **A: Nɛnɛ waatila**.

The passage states: ""Nka u cɛɲanw ani samalikɛlan tɛ kelenye nɛnɛ waatila,"" which translates to ""But their characteristics and offerings are not the same in the dry/cold season."" This implies that they *are* interested in those characteristics and offerings during the dry/cold season (nɛnɛ waatila).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: *""Fitinifɔlila, i bena kunafoni bila dɛmɛdilila, nin **dɔnisarize yɔrɔ tamali**...""* This clearly indicates that visiting donation locations is a part of the information gathering process.

The other options are less directly related to the main points of passage P.
"
I ka kan ka mun kɛ batow jɔyɔrɔ kɛrɛfɛ n’i bɛ ka bato ɲinin min mako bɛ dɛmɛnna?,"Based on the provided passage P, the best answer is **A: Kumaɲinanlili jisanfɛ mɔgɔ baarakɛlaw fɛ** (Ask about work done by people).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states**: ""Kumaɲininlila mɔgɔw jisanfɛ baarakɛlaw fɛ minɛnfɛn miriyɔrɔla"" which translates to ""Ask people about the work done by factory workers."" This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ka to radari jukɔrɔ (Stay under the radar)**: The passage emphasizes seeking information and talking to many people, the opposite of staying hidden.
* **C: Gɛlɛ mɔgɔw la dɔrɔn k'u t’u ka yaciw jɔsi la (Only make it difficult for people to not take their leave)**: The passage wants people to take their vacations
* **D: I mabɔ i tɔɲɔngɔ bato ɲininnaw la (Separate yourself from other batow seekers)**: The passage doesn't imply any need to separate from other seekers.
"
Yɔrɔ jumɛn bɛ turisi sama ka ta gun ka kolonizasiyɔn tariku ma?,"Based on the passage, the best answer is **D: Victoria Harbor**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions that ""Hong Kong sanfɛla dilan sumana nin nɛgɛbari yɛlɛman dɔ ye min dilan neno nin Harbour Victoria jiw ka kɛli ye."" This suggests Victoria Harbor is a major tourist attraction.
*   The passage speaks of Hong Kong's colonial history.

The other options are less directly supported by the text as a major tourist destination that is tied to the harbor.
"
Yɔrɔ jumɛn bɛ se ka turusiw la sama min bɛ lajɛli ɲuman ba kɛ?,"The correct answer is **C: Hong Kong Gun**.

The first sentence of the passage states that Hong Kong Gun is a Hong Kong landmark and a popular tourist attraction.

"
Lahalaya jumɛn kelen bɛ soboli samara la min bɛ dɛmɛdo sobolila ka lakana ma waati min baara bɛka kɛ sendalanw na?,"The correct answer is **C: Talɔn dɔ**

The passage states: ""Fɔlɔfɔlɔ, sobolila kura be soboli **samara talɔn ma dɔn** ani dugumala fɛkɛman ani fitinini."" This translates to ""First, the new carpenter knows about the carpentry **tools** and the artificial materials and fittings."" Thus, the tool is the key element mentioned. While the other options might relate to the overall process or potential components, they are not specifically mentioned as something the carpenter knows to help prevent accidents.
"
Jaabi jumɛn de dilen don taamadenw ma Jatigiya falen-falen erezow fɛ?,"Based on the provided text, the best answer is:

**A: Siyɔrɔw ani jatigiw (Places and hosts)**

The text mentions:

*   ""Jatigiya falen falen erezo ye ɔriganizasiyɔn ye min woyazikɛlaw ani dugu mɔgɔw u be ka min lajɛ tukuɲɔkɔn na."" (A Hospitality Exchange organization is where travelers and local people meet and help each other.) This implies that the organizations connect travelers with local ""hosts"" (jatigiw) and therefore provide places (siyɔrɔw) to stay.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Cogoya nɔgɔmaniw (Easy ways)** While the last part of the text mentions Casey Fenton creating a easier way to travel to Iceland, this is just an example of something done to establish a place to stay.
*   **C: Lajɛliw tukukuɲɔkɔn na min bɛ kɛ bila sirabagaw fɛ (Meetings in a common location by passengers)** While the text mentions the purpose of the Jatigiya falen falen erezo is for travelers and local people to meet and help each other, this does not mean that the only think they are made for is for travelers to meet and help each other.
*   **D: Gɛrɛɲɔgɔnnaw ni taamaden wɛrɛw ye ka taa yɔrɔ kelen lajɛ (Companions and other travelers to go to the same place)** This answer is not in the text.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛ sira in ye, ninnu laseliw jumɛn kelen minw bɛ jatigiya falen falen erezo kan ni ciyɛn tɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Dunanjigina labilalenw ka lisi bɛ di taamadenw ma u taa yɔrɔ la**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Dunanjigina labilalenw ka lisi be d'ima ola walima sɛbɛn cogoyala ani/walima ɛntɛrɛnɛti sanfɛ..."" This directly translates to ""The list of established hosts is given in the form of a phone call or written format and/or online...""

The other options are not as directly supported by the text:

*   A: While it's implied information is given, the focus is on *lists of hosts*, not a general provision of information.
*   B: The passage mentions ""erezo dɔw be sɛgɛsɛgɛli wɛrɛ laɲinin"" meaning some hosts do further screening.
*   D: While the last sentence suggests information can come from hosts, the primary emphasis is on the *lists of established hosts being provided*."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, dunan sugu jumɛn teli man di kosɛbɛ dunanjigiso den tila len dɔ kɔnɔ?","The passage states that ""Dunajiginyɔrɔ be dumuni di fɔlɔ denmisɛniw ma - duna min be san mukan kɔnɔ"". This translates to: ""Hotels give food priority to children - guests who are under the age of 10.""

Therefore, the guest most likely to be given preferential treatment in a hotel dining hall would be a child under the age of 10. Looking at the options:

*   A: Dunan minnu bɛ san mugan daminɛ la (Guests who are under 10 years old) - This matches the passage.
*   B: Dunan dɔ min kelen bɛ taama sira la (A guest who is traveling alone) - This is not mentioned as a priority.
*   C: Dunan dɔ min bɛ taama la ni denmisɛn fitiniw ye (A guest who is traveling with small children) - While the presence of small children might influence things, the passage specifically mentions children under 10 being prioritized.
*   D: Dunan dɔ min bɛ san bisaba cɛmancɛ yɔrɔ la (A guest who is around the age of 3) - While likely included in option A, the broader ""under 10"" is more comprehensive.

Therefore, the best answer is A.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛ sira in ye, jɔnni kelen ka teli kosɛbɛ ka jigin dunanjigiso dɔ kɔnɔ?","Based on the provided text and the question, the most likely answer is **D: Denbaya fila minnu bɛka woyase n’u ka denmisɛnw ye.**

Here's why:

*   **The passage mentions prioritizing babies under 6 months for food distribution and highlights that some adults may find it difficult to access resources, especially during specific seasons.**
*   **The question asks who is most likely to be turned away from the food distribution.**
* The passage indicates babies under 6 months are *prioritized*. This implies other groups might be less prioritized. This aligns with **D's** description of families traveling with older children (who are *not* under 6 months), making them less likely to be turned away as opposed to only adult travelers or those who would not be considered vulnerable, such as ""B""."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ni laseli ninnu jumɛn kelen bɛ boomerang filili bugunnatigɛ tigitigi?","The correct answer is **D: Boomerangs damadɔ dɔrɔn de bɛ se ka segin**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Boomerang camaw min be sɔrɔ Ɔsitirali tɛ boomerang segin ta ye."" This directly translates to ""Many boomerangs found in Australia are not returning boomerangs."" This implies that only *some* boomerangs return.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A bɛ segin kana i tikɛ kɔnɔ tuma bɛ n'a fila kaɲɛ** - While the passage mentions the goal of a boomerang that returns without hitting you, it doesn't say that this happens every single time.
*   **B: A kɛli ka can yɔrɔ sigibaw de fɛ katɛmɛ turisiw kan** - The passage focuses on tourism and learning to throw, but does not explicitly state it is harder for tourists than for locals.
*   **C: Boomerangs labilanen caman tɛ Ositarali** - The passage states that many boomerangs in Australia are non-returning, implying that *there are* many boomerangs in Australia, even if they don't return. The statement in C is opposite of what the passage suggests."

The passage states: ""Bana mɔgɔ minɛta ye bana ye min be yɛlɛma nɔgɔyala gɛrɛlila banabatɔ dɔ gɛrɛfɛ."" This translates to: ""A contagious disease is a disease that is easily transmitted from one infected person to another."" Therefore, a contagious disease is a disease that infects people.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, fɛn jumɛn bɛ wele ko bana mɔgɔ minɛtaw?","The correct answer is **A: Bolociliw**.

The passage states: ""Bana mɔgɔ minɛta ye bana ye min be yɛlɛma nɔgɔyala gɛrɛlila banabatɔ dɔ gɛrɛfɛ."" This translates to: ""An infectious disease is a disease that is easily transmitted from a sick person to another.""  Therefore, infectious diseases are defined by their transmissibility.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While VPNs can improve security and privacy, the passage does not say that users are primarily concerned with these aspects when choosing a VPN.
*   **C:** The passage indicates that VPNs cover *more* than just HTTP, not *only* HTTP.
*   **D:** The passage states the opposite: VPNs provide significant amounts of data transfer and are difficult to crack.

"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu laseli jumɛnw VPNs ani ɛntɛrɛnɛti tamasiyɛn jatedenw kan min tɛ ciyɛn ye?","Based on the passage (P), the correct answer is **C: Ɛntɛrɛnɛti tamasiyɛn jatedenw sɛriwisi ɲumanka dɔgɔ ni y'a ta ka suma ni VPNs ye** (Internet service providers' service is less good compared to VPNs).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""U be waaticama ɛntɛriniti kunafoniw tɛmɛ ta hakɛw cama di ani sɛriwisi ɲuman ba, Kɔdi b'ula ani ola ka gɛlɛ ka nafikiya."" This translates to: ""They (VPNs) provide many privacy benefits on internet connections and excellent service, with codes and encryption that are difficult to crack."" The implication is that ISPs are not as good in providing privacy and service compared to VPNs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: VPNs yɛrɛ bɛ kunnafoni caman di ka tɛmɛ ɛntɛrɛnɛti tamasiyɛn jatedenw kan** (VPNs themselves provide a lot of information via internet service providers): This isn't explicitly stated and doesn't capture the core point of the passage.

*   **B: Ɛntɛrɛnɛti tamasiyɛn jatedenw tɛ se ka kunnafoni tɛmɛ siraw bɛɛ yɛlɛma** (Internet service providers cannot change all the ways information passes): The passage talks about VPNs masking information, not the *ability* of ISPs to change information pathways.

*   **D: VPNs bɛ se ka http siraw dɔrɔn de yɛlɛma** (VPNs can only change http pathways): The passage states ""U be ɛntɛrɛniti siraw bɛɛ fale, min tɛ http dɔrɔn ye"" (They hide all internet connections, not just http). This explicitly contradicts option D."

Here's why:

*   The passage describes the ability to use a phone number independent of your physical location using the internet. That's the core function of Internet telephony (VoIP - Voice over Internet Protocol).

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **B: Telefɔni nɛgɛjuruw minnu bɛ se ka diɲɛ fan bɛɛ la sɔrɔ:** This is too general. While there are global phone networks, the passage emphasizes using a number *independent* of physical location, not just having access to global networks.
*   **C: Sateliti:** Satellite internet is mentioned as a way to get internet access, which is used by Internet telephony, but the question is about how to use a phone number outside your location.
*   **D: PSTN telefɔniw:** The PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) is the traditional landline system. The passage mentions this as what Internet telephony is *replacing* or offering an alternative to. It also mentions that PSTN phones can call the number, but it is not a description of how the number outside your location works.

**Therefore, the best answer is A.**"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, fɛn jumɛn kelen de kan ka kɛ walasa ka se ka weleli dɔw sɔrɔ?","The correct answer is **A: Ka nɛgɛjuru dɔ san min be weleli kɛ diɲɛ fan bɛɛ fɛ**.

The passage states: ""Waatidɔwla, i kan ka nɛgɛjuru san a dana min be weleli kɛ diɲɛ fan bɛɛ fɛ, min ba to PSTN telefɔniw be sek'i wele."" This directly translates to ""Sometimes, you need to buy a phone number that allows calls worldwide, so that PSTN telephones can call you."" This makes option A the most accurate answer.

Here's why:

*   **P states that:** ""Sigidi yɛrɛ yɛrɛ ka jateminɛ ye c ani g ye, bari u kalanli be yɛlɛma ko sababu kɛ dafalen nata ye. D'ala fɛnɛ ki ye r ani rr kalan cogoyala minunw tɛ kelen ye"" This supports that *some* pronunciations change based on following vowels. The initial statement ""Fɔli ka nɔgɔ cogoyala Italiyɛnla bari daɲɛ bɛɛ be fɔ cogoya inafɔ cogomina u sɛbɛnleno"" implies that a large portion ARE pronounced as written, but the following statement directly contradicts D and supports C.

*   **A** is true because ""D'ala fɛnɛ ki ye r ani rr kalan cogoyala minunw tɛ kelen ye: caro kɔrɔ kanuba, tumamina carro kɔrɔ ye wotoro.""

*   **B** is implied true, as the first sentence indicates that Italian pronunciation generally follows the writing.

*   **C** is true because ""Sigidi yɛrɛ yɛrɛ ka jateminɛ ye c ani g ye, bari u kalanli be yɛlɛma ko sababu kɛ dafalen nata ye.""

Thus, the only statement that is not true in the P summary is **D: Daɲɛw fan ba fɔ cogo bɛ yɛlɛma kad'u ka dafalen nataw kan** (Most words pronunciation changes based on the following vowels)
"
Izmir kan nin tamaseerew jumɛn bɔra ka kɔn bi tile ɲɛn?,"The correct answer is **all of them**:

The paragraph mentions all the options as things that were developed or built in Izmir:

*   **A: Sirafilancɛɛ be lebelebaw (Large buildings in the European style)**
*   **B: Sojan ɲɛfɛra fitiri manw (Wide boulevards)**
*   **C: Butikiw (Boutiques)**
*   **D: Sosanfɛla bilemanw (Modern apartments)**

Therefore, all the options are things that existed in Izmir. Since the question asks which of these existed before, and the paragraph describes the development of Izmir during the 18th century and beyond, all of these things would have been built after the ancient city.

Therefore, the best approach is to say that all the listed options are correct, or to look for a way to indicate that they were all present in Izmir's history."

Hanami daɲɛ bɛ mun filɛli kofɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: Kodofin fɔlɔw**.

The passage states: ""nin kodɔnlen inafɔ hanami, kɛra Japon tabolo dɔ ye kabini siyɛkili 8 nanla.""  This clearly links ""hanami"" with the viewing of ""kodɔnfin faleni lajɛliw"" (cherry blossoms).
"
Jɔnni ye kodoninfin faleni lajɛliw labɛnw daminɛ fɔlɔ fɔlɔ?,"The correct answer is **C: Zapɔn masakɛ**.

The passage states: ""Zapon kɔnɔ, kodofin fɔlɔw falenfanw kun bilɛ masakɛ fɛ a yɛrɛ dɔrɔn ye ani dugutigilakaw minunw be masakɛ so gɛrɛfɛ."" This translates to: ""In Japan, the first codoninfin faleni (flower arrangements) were reserved for the emperor himself and for dignitaries close to the emperor."" This implies the Emperor of Japan started or heavily influenced the practice in Japan.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Jerusalɛmɛ ka ni fɛn jumɛn de man telin ka turisimu sama?","The passage explicitly mentions:

*   Religious significance (""dugu in ye dinɛ sabaw minunw Maa kelen kofɔ dinemayɔrɔ - Ziwifuya. Kiretiyɛnla ani Silamɛya...dugu in dinɛ nafan ye"")
*   Historical and cultural sites (""Tariku, fuyeli ani seko ni dɔnko yɔrɔ camaw be Jerusalem, nin a sani kɛ yɔrɔw falen ba ani makananw, kafeminw yɔrɔw ani dumunikɛyɔrɔw ye"")
*   Sites of cultural and historical significance (""tariku, fuyeli ani seko ni dɔnko yɔrɔ camaw"").

While the passage mentions Jerusalem is considered Israel's capital, it emphasizes that this is *disputed* by other nations. It doesn't state the city's status as the capital as a specifically attractive feature for tourism.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: Duguba dinɛ nafaw**, **C: A ka seko ni dɔnko ɲɛnɛjɛw**, and **D: Seko ni dɔnko yɔrɔw camanw**. All of these options are explicitly mentioned as things that attract tourism.

However, if I had to choose only one answer, the best answer would be **A: Duguba dinɛ nafaw** given that the passage makes a point to note the 3 major religions that all consider Jerusalem to be a holy site, more so than the other aspects of the city."
Nin jumɛn de ma fɔ tɛmɛsiran in kɔnɔ ka kɛ fɛn ye Jerusalem dɔnnen bɛ min ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Politiki hawujali**.

The passage discusses Jerusalem's historical significance, religious importance, and cultural attractions. While it acknowledges that other countries and the United Nations do not formally recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, it doesn't specifically mention ""politiki hawujali"" (political instability) as a defining characteristic, even if it is a relevant issue.

"Ka Kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, dugutagala sugu jɔn tɛna sani sɔrɔ ni Wild Card ye?","The correct answer is **B: Woyasikɛla min bɛ Kruger National Park dɔrɔn lajɛ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""A nafan be seka bɔn mɔgɔ dɔ ma lala ka Kunko Kariti san, min dɔn niw danga Sud-Afiriki pariki sugandilenw kɔnɔ walima Su-Afiriki Dugu Parikiw bɛɛ."" This means the Wild Card provides access to *selected* South African parks or *all* South African National Parks.
*   Option B is the only one that limits the traveler to *only* Kruger National Park, meaning they would not benefit from the Wild Card's broader coverage. The other options all involve visiting more than just Kruger."
Nin kumasen jumɛn nin tɛ Kruger Park National ɲɛfɔ ka ɲa?,"The correct answer is **C: Ale de ye Sudafiriki Parks National bɛɛ la dɔgɔmani ye**.

Here's why:

* **The text states Kruger is one of the largest** not the smallest (dɔgɔmani) of South Africa's national parks. The other options are supported by the text.
"
Nin jumɛn bɔlenba b’a fɛ ka kojugu lase kuluyɛlɛnnaw ma ka sababu kɛ ni kulu kɛrɛw dakɛɲɛni ye?,"The answer is **C: Kulu donda fitiniw**

Here's why:

* The passage specifically mentions ""Kulu dɔnda fitinini dɔ be kulu sanfɛlara min tɛmɛ kan ka kɛ min fɛ, a ka surun kosɛbɛ ani a ka dɔkɔ."" This translates to ""A small doorway is on the top of the mountain which is passed through, it is very narrow and small."" This directly indicates that the small doorways pose a challenge to climbers.
"
Nin kuma jumɛn tɛ kɛɲɛni Machu Picchu kulu yɛlɛnda ɲɛfɔlen ye nin tɛmɛsiran in kɔnɔ kaɲɛ?,"Let's analyze each option based on the provided text:

*   **A: Hali kuluyɛlɛna kɛnɛmanw ninakili bɛna se ka durun** (Even experienced climbers can get tired). The passage states that ""even fit people should budget about 45 minutes for the climb."" This implies that the climb is challenging and can tire people out, even the fit ones. So, this statement aligns with the text.

*   **B: Juru min bɛ minɛ tikɛ la o fosi tɛ dingɛmayɔrɔw la** (The rope that is holding the tile is not broken in the dangerous places). The passage says that ""On steeper sections metal cables are used to provide handholds."" This indicates that ropes are present in digɛn mayɔrɔw (steeper sections) for support. So, this is not kɛɲɛni (true) and is in the text.

*   **C: I ka kɛn ka tɛmɛn kulu donda fitini dɔ fɛ sanfɛlala** (You have to pass through a small mountain pass on the way to the top). The passage states, ""The final climb to the summit involves passing through a very narrow and small tunnel."" This confirms the existence of a small passage to the summit. Thus, this statement is true and is not the correct answer.

*   **D: dingɛmayɔrɔw bɛ kɛ farati waati min n'u ɲiginnen don** (The dangerous places are dangerous when they are touched). The text says, ""be careful on steeper sections, especially near edges, as they can be dangerous quickly."" It implies that the steeper sections, particularly near the edges, can become dangerous very quickly. It's not necessarily about simply touching them, but about the proximity to edges in these areas. Thus, this statement is also true and is not the correct answer.

The question asks which statement is *not* kɛɲɛni (true) according to the passage. Option B is the answer because it says that there are no ropes/cables in the digɛn mayɔrɔw, which contradicts the passage that says cables are used on the steeper sections.

**Therefore, the correct answer is B.**"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsiran in ye, ninnu jumɛn de tɛ Majorikaw ka duminitɔbita fanba dɔ ye?","Based on the passage, the Majorcan diet prominently features:

*   Buuru (Buru)
*   Nakɔkɔnɔ fenw (Nakɔkɔfɛnw)
*   Sogo (Sogo), especially lamb
*   Olive tulu (Olive oil)

The passage does not mention ""kisɛ"" (nuts/seeds) as a staple.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Kisɛ**
"
"Ka da kunafoniw kan minnu bɛ tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ, kuma jumɛn fɔlen bɛ hangi meal kun kan n’o tɛ tiɲɛ ye?","The correct answer is **C: Hangi bɛ labaara waatidɔw la ka sura jeninenw dilan** (Hangi is sometimes used to prepare baked meals).

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Hangi be labaara waatidɔw la ka ladala sura cɛnini dilan.""  ""ladala sura cɛnini dilan"" translates to preparing or cooking ""baked meals"". ""jeninenw"" is not in the statement

* **A is incorrect:** The passage doesn't mention fire being added to the geothermal steam to cook the hangi.
* **B is incorrect:** The passage states that the digɛn kalama(geothermal steam) dɔw (some) is found in Christchurch, Wellington. Not that the ""kalaman min bɛ fara kalamanw itilize"" (The geothermal steam used to cook meals) are found in Wellington
* **D is correct, but not the best answer:** ""Yɔrɔ camaw Rotorua kɔnɔ be digɛn kalama nin dugufutɛnti ye"" (Many places in Rotorua have geothermal steam and hot springs) is correct. The question asks which statement is NOT true, therefore D can't be the answer.
"
Nin jumɛn de ma fɔ nafɔ hangi dingɛ kalayaya cogoya yɛrɛyɛrɛ dɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: Gasi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions ""dugufutɛnti"" (earth's heat) as being associated with geothermal activity and specifically with digging holes in Rotorua.
*   The passage mentions ""digɛn kalama"" (hot spring), which is a direct result of earth's heat.
*   The passage suggests that digging is sometimes used to create private bathing spots.

The passage does not talk about any kind of ""Gasi"" and that is the correct answer."
Mun de bɛ seka kɛ Mɔwani walima masɛri ka lakodonni kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnen jaabi ye?,"The passage discusses appropriate attire for visiting monasteries. Here's a breakdown:

*   For women: To find a skirt to cover their knees and shoulders. Some monasteries provide coverings, but bringing your own (especially with varied colors) is preferable to avoid issues.
*   For men: To find pants that cover their knees.

Considering this, the best answer that addresses the attire issues for both men and women visiting the monastery is:

**D: Ka zupu dɔ don min bɛ kinkiriw sanfɛ** (To wear a skirt that covers the knees)

While the passage addresses men, the core of the question seems focused on the specific problem solved by the skirt. Options A and B are not as specific to what the text explains. C is not possible since the visitors must arrive with their own apparel.
"
Nin finidonta jumɛn sinka ta man telin ka sɔrɔ ka monasitɛri la? ,"Based on the passage, the answer is:

The passage specifically mentions asking men to wear pants that cover their knees.

Waati jumɛn lajɛlikɛla bɛna okaziyɔn ba sɔrɔ ka lolow ye tuma min na a bɛ ka Antarctic fanw lajɛ?,"The best answer here is **A: Tilemafɛ kalow waatila**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions seeing the polar night (""poli su ye, min kɔrɔ ko tile tɛ bɔ kɔrɔnfɛ""), which happens during the winter months. So, to see the polar night (and potentially auroras), you need to go during the winter. ""Tilemafɛ kalow waatila"" (winter months) aligns with this.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **B: Waati min yɔrɔw mɔgɔ man can ten** (When the places are not crowded): While the passage mentions fewer people, this isn't the primary reason for seeing the aurora.
*   **C: Fobɔnda kalow waati la** (Spring months): Spring is generally not when polar night happens.
*   **D: Waati min polisiyɔn fanga ka dɔgɔn** (When police power is low): This is irrelevant to aurora viewing."
Waati jumɛn telefɔni satelitima tɛna seka kɛ tɛlɛfɔni pɔritabulu nɔnabila ɲuman ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Ni bɛ sɔn ka kɛ**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Telefɔni satelitiman tɛ waatcamana tɛlɛfɔni pɔritabulu nɔnabila ye, inafɔ i kan ka bɔ kɛnɛma yɔrɔjɛlen na yɔrɔ mina i be sateliti ye ka apɛlikɛ."" which translates to ""Satellite phones are not always a good replacement for portable phones, as you need to be in a clear outdoor location where you can see the satellite to make a call."" This implies that satellite phones are not a good replacement if **bɛ sɔn ka kɛ**.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Ni yɔrɔ ka jan kojugun** (If the place is very far): The distance is irrelevant in the passage.
*   **C: Ni a bɛna seka baara kɛnɛma** (If it will work outdoors): The passage states it *needs* to work outdoors, so this is the opposite of the reason it wouldn't be a good replacement.
*   **D: Ni taa min bɛ sɔrɔ hakɛya dɔw ɲinni** (If some amount of travel is required): Travel is not mentioned."
Waati jumɛn telefɔni satelitima bɛ se ka kanu ni pɔritabulu ye?,"Based on the provided text (P), the best answer is **D: Waati min i ka telin ka erezo ma yɔrɔ sɔrɔ (Waati min i ka telin ka erezo ma yɔrɔ sɔrɔ)**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Yɔrɔ janw la, erezo tɛ yɔrɔ miununw ka, telefɔni satelitiman be seka latigɛ kelen dɔrɔn ye"" (In remote areas where there is no network, a satellite phone can be the only option). This directly implies that when you are out of network coverage, a satellite phone is useful.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Sɛgɛnɔbɔ waati duguba kɔnɔ (Sɛgɛnɔbɔ waati duguba kɔnɔ)**: The text doesn't mention anything about satellite phones being better than portables during emergencies in cities.
*   **B: Batɔnkɔnɔ-sɛgɛnafiyɛnbɔ waati (Batɔnkɔnɔ-sɛgɛnafiyɛnbɔ waati)**: While the text mentions rescue teams, it doesn't say satellite phones are *better* than portables in rescue situations, just that they use them due to the need for communication in remote locations.
*   **C: Waati min mago bɛ kunafoni jan na (Waati min mago bɛ kunafoni jan na)**: Again, the text mentions the need for long-distance communication, but this isn't necessarily a situation where a satellite phone is *better* than a portable, only that it's *used* in those situations *when no other options are available.*"
Nin jumɛn nɔfɛ mankan kɛra sababu ye ka Transnitria Jamana sigi sen kan?,"The correct answer is **B: Siyako** (Ethnicity).

The passage states: ""Maldive ye siya camaw jamana ye min sɛgɛ ko sababu kɛ siyako kɛlɛ ye. San 1994, nin kɛlɛ in kɛra sababu ye ka Transnistria jamana sigisenkan..."" which translates to ""Moldova is a multi-ethnic country which sometimes results in ethnic conflict. In 1994, this conflict was the reason for the establishment of the Transnistria country...""
"
Nin fɛn jumɛn kelen bɛ Transnistria Jamana bolo n’o ni Moldavvie fan tɔ tɛ kelen ye?  ,"The correct answer is **D: Waari**.

The text states: ""Transnistria jamana sigisenkan Maldive kɔrɔnyanfan fɛ, min ka gɔfɛrɛneman b'a bolo ani **waari** nka a ma kodɔn Diɲɛforobatɔnba jamana sifɛ."" (The Transnistria region declared independence in eastern Moldova, and its government controls its own territory and **currency** but is not recognized by most countries.)
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, waati jumɛ dugutaala ka kan Montevideo lajɛ ni u jigi bɛ a kan ka fuɲɔ fɛkɛn?","Let's analyze the passage to find the best time to visit Montevideo to avoid humidity.

The passage says:

*   Montevideo is in the Southern Hemisphere.
*   It's in the tropics, but close to the temperate zone.
*   Humidity can be oppressive. It's worse because of wind and cold that exaggerates the cool temperatures.
*   There are no distinct ""summer"" or ""winter"" seasons. Rainfall is distributed throughout the year.

Essentially, the passage highlights that high humidity can be oppressive in Montevideo. Therefore, you'd want to avoid times when humidity is likely to be highest. While the passage doesn't explicitly mention months with least humidity. It implicitly implies that any time you'd want to avoid is the hotter times of the year when humidity can be worse. Given the passage states that Montevideo is in the Southern Hemisphere and the context of avoiding humidity, the best answer would be:

**D: Montevideo fobonda kalow waati**

Explanation: ""Fobonda kalow"" (winter months) in the Southern Hemisphere correspond to months with relatively cooler temperatures, implying lower humidity than summer months. Avoiding the hot and humid times of year makes sense in the context of the passage."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, waati jɔn dugutaala ka kan ka Montevideo lajɛ ni nɛnɛ waati dɔni be?","The correct answer is **A: Waati min tilema bɛ Montevideo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Komi Montevideo be Equateur worodugu sanfa fɛ, tile de be kɛ o yɔrɔla..."". This translates to ""Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it has summer..."" Therefore, the best time to visit Montevideo for warmer weather is during their summer (""tilema"" in the passage).
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, nin jumɛ de bɛ seka fara ɲɔgɔn kan ni garafiti aritisi sigilen ye, ni a vandalisimu bɛli?","Based on the passage, the best answer is **C: Sɛbɛnninakoko min ma kanu foroba ta la** (Unwanted writings in public places).

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights the issue of graffiti being considered vandalism** - people are concerned about children defacing public and private property.
* **The passage distinguishes between graffiti art and ""illegal"" acts.** The passage mentions graffiti artists (""girafiti kɛlaw kodɔnlenw, girafiti tulɔnkɛbaaraw ani kokow """"dagalenw"""""") creating designs.
* **Option C captures the negative perception** that many have toward graffiti, viewing it as something unwanted in public spaces. It reflects the core conflict in the passage: the tension between graffiti as art and graffiti as vandalism.

The other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ko Graffiti** - while true, it is too broad.
*   **B: Sɛnni jɛgɛnnen** - This is too limited as it only mentions painting.
*   **D: Sɛbɛnni minnu tɛ seka kalan** - This is too narrow, as graffiti can be legible.

This directly translates to ""trying to secure a spot at music festivals is considered a high priority for attendees, and many attendees do not consider it worth the effort."" Thus, securing a spot is considered important.

The passage explicitly states: ""Nin i be fɛka ka kɛ tulɔnbaaraw gɛrɛfɛ, i kan kana jɔna walasa ka sigiyɔrɔ sɔrɔ dɔngili gɛrɛfɛ"" which means ""If you want to be near the performers, don't stop in order to get a place near the music"".

The passage states: ""Janto ala: dugu fitiniw bariw yan tɛ waatibɛɛ yɔrɔ ɲumanw ye ka ɲɛsin lajɛlikɛla dunaw ma"" which translates to ""Note: small, rural towns are not always good places for tourist destinations.""

This translates to ""However, the casinos mentioned above sell refreshments, and many are near a famous tourist landmark (Especially large hot air balloon rally near Albuquerque and Santa Fe)"". It directly links casinos near Santa Fe with tourist attractions.
*   The other options are less supported:
    *   A: The passage mentions a lack of nightlife but doesn't say anything about a 2-hour drive from Albuquerque leading to tourist attractions.
    *   B: The passage mentions long stretches of highway but does not imply they are tourist destinations.
    *   D: The passage actually warns that smaller rural towns may *not* be good destinations for tourists."
Wari utilize cogo ɲuman kadi woyasikɛla minnu ye olu bɛ se k’a kanu ka minfɛn suguya juman to?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **D: Jiriden nɔnɔ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jiriden nɔnɔ ka gɛlɛ nka ka di"" which translates to ""Fruit juice is difficult but delicious"". It doesn't specify *who* likes it, but the other options are more directly tied to specific locations or anxieties.

*   **A: Ɔsitarali dɔlɔ** (Australian beer) - While Australians are mentioned in relation to coffee, there is no mention of Australian beer in the passage.
*   **B: Bidɔn kɔnɔ ji** (Water in a bidon) - The passage mentions that it is ""scary"" to drink water from the bidon (""bidɔn kɔnɔ sɔrɔkadi nin i be siran""), meaning that people who like to travel would not find it appealing.
*   **C: Yɔrɔ biyɛri** (Local beer) - ""Yɔrɔ gulɔ yɛrɛ yɛrɛ ye """"Number One"""" ye, o tekɛ gulɔ gɛlɛ ye, nka a kadi ani a be farifoni."" This translates to ""Local beer is 'Number One', it is a tough beer but delicious and refreshing"". This tells us that the beer is delicious and refreshing, but doesn't make it appealing specifically to people who travel.

Therefore, fruit juice is the best choice as it is described to be delicious.

"Kulu jumɛn y’e Kolonizasiyɔn daminɛ, min janyara fɔ ka se san kɛmɛsaba ma?","The correct answer is **D: Ɛsipaɲɔliw**.

*   It then also says ""Paris kaw ka yɛrɛminɛ be tunu nin i ye taboloɲuman dɔw jira."" which means Parisians will appreciate it when you show good table manners.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Parisian society values individuality and togetherness. It highlights the importance of being well-mannered and acting like a ""person of the world"" (someone well-educated and cultured).
*   The passage specifically mentions that a lack of good manners is a problem and that showing good manners can help one be accepted and navigate Parisian society. The last sentence also mentions that ""Parisians' *yɛrɛminɛ* be tunu nin i ye taboloɲuman dɔw jira,"" or ""Parisians' self-esteem will increase when they see your good manners.""
*   While the passage mentions individuality (yɛrɛbaya) and togetherness (kafalenya) as valued aspects of Paris society, *yɛrɛminɛ* is something that is *increased* by good manners, indicating that a lack of it would be frowned upon and is therefore not a trait that Parisian society tends to value.
*   While Tonlo ni yɛlɛ might also be valued, it is not mentioned in the passage at all, making it impossible to deduce an answer from the options.

Thus, *yɛrɛminɛ* is the only option which implies a negative consequence from its absence in the passage."
Kulu fɔlɔ nafa ye mun ye Cape Town MetroRail kan?,"The correct answer is **A: Kɔlɔsiliba bɛ tɛrɛn ɲɛfɛ** (Security is available on the train).

The passage states: ""MetroPlus kɔlɔsilikɛlaw be waatibɛɛ tirɛn dan na Cape Town gɛrɛfɛ"" which translates to ""MetroPlus security is always on the train in Cape Town"". Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer based on the information provided.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun bɛ Cape Town baarayɔrɔ-ta tɛrɛn kelen kelen bɛɛ kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **D: Kulu fɔlɔ ani kulu filanan kɔlɔsilibaw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Metroplus ani Metro kɔlɔsilibaw be tirɛn bɛɛ kɔnɔ"" which translates to ""MetroPlus and Metro guards are in all trains."" The question askes what is in each train and the answer clearly states there are guards. MetroPlus is known as First Class and Metro is known as Third Class, so the answer is that first and second class have guards.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage states that MetroPlus has improved safety and comfort, while Metro is cheaper and more basic. So it is not one metro coach that does not have comfort.
*   **B:** The passage doesn't state if the prices of the trains are the same.
*   **C:** The passage states that there are two classes of trains, not three."
Fɛnɲɛnɛmanin kinikɛla man telin ka nin fɛn juman kelen kɛ?,"Based on the information provided in statement P, the correct answer is **D: Ka banadilidaw nati fan ni fanga la**.

Here's why:

*   Statement P indicates that foods can cause allergies, sickness, or change medications. It DOES NOT say foods can CREATE medications.
*   Statement P indicates foods can cause allergies, sickness, and change medications, that is not creating medications.
*   Options A, B, and C are specifically mentioned as potential negative effects of foods in statement P.
*   Option D talks about foods creating medications.

Therefore, because foods do not fall under ""medication manufacturers"" as per the passage, they would not be expected to manufacture new medicines."
Telefɔni pisi perepeye bɛ san yɔrɔ jumɛn?,"The correct answer is **A: Jamana kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnen la** (In specific countries).

The passage states: ""...dɔw sipesiyalizeleno wele nɔgɔmani dilila piriw la ka jamana kulu kɛrɛnkɛrɛni dɔw la"" which means ""some specialized call features were created in these chips for certain groups of countries"". This implies that prepaid phone chips are tailored to specific countries.
"
Keredi minnu bɛ wele nɔgɔman piriw di olu bɛ sirasɔrɔ cogo di?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: U bɛ sirasɔrɔ jamana kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnen dɔw de la**.

The passage states that some special calling card providers design cards to ease calls to specific countries. Therefore, access is limited to specific countries.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, nin jiri kelen jumɛn man can Plitvice Lakes dugu pariki kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **B: Bunbun**.

The passage states that Plitvice Lakes National Park is a unique blend of **heather**, **spruce**, and **fir** trees, as well as a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation. ""Bunbun"" is not mentioned in the passage as one of the tree types found in the park.
"
Nin kunko soko sɔrɔbali jumɛn kelen bɛ sɔrɔ Plitvice Lakes dugu pariki kɔnɔ?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

The passage mentions ""tetara belebele ba"" which translates to ""great capercaillie"". Therefore, capercaillie (D) is found in Plitvice Lakes National Park.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, maarayɔrɔ kɔdiw b’i dɛmɛ ka mun kɛ?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**D: Kopiyeli kɔnnen**

The passage explicitly states: ""Tiɲɛla, maarayɔrɔw kɔdiw tɛ kɔlɔlɔ foyi nati kopiyeli kɔnlen la"" which translates to ""However, library codes do not protect against copying."" This directly indicates that library codes are designed to prevent copying.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, nin fɛn jumɛn kelen ye nkalon ye kunafonidi baarayɔrɔ bɛ tilen ka min tikɛ maarayɔrɔ kodiw kun kan?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: U ka dɔkɔn u ka se ka suɲɛli kunbɛn**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""...a dabɔra ka """"suyɛnli kunbɛ"""". Tiɲɛla, maarayɔrɔw kɔdiw tɛ kɔlɔlɔ foyi nati kopiyeli kɔnlen la..."" This translates to: ""...it was created to ""fight against copying"". However, software codes are not resistant to illegal copying...""
*   This directly contradicts the statement that the software is effective at preventing copying. Therefore, option D is the false statement.

The other options are supported by the passage:

*   **A: U b’a to ni se be di suku kuna** (They allow access to school accounts) - This aligns with the passage stating ""...Nin kun ye ka se di baarakɛyɔrɔw ma u ka sukuw kuna..."" (This is to give access to workspaces to their school accounts).
*   **B: U b’an dɛmɛ ka kopiyeli kɔnnen kunbɛn** (They help us combat copying) - This is close to what the passage says was the intention, even though the reality is that they don't actually prevent copying.
*   **C: U nafa ka bon tɔnɔ sɔrɔli la** (They are important for profit making) - This aligns with the passage stating ""...a bɛɛ be tɔnɔ sɔrɔ kuna"" (everyone profits from them)."
Lajɛli tɛmɛsiran jumɛn ye tɔgɔ dɔrɔn ye waati min ni bɛ ka se i ka jamana kɔnɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: Imigirasiyɔn mɔgɔw ka lajɛliw**

The passage states ""Ali na sɔrɔ imigirasiyɔn mɔgɔw ka lajɛliw tɛ yi waaticamana walima ye tɔgɔ dɔrɔn de ye tumamina nin i sera i ka jamanala..."" which directly translates to ""Even though immigration interviews may not be formal or just a formality when you arrive in your country..."". This confirms that immigration interviews can be a formality upon arrival.
"
I ka kan nin fɛn kelen jumɛn dɔn sani i bɛ se i ka jamana kɔnɔ?,"The most appropriate answer based on the given text is **B: Ni mako b’a la ka fɛnw kofɔ minnu bɛ tɛmɛ sariya dan kan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights the challenges faced at customs when arriving in a country, especially regarding items exceeding legal limits.** It states that customs checks can be difficult and that it's crucial to know what's allowed and not allowed to bring into the country.  The phrase ""fɛnw bɛɛ kofɛ minunw tɛmɛleno sariya danakan"" directly addresses items exceeding legal limits.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ni imigirasiyɔn mɔgɔw sɛgɛsɛliyɔrɔ dɔ bɛ na kɛ yen (If there is an immigration inspection area there):** The focus of the question is about what one should know about what is within or exceeding legal limits. Although immigration is related, the context focuses more on what one brings into the country
*   **C: Ni duwaɲɛw ka sɛgɛsɛliyɔrɔ bena kɛ yen (If there will be a customs inspection there):** This is too general. The passage is concerned with specific issues relating to customs (items exceeding legal limits).
*   **D: Ni bɛ ka na ni fɛn ye min yamaruyalen tɛ ka don (If you are coming with something that is not allowed to enter):** Again, the passage is concerned with limits and amounts of items within or beyond legal limits. Not just things that are entirely disallowed.

Therefore, **B** is the most accurate response as it directly reflects the passage's concern with declaring items that may exceed legal limits.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, fɛn jumɛn caya b’a to kuluyɛlɛlaw bɛ ka siraw lakodɔn tuma o tuma Cochamo Valley kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **D: Kokow (Rocks)**.

The passage states: ""Kuluyɛlɛlaw kabɔ diɲɛ fan bɛɛ fɛ beka sira kura dilan o **kɔkɔw** nafan dandɔbalila."" This translates to: ""Climbers from all over the world are creating new routes because of the **rocks**' endless potential.""

The abundance and potential of the rocks in Cochamo Valley are the reason climbers are constantly discovering and creating new routes.
"
"Ka sinsin nin kibaruyadilen ye tɛmɛ sira kɔnɔ, jɔnni bɛ taamaden latɛmɛ caman kɛ worodugu bolo Kan?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that no airline alliance except Star Alliance covers the entire South Pacific route from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti (which is LATAM Oneworld's territory).
*   The question asks about the alliance that covers the most areas within the northern part. Since it's mentioned Star Alliance has a fan that stretches into the southern pacific, it can be assumed that it is likely to have the most coverage."
Pankurun cakɛda jɛkulu jumɛn bɛ kɔgɔji latɛmɛ fitininni ta worodugu bolo?,"Based on the passage, Star Alliance is the only airline alliance that crosses a significant portion of the South Pacific, specifically from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which LATAM Oneworld also covers. However, the question asks which alliance *minimally* crosses the south. So, the answer is:

**C: LATAM Oneworld**

Here's why:

*   **LATAM Oneworld:** The passage states that the Santiago de Chile to Tahiti route is within LATAM Oneworld's scope. Because we know that it only takes *one* airline alliance to cross a certain amount of the pacific to answer the question, we know that LATAM Oneworld *does* cross at least some of the Pacific.
*   **Star Alliance:** While they cross a large section, the question asks for the *least* amount.
*   **SkyTeam:** The passage directly states that SkyTeam does not cross the south pacific.
*   **South Pacific:** The South Pacific is a *location* not an airline alliance."
Taama cakɛda jumɛn tugunna Global Running Tours la?,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

The passage states: ""The Global Running Tours nɔnbila, Go Running Tours be baara kɛ nin kɛbaw tani dama damaniw ye..."". This translates to ""Associated with Global Running Tours, Go Running Tours works with about ten entrepreneurs..."" This implies that Go Running Tours is associated with, but separate from Global Running Tours.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, Go Running Tours b’a dɛmɛ ka jɛɲɔgɔnya don turisimu cakɛda hakɛ joli nin ɲɔgɔn cɛ?","The correct answer is **A: Naani**.

The passage states ""Go Running Tours be baara kɛ nin kɛbaw tani dama damaniw ye kontian **naani** bɛɛ kɔnɔ"" which means ""Go Running Tours works with **dozens** of companies in all **four** continents"". The question asks about continents, so the answer is four (naani)."
Turisi ka kan ka mun kɛ n’u jigi bɛ waraninkalan filɛlikɛnɛ mun bɛ sɛn ka jɛ n’a bɛ ye Kan?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **D: Mɔbili ta ani sariya minɛnw labaara**. Here's why:

The text says: ""Waranikalaw be maloya waatidɔw la ani i bena sekana u ye kaɲɛ nin lupuw ye."" This translates to ""Leopards are shy at times, and you will be able to hunt them with good luck."". This indicates that dealing with potentially dangerous animals like leopards requires caution and potentially hunting.  Since hunting is not possible, the best way to manage this is through the use of a vehicle and following rules (sariya minɛnw labaara).

The other options are less relevant:

*   **A & B:** While going to the Farafina bush is relevant to the context of the entire document, these options don't address what should be done specifically when encountering leopards.
*   **C:** Jasaman nunɛti labaara is not relevant at all and I can't seem to find it in the original text."
"Ka sinsin nin tɛmɛ sira ye, kungokɔnɔbagan jumɛn nin turisi ka teli ka ɲɔgɔn ye farafinna kungofilɛ senfɛ k’u to bolimafɛn kɔnɔ?","Based on the passage, the animals mentioned that tourists are likely to encounter while in vehicles in African safaris are:

*   **Samaw (Elephants)**
*   **Ntilenw (Giraffes)**

The passage also mentions:

*   **Waraw (Lions)**
*   **Waraninkalanw (Leopards)**

The passage specifically states that lions and leopards might be shy at times, and you might be lucky to see them. However, elephants and giraffes are described as getting close to the vehicles.

Therefore, the best answer, considering ""teli ka ɲɔgɔn ye"" (likely to encounter) and the context of the passage, is **A: Warabaw (Elephants)**. It appears the word *waraw* (lion) was mistranslated as *warabaw* (elephants). Elephants are described as being closer to the vehicles, indicating a higher likelihood of encounter.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni sɛbɛn nin ye, mun tun bɛ sɛn ka taama musaka lajigin?","The correct answer is **D: Ka mɔgɔ wɔɔrɔ walima caman jɛkulu ɲinin**.

Here's why:

* **P: Turuw ka ɲɔgɔ nin kulubaw ye, ola nin nin i be kelen na walima nin terikɛ kelen ye, a ɲinin i ka mɔgɔ tɔw dɔn ani ka mɔgɔ naani walima wɔɔrɔ kulu dɔ dilan walasa ka mɔgɔ kelen piri ɲuman sɔrɔ.** This part of the text is saying to travel in groups of four or six to get a better individual price.  The larger the group, the cheaper it is per person.

* The rest of the passage explains the importance of not letting travel costs increase, and warns of the potential for being scammed if the per-person cost is not properly negotiated.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jɔnni ka teli ka taama siɲɛ hakɛ bɛɛ la caman sɔrɔ?","Based on the passage, the best answer is **D: Mɔgɔ duuru jɛkulu (A group of five people)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly suggests forming groups of ""mɔgɔ naani walima wɔɔrɔ kulu dɔ dilan (a group of four or five people)"" to get the best per-person price (mɔgɔ kelen piri ɲuman sɔrɔ).
*   The passage discusses how it's economical to fill a vehicle.
*   The other options aren't as directly supported:
    *   A: ""Turisi minnu b’a fɛ ka mɔbili falen falen kɛ"" describes someone who wants to fill a vehicle, but doesn't provide a number.
    *   B: ""Mɔgɔ saba jɛkulu"" is smaller than the group suggested in the passage (four or five).
    *   C: ""Terima fila bɛ ka taama ɲɔgɔn fɛ"" only mentions two friends traveling, which is a smaller group.

Therefore, a group of five is closest to the ideal group size for sharing costs."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun ye San Francisco tɔgɔbɔli dɛmɛn jiɲɛ kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **A: Yeli sabatilen sekonindɔnko ani kunnafonidi sira caman na** (Established appearance in songs, films, and literature).

The passage states: ""Waatila dɔngili, filimuw ani sɛbɛeniw ɲɛfɔli ani tabolo kodɔnlen y'a dugu dɛmɛ ka ɲɛnɛmaya ani a tamasiyɛnw dɔnlen diɲɛ fanbɛɛ."" This directly supports option A. The passage mentions songs, films, literature, and well-known tales as contributing to San Francisco's fame. The other options are mentioned in the passage but not as main reasons for the city's global recognition.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni sɛbɛn nin ye, mankutu jumɛn tɛ tiɲɛ ye San Francisco kan?","Based on the passage, here's the analysis of each statement:

*   **A: A bɔra ka caya jaw nin gafew kɔnɔ (It has appeared frequently in songs and movies):** This is TRUE. The passage explicitly states ""Waatila dɔngili, filimuw ani sɛbɛeniw ɲɛfɔli ani tabolo kodɔnlen y'a dugu dɛmɛ ka ɲɛnɛmaya ani a tamasiyɛnw dɔnlen diɲɛ fanbɛɛ"" (Songs, movies and recognized tables have helped the city's culture and made its landmarks known throughout the world).

*   **B: Azikaw ka dumuni fanga ka bon (Asian cuisine is influential):** This is TRUE. The passage states: ""San Francisco ye fɛnɛ jamana yɔrɔba dɔ ye nin Asie dumuniw ye: Koree, Thailande, Inde ani Japon dumuniw."" (San Francisco is a great country with Asian foods: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese foods).

*   **C: Dunanjiginsow nin jamalajɛrɛsobaw caman bɛ ye (There are many gardens and museums):** This is TRUE. The passage states ""San Francisco ye turusi infirasirikiti ba camaw dilan nin ɔtɛli camaw ye, dugunikɛyɔrɔw, ani yɔrɔbaw minunw be diɲɛ yɔrɔbaw jɔcogo bato"" (San Francisco has developed major tourist infrastructure with many hotels, gardens and places that celebrate the architecture of great places in the world).

*   **D: Sɔrɔkosiratikɛ sinsinnen don turisimu kan (The economy is based on tourism):** This is likely TRUE, but the passage states that the economy relies on many services, including government, trade, finance, industry and tourism. So the statement that it is ONLY based on tourism is false.

Therefore, the answer is **D: Sɔrɔkosiratikɛ sinsinnen don turisimu kan**."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, taamaden suguya jumɛn man teli ka nafasɔrɔ taama cakɛla ka baaraw la?","The correct answer is **C: Taamaden mun m’a ka jamanadonsɛbɛn sɔrɔ (Taamaden min ka jamana donsɛbɛn sɔrɔ)**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that travel agents can assist with document needs like visas. If a traveler lacks necessary travel documents (like a visa), they would greatly benefit from the travel agent's services.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Taamaden sigasigala:** While a new traveler might find help from a travel agent, it's not the most directly implied benefit in the passage.
*   **B: Taamaden min ka teli ka yɛrɛkunnakow kɛ:** A traveler who likes to do the planning themselves would be less inclined to use a travel agent.
*   **D: Taamaden mun b’a kanun donin ci kɛ:** The text does not directly say that a traveler who likes to tip is more likely to benefit from travel agents' services."
Ninnu na jumɛn ma kofɔ tɛmɛ sira kɔnɔ inafɔ cili nafa taama cakɛla fɛ?,"The correct answer is **A: Donin ci sɛbɛnw**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""U be seka maralikɛkabila i ɲ nin i mako be waatila ka miri sɛriwisi in kan walima ka sɛbɛn dɔ ɲinin ka t'i tayɔrɔla (misalila: wiza)."" which translates to ""They can also manage for you if you need a service to get a document for your trip (for example: visa)."" This clearly indicates that obtaining documents is a benefit offered to travelers.
*   The passage does not directly mention obtaining Dunanjiginsow (B), Donin taata bɛɛ (C), or Sigiyɔrɔ minɛlen tali (D) as a service provided by the travel agent.

Therefore, ""Donin ci sɛbɛnw"" (obtaining documents) is the service most directly implied as a benefit in the passage."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kanbayɛlɛmali a nɔla apilikasiyɔn tɛ sɛn ka mun kɛ?","The correct answer is **D: Ka kanbayɛlɛmali ka ɲɛ 100% waati bɛɛ la**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""kanbayɛlɛma mansiw talaɲɛ kosɛbɛ kosɛbɛ, ani be waatidɔw la kanbayɛlɛmali ɲuman di cogodɔla (ani cogoya gɛlɛna mana manakan), nka jateminɛ dɔw mako beyi, inafɔ u be sek'a bɛɛ ɲagamu fɛnɛ"" which translates to: ""Translation is very varied, and sometimes provides a good translation (even if the subject matter is complex), but some adjustments are needed, as they can completely confuse things"". This implies that translations are not always perfect.

The other options are things the applications *can* do:
*   **A: Taamasyɛnw kɔrɔ fɔli kan wɛrɛw la:** This corresponds to the line ""Apilikasiyɔn dɔw nin bɔnda in kɔnɔ be seka masalabolow bayɛlɛma kɔfɛ kanw la tamasiyɛnw walima fɛn wɛrɛw kuna diɲɛ kɔnɔ nin a baaralikɛba ye telefɔni ɲɛsin fɛnw dɔw ma"" (""Some of the applications in this set can translate messages and texts on devices such as phones"")

(""Instant language translation applications - applications that can translate large sections of text at once from one language to another."")
*   **C: Ka masala min bɛ minɛnw kan bayɛlɛma nin smartphone ye:** This corresponds to the line ""Apilikasiyɔn dɔw nin bɔnda in kɔnɔ be seka masalabolow bayɛlɛma kɔfɛ kanw la tamasiyɛnw walima fɛn wɛrɛw kuna diɲɛ kɔnɔ nin a baaralikɛba ye telefɔni ɲɛsin fɛnw dɔw ma"" (""Some of the applications in this set can translate messages and texts on devices such as phones"")"
Mun b’a kanbayɛlɛmali daga ka ķɛ ɛntɛrinɛti kɔfɛ?,"Based on the provided text (P), the answer is **A: Kanbayɛlɛmali masinw (Translation machines)**.

The passage states: ""...min kanyɛlɛmali danga ɛntɛrɛni kɔfɛ tumamina nin ye kan kunafoniw ɲininlen terisarize"" which translates to ""...whose translation depends on the internet to search for linguistic information in real time"". This clearly indicates that translation machines (which is what Google Translate is, and the passage discusses) rely on the internet for their translation capabilities.
"
Ninnu na jumɛn tɛ jikuruyurundu sababu ye?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **A: Nɛzi siminen**.

The passage mentions:

*   ""Kunbalan ye min ye ko nɛzi be kole, ola o mako fɛn dɔw la ka jigin, ani nɛzi dɔw jiginli be seka kunw ye ka tɔw ben."" (Some needs are causes of fall, and some falls cause others to fall) - This relates to **D: Nɛzibin wɛrɛ** (other waterfalls)
*   ""Waatidɔwla, benli kun ye tile kɛli ye ka nɛzi kalaya..."" (Sometimes, the reason for the fall is the sun shining on the waterfall...) - This relates to **C: Tilejɛ** (sunlight)
*   ""waatidɔw la adamaden dɔ."" (Sometimes a person) - This relates to **B: Mɔgɔw** (people)

The passage does not mention ""nɛzi siminen"" (waterfall construction) as a cause of waterfalls falling.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu na jumɛn bɛ na inafɔ jikuruyurundu?","The passage (P) states: ""Nɛzi benw ye fɛn ye min tɛ nɔrimali ye; sira yɛlɛkajigi garolen be seka sumayalikɛ, ani hakɛya damatɛmɛlen bena ben inafɔ nɛzi benw.""

This translates to: ""Landslides are not normal events; heavy rainfall can cause landslides, and excessive erosion can lead to landslides.""

Therefore, the option that best describes something that would *cause* a landslide, according to the passage, is:

*   **C: Nɛzi hakɛ camanba sira sanfɛ (A large amount of erosion on the road surface)**. This aligns with the statement that excessive erosion (hakɛya damatɛmɛlen) can lead to landslides.
*    **B: Sira yɛlɛkajigi garolen nɛzi tɛ min na (Heavy rainfall in the presence of erosion)**. This aligns with the statement that heavy rainfall (sira yɛlɛkajigi garolen) can cause landslides.

Options A and D are consequences of landslides, not causes.

Given the information, **B** is the best answer as the passage refers to both rainfall and erosion as causes of landslides.
"
"ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, curry nan kolo ye nan fɛn jumɛn ye?","The correct answer is **A: Yawuri ani ji**.

The passage states: ""Inde ani Pakistan kɔkɔdugu yanfan kɔnɔna maarayɔrɔw kɔnɔ, yawuri be dɔn waaticamana nin curry ye..."" and ""...Curry be seka """"ja"""" walima """"ɲikin"""" ka da ji hakɛya min be k'ala kan.""
"
"Marabolo dɔw kɔnɔ, kokoji bɛ bila nafɛn jumɛn nɔna waati dɔw la curry nanna?","The correct answer is **C: Yawuri**.

The passage states: ""Inde ani Pakistan kɔkɔdugu yanfan kɔnɔna maarayɔrɔw kɔnɔ, yawuri be dɔn waaticamana nin curry ye; Inde worodugu yanfan fɛ ani kontinan fitini jidala maarayɔrɔ dɔw la, kako nɔnɔ de be itilize.""

This means that in some regions (India and Pakistan), yogurt is commonly used in curry, while coconut milk is used in other regions.
"
Munna mununmununyɔrɔ min dɔ bɛ Transantarctic Mountains kɛrɛ la b’a to i bɛ bɔ fuga kan?,"Based on the information provided in passage P, the correct answer is **C: Mɔbili donintalan kɛrɛnkɛrɛnw man telin (Special vehicles are not efficient).**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""O woyasi be seka kɛ nin tirakitɛri kɛrɛnkɛrɛnlenw ye, jiri samataw nin taji ani fɛnw ye. U **ma makan kosɛbɛ**, ola sira janya ka tɛmɛ Transantartic Mountains gɛrɛfɛ walasa ka ta kulu la.""

This translates to: ""This journey can be made with special tractors, sledges, fuel, and materials. **They are not very efficient**, and the journey is long because it goes through the Transantarctic Mountains to avoid climbing.""

The passage mentions that the journey goes *around* the Transantarctic Mountains because the vehicles are not very efficient for climbing. This directly answers the question of why the route skirts the mountains instead of going over them.

The other options are incorrect:

*   A: McMurdo Station da tugulen don waati caman (McMurdo Station is closed for a long time) - The passage doesn't say the station is closed, it uses it as a start point for the Traverse.
*   B: Nɛzi jalen tɛ sɔn (Frozen land is not accepted) - This doesn't make sense in the context and isn't supported by the passage.
*   D: A ka nɔgɔn nin taama ye Ross Sea kanna ye (It is easy to walk on the Ross Sea side) - The passage doesn't say it is easy. It states the traverse goes around the Transantarctic Mountains, implying it is difficult to traverse it.

Therefore, the best answer is **C**.
"
"South Pole Traverse jɔ fɛ, mun taamasyɛnnen don jɔnjɔnw fɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Diŋɛ juguw faalen nɛzi la**.

The passage states that the South Pole Traverse ""ye nɛzi faralen ye ɲɔgɔnkan nin digɛnw minunw falen o ani tamasiyɛnlen no nin dirapow ye."" This clearly indicates that the traverse consists of compacted snow with ice hollows, drifts, and soft spots.  Therefore, it is marked by dangerous ice formations filled with snow.
"

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states ""...mɔbili 4 x 4 de laɲini neno kosɛbɛ..."" which translates to ""...a 4x4 vehicle is highly recommended..."".
*   While the other options are mentioned in the text, they are not the main point for tourists to be aware of when exploring North Africa by car.
* Option A is correct and mentioned in the text, it says: ""Visa ɲininfɛnw an'a sɔngɔn be yɛlɛma kabɔ jamanaw dɔ la ka ta jamana dɔ la ani be ɛnfiliyanse nin i beka jamana mina ye."" Which translates to ""Visa requirements and their costs vary from country to country, and depend on the country you are from.""
* Option B is correct and mentioned in the text, it says: ""Dɔnila Farafina Wɔrɔdugu yanfan fɛ mɔbilila ye cogoya ɲuman ba ye k'o maraw cɛnan ye ani ka se yɔrɔw la minunw tɛ kɛ turisiw tɛmɛ siraw la."" Which translates to ""Traveling by car across North Africa is a good way to explore the region and access places that are not on the usual tourist routes.""
* Option C is correct and mentioned in the text, it says: ""a gɛrɛfɛ jamanaw bɛ tɛ."" Which translates to ""and neighboring countries are not"".

Therefore, while all the options are mentioned, the 4x4 recommendation is the most important piece of information for a tourist planning this type of trip."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun bɛ se ka jate nafɔ bilasirali jugu ka ɲɛsin turisi ma minnu b’a ɲini ka farafinna worodugu yala?","The correct answer is **A: Mobili kɔnɔ jatigɛla yɛrɛdɛmɛ fɛnw bɛ wajibiya sariya fɛ.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Jamana kelenw kelenw ka sariya kɛrɛnkɛrɛni fɛnɛ beyi min jatogola yɛrɛdɛmɛ fɛnw minunw kan ka kɛ mɔbili kɔnɔ."" (Each country has specific laws regarding mandatory self-sufficient items that must be in the vehicle.) This directly supports answer A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hali ni 4x4 laɲini neno, yɔrɔ camanw bɛ sɔrɔ ni bɛ mɔbili gansan:** While the passage mentions that a standard vehicle is possible, it also emphasizes the strong preference for a 4x4 vehicle, especially for reaching remote areas.
*   **C: Mɔbili woyasi kaɲi kosɛbɛ mɔgɔw ma minnu b’a ɲini ka sirakɔrɔw bila:** While useful, it's not a legal necessity.
*   **D: Farafinna Worodugu yanfan lamini jamanaw bɛɛ lajɛli tɛ hakika ye:** The passage refers to visa and other legal requirements that vary from one country to another. Therefore, it's very much possible that there will be certain requirements in some countries that might not be there in others."
Nin fɛn juman kelen ma fɔ tɛmɛsiran in kɔnɔ n’o bɛ se ka kɛ farati ye ka kɛɲɛ ni minɛnw bilali yɔrɔ la ɲɛ t’a yɔrɔ min?,"The correct answer is **C: U bɛ sa ka ɲagami mɔgɔwɛrɛ taw la** (They can cause you to be confused with other people).

Let's analyze why:

*   **A: U bɛ se ka soɲa (They can cause you to be suspected):** The passage explicitly states that carrying items without permission can make you a target, especially when crossing borders. So, suspicion is a mentioned risk.
*   **B: I bɛ se ka i yɛrɛ sɔrɔ ni dɔrɔku ye kasɔrɔ i ma bɔ a kalama (You can find yourself with drugs without even knowing):** This is directly mentioned in the passage: ""I be se kana i yɛrɛ sɔrɔ nin durɔgu ye ka sɔrɔ i ma bɔ a kalama...""
*   **D: Famaw bɛ se ka filɛ nafɔ bɔmu farati dɔ (Families can suffer from bomb threats):** The passage explicitly mentions the items can be used to carry bombs.

**C** is the only option that isn't directly stated or implied as a risk in the passage. The passage does not mention that it is possible to be confused with other people."
Mun ma fɔ tɛmɛsira in kɔnɔ ka ɲɛsin i yɛrɛsɔrɔli ni dɔrɔgu ye?,"The correct answer is **D: Fangaw bɛ se ka i ka fɛnw minnɛ i la, hali ni dɔrɔgu t’i kun.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: **""I be se kana i yɛrɛ sɔrɔ nin durɔgu ye ka sɔrɔ i ma bɔ a kalama, min bena i dɔn kunbalan baw la.""** This means you can be found in possession of drugs without knowing it, leading to serious consequences. This directly implies authorities can confiscate your possessions even if you are not intentionally involved with drugs.

Let's look at the other options:

*   A: Jamana dɔw kɔnɔ, sariyasɔsɔlafɔlɔw bɛ se ka ɲangi ni si kaso - While the passage mentions potential severe penalties, including life imprisonment, it doesn't specifically focus on accidentally being found with drugs.
*   B: Jantoli labɛn ka kan ka kɛ n’i bɛna woyase diɲɛ kɔnɔ - This is a general suggestion to protect yourself against accidental exposure to dangerous substances, but the text doesn't say something about it directly.
*   C: Dɔrɔku kasasama wuluw bɛ se ka utilize kasɔrɔ i t’a kalama - This is a real thing but the passage doesn't imply anything about it."
Minfɛn nɔgɔmani juman kelen ma fɔ n’o bɛ se ka kɛ fɛn ye i bɛ se ka lajɛ ka min dilan sɔkɔnɔkɔnse waati?,"The correct answer is **A: Jirinɔnɔ (Juice)**.

The passage specifically mentions taking the opportunity to ""ɲagama jirinɔnɔ walima jirinɔnɔ gosilen dɔ ɲɔgɔna"" (mixing juice or smoothie). The other options are either mentioned as things to avoid (kafe - coffee) or not mentioned at all (biyeri - beer). Te (tea) is also mentioned as being a calming drink for the evening, not for the morning.
"
I ka kan ka ta nin fɛn juman kelen lajɛ sɔkɔnɔkɔnse waati n’i ka dugu dɔnnen bɛ n’a ka minfɛn tabolo ye?,"The answer is **B: Jirinɔnɔ walima jirinɔnɔ gosilen fereyɔrɔ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically suggests enjoying a ""jirinɔnɔ walima jirinɔnɔ gosilen dɔ ɲagama ɲɔgɔna"" (juice or smoothie) when taking a break.
*   The passage states ""In i balolen dugu dɔ kɔnɔ nin minfɛn camaw tabolo ye, ta bariw la walima minfɛn yɔrɔw gɛrɛfɛralaw la i tɛ ta minunw na."", this refers to the abundance of readily available drinks when you are in a town with stores.

The other options are not directly suggested as the best choice during the break:

*   **A: Kafe-fereyɔrɔ min b’i ka sigida kɔfɛ** (Coffee shop in your area) - The passage mentions that you already have too much coffee, so this is not suggested.
*   **C: I tɛ deli ka ta bari minnu na** (Bars you don't frequent) - The passage suggest to avoid taking things you don't need
*   **D: Dumuni fere yɔrɔ min bɛ kamomili te wili** (A place where you can get chamomile tea) - The passage explicitly states that you take chamomile tea at night, not during the day."
Tubani dilannenw bɛ yɔrɔ juman?,"The correct answer is **B: Egilizi kuru kɔnɔ**.

The passage states: ""Egilizi kuru kɔnɔ, tuganiw kabaru dilane ɲuman beyi kaburuw sanfɛ."" This directly translates to ""Inside the churchyard, beautiful tombstone carvings are over the graves."" Therefore, the carvings (tuganiw kabaru dilane) are located inside the churchyard (egilizi kuru kɔnɔ).
"
Wiza suguya juman b’a laɲini i ka na ni waari perewu ye min b’a jira k’i bɛ s’i yɛrɛ kɔrɔ?,"The correct answer is **D: Kalanden wisa**.

The passage specifically states ""...ani waari pirewu k'i si yɛrɛ kɔrɔ san kelen boɲɔgɔngola i ka kalan kɔnɔ"" within the context of discussing requirements for **kalanden wizaw (student visas)**. None of the other visa types are mentioned in relation to needing proof of sufficient funds.
"
Jɔni mako bɛ na jɔ kosɛbɛ wisa kuntalajan?,"Based on the provided text (P), the correct answer is:

**C: Kalenden dunan** (Foreign student)

The passage explicitly states that students who want to study for a longer period need to apply for a student visa, which has different requirements and processes than tourist or work visas.
"
"Waati juman, kɛrɛnkɛrɛnnenyala, i ka kan k’i janto sosow la?","The correct answer is **C: Kunkofin kɔnɔ** (In the trunk).

The passage specifically states that you need to be especially careful about scorpions in the trunk.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, i ka kan k’i janto mun na walasa k’i yɛrɛ kisi soso ma n’i bɛ mɔbili bolila kunkofin kɔnɔ?","The correct answer is **A: Ka mɔbili daw yɛlɛnnen to waati jan kɔnɔ**.

The passage states: ""...sekɔni dama damaniw nin mɔbili da yɛlɛli ye waatimina i be dɔn a kɔnɔ be seka to sosow be dɔn mɔbili kɔnɔ nin i ye.""

This translates to something like: ""...even brief openings of the car door are enough time for mosquitoes to get inside the car.""

Therefore, keeping the car doors open for a long time increases the risk of mosquitoes entering the car.  The other options are not mentioned in the text, and are therefore incorrect.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, nin kuma juman kelen tɛ tiɲɛ ye Sunbarbans kukan?","The correct answer is **D: A kɛra mankalanin nɔnma dagayɔrɔ ye ka tɛmɛ Bengal tigiri kan** (It has become a sanctuary for a population greater than that of the Bengal tiger).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Sundarbans is estimated to have 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 people living there. This means the human population *is* larger than the tiger population. Thus, D is an incorrect statement based on the provided text.
*   The passage supports the other statements:
    *   A: The passage mentions ""kunkoba laban tɔlenw"" (remaining large forests)
    *   B: The passage mentions that a significant portion of the area is covered by ""ji ani lɛkɔnɔnaw"" (water and swamps).
    *   C: The passage states ""Sunbarbans ye diɲɛ kɔkɔjidabolo ba ye"" (Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest)."
Kunko in fan juman bɛ Inde dugukolo kan?,"The correct answer is **A: Sundarbans dugu Pariki**.

The passage states: ""Kunko fan min be Inde dugukolo kɔnɔ ye min be wele Sundarbans Dugu Pariki."" This directly translates to ""The part of the forest that is in India is called Sundarbans National Park.""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, a dɔgɔyara cogo o cogo Angilɛ kan famuya dannen bɛ se ka sɔrɔ jɔn na?","The correct answer is **B: Demisɛnw**.

The passage states: ""...ali na sɔrɔ i be seka a dɔni dalen ye - kɛrɛnkɛrɛniyala denmisɛniw cɛla."" This translates to ""...and maybe you can understand it fully - especially among children."" This implies children are particularly capable of understanding English with a simplified accent.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsiran ye, mun fɔli ka gɛlɛn?","The correct answer is **B: Yɔrɔw (Places)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the world has been made especially difficult for ""yɔrɔ tɔw"" (other places) because their pronunciations are difficult at times.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni sɛbɛn nin ye, nin lahaliya juman kelen de bɛ se ka fisaya woyasikɛla ma min bɛ k’a ɲɛsigi ka bisi dɔ ta karitiyew ni ɲɔgɔncɛ bisiyɔrɔ la?","Based on the text provided, here's the breakdown and the best answer:

* **What we know from the text:**
    * Shared/pooled buses (karitiyew ɲɔgɔncɛ bisiw) operate during the day.
    * Many of these buses, especially those heading to eastern locations like Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
    * These shared buses have fluctuating schedules and advise booking tickets in advance.
    * They often use Japanese Coaster Buses that are reliable and affordable.
    * Taxis are a faster and more comfortable alternative for shorter trips, like to Paro (Nu 150 fare) or Punakha (Nu 200 fare).

* **Analyzing the options:**

    * **A: Woyasikɛla nin ɲɛsinnen bɛ Jakar ma w’a ye tike dɔ san ka bila:** This is a **good option**. The text specifically mentions Jakar/Bumthang buses leaving between 6:30 and 7:30, emphasizing the need to book in advance (""ka tike san tile dama damani kabila"").

    * **B: Woyasikɛla nin ɲɛsinnen bɛ Bumthang ma w’a ka kan ka bɔ sanga 7:** This is also a good option. bumthang buses leave around 7.

    * **C: Woyasikɛla nin ɲɛsinnen bɛ Paro ma wa ka kan ka bɔ sanga 11 tɛmɛnnen kɔfɛ:** The text doesn't mention any timing restrictions for Paro. Also, taxis are recommended for shorter trips like Paro, so waiting for a later bus isn't the best approach.

    * **D: Woyasikɛla in ɲɛsinnen bɛ Tilebinyafan ma w’a bɛ se bisiyɔrɔ la sani sanga 6:20 cɛ:** This is not a good strategy based on the text since Jakar/Bumthang buses leave between 6:30 and 7:30

* **The Best Answer:**

Options A and B are the best answers. They both are likely destinations and they should purchase tickets in advance, or aim to arrive around 7.
"
Mun bɛ se k’a kɛ bilasirali kan ɲuman ye turisi ma min bɛ fɛ ka bisi ta karitiye-ni-ɲɔgɔncɛ bisitayɔrɔ la ka woyase ka ta tilebin fɛ?,"The best answer is **B: Ka tike san tile damadamani ka bila**.

Here's why:

*   **The text specifically advises purchasing tickets in advance:** ""Komi karitiye ɲɔgɔncɛ bisiw faleno waatcamana, a ɲinineno ka tikɛ san tile dama damani kabila."" (Since charter buses often fill up quickly, it is recommended to purchase tickets several days in advance.)

Let's examine why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Bisiw tɛ ta ni 8:30 tɛmɛnnen tɛ**: The text states the buses leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM, not after 8:30 AM.
*   **C: Bisiw caman bɛ bɔ tile kɔnɔ**: While the text does mention that buses run daily, the crucial advice for a tourist is to secure a ticket beforehand.
*   **D: Takisi minnu bɛ tila olu bɛ se ka kɛ woyasi cogoya bɛɛ la ɲuman ye**: While taxis are mentioned as a convenient alternative, they might not be the most budget-friendly option, and the question asks for the *best* advice in the context of *taking a charter bus*.

Therefore, buying tickets in advance is the most relevant and useful advice for a tourist wanting to take a charter bus.
"
Nin fɛn juman kelen tɛ Tombouctou ɲɛfɔli hakika ye?,"The correct answer is **C: Pankuru tɛ ta yen**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Tombouctou *is* a ""fanta dugu"" (poor city), so B is incorrect.
*   The passage states that Tombouctou *does* still attract tourists and has an airport (ayeropɔri beyi), so D is incorrect.
*   The passage explicitly states that Tombouctou's Arab influence outweighs its African one, so A is incorrect.
*   The passage does not mention anything about ""Pankuru"", so C is the correct answer."
Nin wale juman kelen ye tiɲɛ ye Tombouctou kun kan?,"Let's analyze the given passage and the options:

*   **Passage:** The passage explicitly states ""Tombouctou ye fanta dugu ye, ali na sɔrɔ a tɔgɔ be turisiw sama, ani ayeropɔri beyi"" (Tombouctou is a fantastic city, but its name attracts tourists, and it has an airport). It also mentions that the city is unique due to ""Arabu cogoya kabɔn ka tɛmɛ a ka farafin ya kan"" (Arab influence is more than its African influence).

Now let's examine the options:

*   **A: Pankurun tɛ ta dugun in kɔnɔ:** The passage doesn't mention poverty in the city, so we can't infer anything from this.
*   **B: Dugu kɔrɔ don ka tɛmɛ fantan dugu ka:** The passage states ""Tombouctou nana nati inafɔ dugu janw ani fɔlɔfɔlɔ duguw wele tɔgɔ ye."" (""Tombouctou"" was called the name of many old and first cities""). The text also calls it a fantastic city. So, it's suggested that it is older than a fantastic city is considered.
*   **C: A ka farafinyan cogoya kadɔgɔn ka tɛmɛ a lamini duguw ta kan:**  The passage says ""Arabu cogoya kabɔn ka tɛmɛ a ka farafin ya kan"" (Arab influence is more than its African influence). This implies that the Arab influence is more prominent than its African influence. This is similar to ""A ka farafinyan cogoya kadɔgɔn ka tɛmɛ a lamini duguw ta kan."" (Its African influence is less than the surrounding cities). So this choice is a strong contender.
*   **D: Dugu in tɛ tusisiw sama tun:** The passage directly contradicts this, stating that the name of the city attracts tourists.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is **C** because it accurately reflects the statement in the passage about the greater influence of Arab culture compared to African influence. Also the city is also older than the city is fantastic.
So both B and C are potential answers. But C is more specific to the text provided.
Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{C}$"
Olympique tilemafɛ tun bolodara ka bɛn waati fɔlɔ juman ma? ,"The text states: ""inafɔ Marisi laban na, bɔli ama sariyaw ko sababu kɛ korona banakisɛ ye te sama ka ta fo Zuwekalo 2020, nin Olympique zuyew bolodara kura ye.""  This means that the new date for the Olympics was postponed until July 2020 (Zuwekalo 2020).

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Zuyekalo san 2020**.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, hakɛ jumɛn na fiyɛn antonurayi bɛ yɛlɛma ka kɛ fiyɛn kolɔn?","The correct answer is **D: Makalen kɔ dugumakolola** (After touching the ground).

The passage states: ""...be kɛ """"fiyɛn kolɔn"""" ye tumamina u be maka tugumakolola."" which directly translates to ""...it becomes a 'lightning strike' when it touches the ground.""
"
Ninnu jumɛn kelen ye kunnafoni tigitigi ye fiyɛn kolon kan?,"The correct answer is **D: Olu ye fiyɛn fitiniw ye minnu bɛ fiyɛn sama kata kɔfɛ** (They are small air currents that pull air towards the center and upwards).

Here's why:

*   The passage describes them as ""fiyɛn fitini munu munata ye, min be gɛrɛfɛyɔrɔ fiyɛn sama kado kɔnɔ ani kɔɔfɛ"" which directly translates to small air currents that pull air towards the center and upwards.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Tuma bɛɛ u bɛ fiyɛn wili ka surunya kilomɛtɛrɛ 100-200 lɛrila (They always move at speeds of approximately 100-200 kilometers per hour):** The passage says they *can* reach those speeds (""waatidɔw la kilomɛtiri 100-200 lɛrila"" - at times 100-200 kilometers per hour), not that they always do.
*   **B: U bɛ fɛn girinmaw cɛ u fɛ waatidɔw (They carry heavy objects with them at times):** The passage states that they *can* carry heavy objects, but this option is a bit too vague and doesn't fully encompass the process described.
*   **C: U bɛ yɛlɛma ka kɛ antonurayi ye tumamina u be maka tugumakolola (They transform into anticyclones when they encounter obstacles):** The passage states that they *become* ""fiyɛn kolɔn"" when they encounter obstacles and originate as an anticyclone sinking. ""fiyɛn kolɔn"" means ""dust devil"", not that they become an anticyclone. This is a misinterpretation.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate and direct summary of the dust devil's characteristics from the given passage."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, woyasi kɛla kan ka politigi ko cogoyaw kunnafoniw sɔrɔ yɔrɔ jumɛn u bɛna woyazi ka taa jamana min na?","The correct answer is **D: Kabɔ u yɛrɛ ka gɔfɛrɛneman yɔrɔ** (From their own government).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: *""I be seka kanu lala ka gɔfɛrɛnemanw ka ladilikanw lajɛ nin i yɛrɛ ta ye...""* which translates to *""It is advisable to review government advice as well as your own...""*. This implies consulting one's own government's advice.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: While researching the destination country is important, the passage emphasizes comparing that information with *your own* government's advice.
*   B: The passage says that short-term news reports are more reliable and easier to access than lots of detailed official information. However, the passage also suggests using one's own government's travel advice.
*   C: The passage focuses on the official advice given to citizens by their own governments, instead of asking citizens of the country the traveler is going to."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni woyazi ladilikanw hakilina ye, mun ni mun man teli ka jamana wɛrɛ mɔgɔ sɔrɔ?","The passage says: ""Ladilikanw ye dɔrɔn dakuruɲɛ dama damani ye jamana dɔ politi ko cogoya kan.

This translates to: ""Recommendations are only a limited view of a country's political situation. Facts that are seen in real-time are more important and easier to understand than detailed information available elsewhere.""

Therefore, the answer is **B: Dakuruɲɛ dama damani barakurubaw jamana in politi ko cogoya kan (A limited view of the current situation in the country's political affairs)**. Recommendations provide a limited understanding, while real-time observations are more important.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, woyasi suguya jumɛn kelen de ka dɔgɔ kosɛbɛ min tɛ taa woyasi ɲɛnɛbɔba baarakɛla ka dɛmɛ kɔ ka marali kɛ?","The passage states: ""Ali na sɔrɔ azansi camaw be fɛka yɔrɔmara nɔrɔmaliw kɛɛ, woyasi ɲɛnɛbɔba baarakɛla camaw b'u yɛrɛw sipesiyalize kɛrɛnkɛrɛniyala woyasi suguya dɔw kan, waaribɔta filancɛ walima lajɛɛkikɛyɔrɔ."" This implies that while many agencies handle normal travel arrangements, many travel agents specialize in certain types of travel like business or group trips. The passage does *not* imply that any type of travel is *less* likely to be handled by a travel agent. It only implies that some agents specialize. Therefore, none of the provided answer choices are explicitly supported by the text.

However, if we have to choose the *least likely*, it would be **A: Ɲɔgɔn ye baara hukumu kɔnɔ woyasi ka ta dugu la woyasi kɛla delila ka taa yɔrɔ min ka tɛmɛ**.

Here's why:

*   **A (Work-related travel to a familiar city)** is likely to be handled directly by the business or the individual, because it's a common and often straightforward type of trip. Employees or businesses often have systems in place for regular travel.
*   **B (Two-week long trip to a specific resort)** is more likely to be specialized, particularly because resorts may offer packages and agents will be knowledgable about these offers.
*   **C (A couple's honeymoon)** is also more likely to be specialized, because people seek guidance on important, once in a lifetime trips.
*   **D (Someone's first trip abroad)** can be intimidating so agents are more likely to be consulted for assistance and guidance.

Therefore, **A** is the most likely to be handled independently, making it the least likely to require a travel agent's assistance."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, sinariyo jumɛn kelen na woyazi kɛla bɛ nafan caman sɔrɔ ni woyasi ɲɛnɛbɔba baarakɛla ka dɛmɛ ye?","The correct answer is **B: Tuma min dugutaala bɛ fɛ ka kɛrɛnkɛrɛniyala woyasi suguya dɔ marali kɛ a siyɛn fɔlɔ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that while many agencies do general travel arrangements, ""voyage planning operators often specialize themselves in certain types of voyages, work boats freelance or assembly area.""
*   This suggests that someone looking for a very *specific* type of voyage will benefit most from using a specialized travel planner.

The other options are less directly supported by the text:

*   **A:** While managing logistics is part of what travel planners do, the passage doesn't specifically highlight domestic travel as a reason to *need* a travel planner.
*   **C:** Being comfortable speaking the local language is helpful, but doesn't inherently require professional assistance for planning.
*   **D:** Familiarity with local culture might make travel easier, but again, doesn't necessarily mean a travel planner is *required* for a better experience."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, fɛn jumɛn bɛ se ka woyasi kɛla dɛmɛ ka jigifabaliya bali tuma min a bɛ woyase ka taa dugu kuraw la?","The correct answer is **D: Ɲininiw so ko la yani ka se balili**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes understanding the new place *before* going.** It says ""Fɛnw camaw beyi i kan ka min jateminɛ yani and tumamina i be ka woyase ka ta yɔrɔ dɔ la"" which translates to ""Many things you must consider *before* you decide to travel to a place.""

* **The passage highlights potential differences.** It lists things like customs, laws, food, security, politics, hygiene, language, etc., as things that *won't* be the same as where you're from.

* **The passage explicitly mentions avoiding prejudice/dislike based on the differences.** ""O ye fɛn ye i kan ka min bila i kun na, ka jigifabaliya bali walima lala ali yɔrɔ ko kɛ cogow kanu baliya."" This means you should keep this in mind to avoid being prejudiced or disliking the way things are done in the new place.

Option D, ""Ɲininiw so ko la yani ka se balili"" (Researching the place *before* arriving), directly addresses the need to understand the new place before going, helping to avoid prejudice and cultural shock.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka sigi ni balocogo kelenw ye inafɔ u bɔyɔrɔ** (To live with the same hygiene habits as their place of origin) - The passage specifically says things won't be the same, so trying to maintain the same hygiene habits might not be appropriate or even possible. This also doesn't prevent prejudice.
* **B: Sɔnni ka dumuni nɛnɛ u tɛ minnu dɔn** (Accepting to taste foods that they don't know) - While being open to new experiences is good, this doesn't directly prevent prejudice or cultural shock.
* **C: K’u bɛrɛ bɛn sariya kelenw ma inafɔ u bɔyɔrɔ** (To strictly obey the same laws as their place of origin) - This is impossible, as the laws will be different. The passage emphasizes understanding *the new* laws.
"
"Ka sinsin kunnafoni ni tɛmɛ sira in ye,mɔgɔ suguya jumɛn de se a dɔla ka jigifabaliya sɔrɔ tuma min nin i ne woyazi ka taa kɔfɛ Jamana dɔ la?","Based on the passage (P), the best answer is **C: Mɔgɔ min hakili ka gɛlɛn (Someone who is open-minded).**

Here's why:

* **P emphasizes the importance of considering differences in culture, laws, customs, language, etc., when traveling.**  It warns against assuming things will be the same as ""home."" The passage advocates for avoiding rigidity or a lack of appreciation for other cultures.

* **""Hakili ka gɛlɛn"" (open-mindedness) is the quality most directly relevant to understanding and accepting cultural differences.** An open-minded person is more likely to be receptive to new experiences and less likely to be shocked or judgmental about unfamiliar customs.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Mɔgɔ min bɛ yɔrɔwɛrɛ dumuniw fɛ (Someone who likes different foods):** While an adventurous palate is a positive trait for travel, it doesn't encompass the broader cultural awareness that P stresses.

* **B: Mɔgɔ min yɛlɛma kadi (Someone who is easy to adapt):**  Adaptability is useful, but it's not the same as having the *mindset* that allows for understanding and accepting different cultural norms.

* **D: Mɔgɔ min bɛ kalan fɛ (Someone who likes to learn):** A desire to learn is helpful, but learning alone isn't enough. Open-mindedness is needed to apply that learning and appreciate the value of different cultures.

Therefore, **C (open-mindedness)** is the quality that most directly aligns with the passage's advice for avoiding ""jigifabaliya"" (shock or disappointment) when traveling.

Ninnu jumɛn kelen ma tɛ bilasirali kan ɲuman ye taama kɛlaw man tuma min na i be ka woyase ka ta yɔrɔ dɔ la u siyɛn fɔlɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: A ɲini i ka maara kunkokɔnɔna dɔn yani i k'i da duguman**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically advises against building tents or setting up camp in areas you don't know well. It emphasizes that understanding the local environment is crucial.
*   The other options contradict the advice given in the passage:
    *   **B:** The passage advises seeking out European-style food and hotels to aid in acclimatization, not to aggressively restrict your diet.
    *   **C:** The passage advises planning or building a camp so that one is able to ward off animals if staying outside.
    *   **D:** The passage does not reference the concept of paying tips to those who service them."
Ninnu jumɛn kelen ma fɔ inafɔ fɛn min kan ka gɛrɛfɛ kosɛbɛ n'i bɛ fɛ k'i dege jamana dewelopeni dɔ la?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Erɔpu dumunicogola**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kɛrɛnkɛrɛniyala i ka tile fɔlɔw la, a ɲinin ka gɛrɛfɛ kosɛbɛ Erɔpu balolicogola ani otɛli, dumuniw ani sɛriwisi ɲumanw k'i dɛmɛ degilila."" This translates to ""Especially in your first days, try to be as close as possible to European-style accommodation, hotels, food and good services to help you adjust."" This directly indicates a need to be close to European food styles when adjusting.
"
"Ninnu sira jumɛnw de kaɲi kosɛbɛ kɔntira tigi min bɛ fɛ ka viritiyali kopi dɔ mara, nka a bɛ se ka kɛ ɛntɛrinɛti t'a bolo?","The passage states: ""...sɛbɛn kopi dɔ mara memuwari kan walima disiki (min be sɔrɔ ali ni ɛntɛrɛnɛti tɛ)."" This directly translates to keeping a copy on a memory stick or disk that doesn't require internet access.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Ka kopi dɔ mara u ka ɔridinatɛri memuwari kan** (Keep a copy on their computer's memory stick).
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn mako tɛ se jirali la kɔntira sanfɛ?","The correct answer is **D: Kɔntira tigui ka imeyili**.

Here's why:

* The passage mentions needing to show ""asuransi ka imeyili"" (insurance email) and ""nɛgɛjuruw"" (financial records) through ""ladilikanw, jɛnw ani laɲiniw siratigɛ fɛ"" (recommendations, receipts, and requests). This covers options A, B, and C.
* The passage **doesn't** explicitly mention needing to show the contractor's (kɔntira tigui) email. It focuses on *your* insurance and *your* financial records.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, negatiwu janya jumɛn kelen de bɛ kɛ filimu fɔrima kodɔnlen ba la?","The correct answer is **B: 56 ni 56 milimɛtiri negatiwu**.

The passage states: ""Filimu fɔrima fitini kamera dɔw be 6 nin 6 cm fɔrima itilize, kɛrɛnkɛrɛniyala 56 nin 56 mm negatiwu.""  This directly identifies the size of the negative used in some early medium format cameras as 56 x 56 mm.
"
Ninnu filimu fɔrima jumɛnw bɛ solisiyɔn ka surun DSLR dɔ la?,"Based on the provided information, the correct answer is **C: 56 x 56 mm filimu** and **D: 6 x 6 cm filimu.**

Here's why:

*   The text states that a 56 x 56 mm negative provides a resolution equal to four times the area of a 35 mm negative. Since the 35 mm film resolution is comparable to a modern DSLR, the 56 x 56 mm film has considerably higher resolution, thus can be considered even closer to a DSLR. 6 x 6 cm is approximately the same as 56 x 56 mm.

*   The question asks which film format has a resolution *surpassing* the resolution of a DSLR. 35 mm film resolution is roughly equivalent to a modern DSLR."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ninnu jumɛn kelen bɛ se ka kɛ a dɔ la sen laban ye ni bɛka woyasi sɛbɛni baaraw daminɛ?","The correct answer is **C: I yɛrɛ tɔgɔla ɛntɛrinɛti siti dilan**.

Here's why:

* **P: Sira nɔgɔmani ba ka woyasi sɛbɛni baaraw daminɛ ye k'i ka dɔniya taɲɛ ɛntɛrɛnɛti sanfɛ woyasi bulɔgi siti jɔlen dɔ kan.

After you practice writing styles and your writing skills online, after that, you will be able to create your own website.
* The passage clearly states that *after* learning and practicing on an existing platform, the final step is to create your own website.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Toka sɛbɛni sɛbɛn kɛcogoya taa ni ka segin:** (Continue to learn and repeat writing styles) This is part of the learning *process*, not the final step.
* **B: Artikiliw badenba sɛbɛn taama bulɔgi lakodonnen ba dɔ ye:** (Writing a good number of articles for an existing blog) This is how you gain experience *before* creating your own site.
* **D: K'i ka sɛbɛnin kɛliw dɔnniya taɲɛ:** (Improve your writing skills/knowledge) This is also part of the learning *process*.

Therefore, **C** is the only option that represents the final step as described in the passage."
"Waati min i bɛ woyasi sɛbɛni baaraw kɛ, ninnu se jumɛnw kelen de fɔlɔ fɔlɔ kaɲi ka ladilan halibi?","The correct answer is **A: Bulɔgi baaraw**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sira nɔgɔmani ba ka woyasi sɛbɛni baaraw daminɛ ye k'i ka dɔniya taɲɛ ɛntɛrɛnɛti sanfɛ woyasi bulɔgi siti jɔlen dɔ kan."" This translates to: ""The easiest way to start voyage writing is to gain experience on an existing voyage blog site online.""  This means learning how a blog works is the first step.

The passage then goes on to say you learn writing styles, then you can create your own site. Therefore, understanding blog operations is the initial step.
"
Yɔrɔ jumɛn kelen na kɔnɔna kunbalanw ka c'a la ka sɔrɔ ?,"The correct answer is **C: Yɔrɔ kalanmaw (Hot climates)**.

The passage states ""kɔnɔna kunbalanw yɔrɔ kalamaw la ka ca"" which translates to ""diarrheal illnesses are more common in hot climates.""
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, waati bɛɛ bilali bɛ se k’i lakana kabɔ fɛn jumɛn bana ma?","Let's break down the passage and the question:

The passage states:

*   ""So, ko sababu kɛ waatibɛɛ bilali ye maarayɔrɔ banakisɛ la, a ka c'ala i lakana neno kabɔ nin bana ninunw ma."" This means that constant handwashing with soap can protect you from infections caused by bacteria.

The question asks:

*   ""Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, waati bɛɛ bilali bɛ se k’i lakana kabɔ fɛn jumɛn bana ma?"" Based on the passage, what type of illness can constant handwashing protect you from?

Based on this, the answer is **B: Maarayɔrɔ banakisɛw** (Infections caused by bacteria).
"
Ninnu jumɛn ye nafa dɔ ye n’'i bɛ woyazi Schengen maara kɔnɔ?,"The correct answer is **D: Furɔntiyɛriw tikɛli hali i ma tɛmɛ pasipɔri lajɛ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""K'i to maara in kɔnɔ, i be seka **furɔntiyɛriw tikɛ hali i ma tɛmɛ pasipɔri lajɛli yɔrɔw fɛ tugun**."" This directly indicates that being within the Schengen area allows you to cross borders without passport checks.
*   The Passage also states: ""O cogo kelen na, nin Schengen wiza b'i bolo, i mako tɛ ka wiza ɲinin ka ta Schengen jamana dɔla tuguni, ola o ye **waati mara ye, waari ani sɛbɛnkɔw baaraw.**"" So **A, B and C** are correct but the most correct answer is **D**."
Fɛn jumɛn tɛ sɔrɔ bilen Ttankhamun kaburu la?,"The correct answer is **D: Fɛnmaw (Gold Artifacts)**.

The passage states: ""Kaburu warimanfɛnw ɲuman nininw t'a kɔnɔ tuguni, nka a tara ka ta Egyptie mize kɔnɔ Caire."" This translates to ""The beautiful gold artifacts are no longer inside, but found and taken to the Egyptian museum in Cairo."" The other options, mumi kunkolo (mummy skull) and mumi kamanw (mummy limbs), are still present in the tomb, while labɛnni dɔ is a general term that doesn't definitively exclude its presence.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ nin tɛmɛsira ye, Vancouver yɔrɔ jumɛn tɛ taamaden tɛgɛmagɛlɛnw saman hali dɔɔnin? ","Let's analyze the passage and the options:

*   The passage mentions **Bowen Island** as a ferry ride from Vancouver. It notes the various things to do there.
*   The passage mentions the **Sea and Sky Gondola** as an attraction.
*   The passage mentions **Whistler**, which is a bit further away from Vancouver.
*   **Granville Island** is mentioned as the departure point for the ferry to Bowen Island.

The question asks which of the Vancouver areas is not described as attractive to tourists. Since Granville Island is simply mentioned as a departure point, it is the least tempting choice.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Granville Island**."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni sɛbɛn nin ye, taayɔrɔ jumɛn bɛ sɔn kosɔbɛ ka taamadenw labɔ Vancouver sigi yɛrɛyɛrɛ kalama?","The correct answer is **A: Bowen Gun**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Bowen Gun ye tile woyazi kodɔnlen ye walima dɔkɔkun boli min kayaki, kululayɛlɛ, butukiw, dumuni kɛyɔrɔw ani fɛn camaw bil'aw ka bolo kan."" This translates to ""Bowen Gun is a well-known day trip or weekend getaway where you can find kayaking, hiking, boutiques, restaurants, and much more."" Therefore, it is the destination most likely to draw visitors away from Vancouver.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, waati jumɛnna taamadenw ka kan ka taa bɔ jijigin na n’u bɛ filɛkɛnɛjɛ ɲininna?","The correct answer is **D: Samiya bɔ kɔ** (After the summer).

Here's why:

* The passage says during the rainy season (November to March), the water level is high and makes it difficult to see the falls.
* Therefore, the best time to visit for clear views would be after the rainy season (Samiya bɔ kɔ).
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni sɛbɛn nin ye, mun de ye Victoria Falls bɔnnali koɲuman ye Nowanburu nin Marisi cɛ?","The correct answer is **C: Jijigin kabako yeli (The sight of the falls is obscured)**.

The text states: ""Samiya waatil kɔnɔ (Nowanburukalo ka Marisikalo), ji bɔnɲa be yɛlɛ ani jibɔnyɔrɔ bena cɛn kojuguya. Sira wɛrɛ fɛ, o de kama tiki tiki bari ji bɔnɲa yɛlɛneno kosɛbɛ ko ji bɔnw yɔrɔ lajɛli be dibi - nin jiw bɛɛ ye.""

This translates to: ""During the rainy season (November to March), the water flow increases and the falls become very clouded. This is because the water volume is so high that the view of the falls is obscured - by all the water.""

Therefore, the main downside of visiting Victoria Falls between November and March is that the view of the falls is obstructed. This corresponds to option C.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jumɛn tɛ kanunnen doroni kɛtɔla ka ja ta?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**D: Ka ja ta jamama yɔrɔw dɔrɔn la nin doroni tɛ na sɛn ka jateminɛ** (Only take pictures in public places where the drone isn't seen or noticeable).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that drone usage near airports or sensitive areas (like government buildings) is not appropriate and that users should respect privacy. Option D aligns with the idea of being discreet and avoiding sensitive areas.

The other options aren't explicitly mentioned in the passage as things you *should* do:

*   **A: Ka lajɛ fɔlɔ i bɛ sɛn ka min ja ta** (First consider what you are going to take pictures of): While understanding what you're filming is important, the passage doesn't frame this as a primary concern.
*   **B: Ka yamaruyalisɛbɛn farankan sɔrɔ** (Obtain authorization form): Obtaining permission is not specifically addressed in the passage.
*   **C: Ɲininnin yamaruyalisɛbɛn** (Investigate authorization form): obtaining information on permissions is not specifically addressed in the passage."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, ja ta yɔrɔ ɲumanbaw bɛ min doroni la?","The passage states that ""Drone use near airports or government buildings is not a smart idea, nor is filming private property."" This implies restrictions on where drones can be used.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Kɛrɛfɛ jamaw minnu tɛ tɔɔrɔ nin doroni nali ye (Remote communities that do not restrict drone use):** This aligns with the idea of avoiding restricted areas.

*   **B: Yɔrɔw la ladala nin nataliye tɛ yamaruyalen (Undeveloped natural areas):** While seemingly safe, this doesn't directly address the restrictions mentioned in the passage. A drone could still be banned in a national park, for example.

*   **C: Yɔrɔ falenw na nin doroni yeli ka dɔgɔn (crowded place where drone use is low):** The passage directly states not to film private property, therefore filming in crowded places is wrong.

*   **D: Yɔrɔw la i ye yamaruyalisɛbɛnw sɔrɔ minnuw kunkɔrɔ ka kɔn (Places where you have obtained prior written permission):** This is the most accurate answer. It directly addresses the need to follow rules and regulations before flying a drone in a particular location. Getting permission ensures you're not violating any restrictions.

Therefore, the best answer is **D**."
"Ka sinsin nin tɛmɛ sira ye, mankutu jumɛn jamana doninsɛbɛn tɔgɔsɛbɛn ɲɛnabɔli kunkan tɛ tiɲɛ ye?","Let's analyze the text and the options to determine the correct answer.

The passage states the following about registration requirements:

*   It's a process to get a visa.
*   Some countries require passport copies, addresses, etc.
*   Sometimes registration forms are needed for police/immigration.
*   Many countries require hotels to keep registration records.
*   In *some* cases, only people staying in tourist accommodations have to register.
*   The specifics are determined by local laws.

Now let's evaluate the options:

*   **A: Ni bɛna to turisi jiginsow la, A bɛ sɛn ka kɛ i mako tɛ k’i tɔgɔ sɛbɛn (If you are staying at tourist accommodation, it is necessary, you do not need to register.)** - This is the *opposite* of what the passage says. The passage says that *sometimes* registration is only required for tourist accommodations. So, this is incorrect.

*   **B: A ɲininnendow jamana bɛɛ denw fɛ k’u tɔgɔsɛbɛn sigida sariyasow la (It is required of all citizens of the country to register with local authorities.)** - The passage doesn't state that. The passage focuses on visas and tourism, not domestic registration.

*   **C: Taamadenw ka cakɛda taali bɛ sɔn ka ɲinin i kan (Traveling trade companies are allowed to inquire about you.)** - The text makes no direct mention about travelling trade companies. Therefore it is an incorrect statement.

*   **D: Yɔrɔdɔw la, sigida dunanjiginsow bɛ sɛn k’i jɔ nin tɔgɔsɛbɛn ye (In some places, local tourists need to register.)** The passage implies that in some cases, registration is only for people using tourist accommodation. Therefore it can be inferred that this statement is false.

However, by looking at the instructions, ""which statement is NOT true"", the only option that is incorrect, and therefore is the answer, is **A.**"
Jumɛn tɛ yɔrɔ ye nin turisi bɛ sɛn ka taa ka tɔgɔsɛbɛn ɲɛnabɔ?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **B: Dunanjiginso min n’u bɛ ka to ye (Dunanjiginso min n’u bɛ ka to ye)**.

The passage mentions that registration is sometimes only required for people staying at tourist accommodations. Dunanjiginso min n’u bɛ ka to ye means tourist accommodations. The other options are not specifically mentioned in the passage as places where tourists would need to register.
"
Wɔlɔntɛriya tɛ jɔn nafa ka to taama la?,"Based on the passage (P), the best answer is:

**C: Mɔgɔ jigidalen bɛ ka dɔnko kura sɔrɔ (A person hoping to acquire new knowledge)**

Here's why:

* **Passage P emphasizes the benefits of traveling and volunteering as ways to learn new things, meet new people, understand different perspectives, and gain new skills.** It highlights personal growth and broadening one's horizons.
* Option C aligns directly with this theme of acquiring new knowledge and experiences.
* Options A, B and D are possible but do not directly align to the main point of the passage.

Therefore, **C** is the most logical and fitting answer.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, cogo jumɛn na wɔlɔntɛriya bɛ sɛn ka kɛ nafabɔfɛn ye taamaden bolodɛsɛnnɛnw ma k’u to kɔkan?","Based on the passage, the best answer is **D: A bɛ sɛn k’i dɛmɛ ka hakilinata sɔrɔ (It can help you gain experience/insights).**

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that volunteering and studying abroad are good ways to learn about different cultures, meet new people, understand different perspectives, and gain new skills. All of these contribute to gaining insights and experience.

Here's why the other options are not as good:

*   **A: Sara bɛ ɲinin ka sɔrɔ waati bɛ (Salary is sought to earn time is)** - The passage mentions that many volunteer opportunities cover accommodation and food, implying that while salary may not be the primary focus, the reduced expenses are a benefit. It doesn't directly link volunteering to earning time.
*   **B: A bɛ na nin baara sɔrɔ sira ye (It comes with this job opportunity)** - While volunteering can *sometimes* lead to job opportunities, the passage doesn't present it as the main benefit or purpose.
*   **C: So nin jiriw bɛ di fu waati dɔw la (The house and trees are given sometimes free)** - The passage mentions free accommodation as a potential benefit, but this is not the most essential thing as being a volunteer.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate reflection of the main ideas presented in the passage."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun bɛ sɛn ka jati tana ye taama camanna ka taa Walt Disney World la?","The correct answer is **D: ka kari ta ka bɔ pankurun jiginso la ka taa dunanjiginso la**

Here's why:

The passage states, ""tikew tɛ seka yɛlɛma"" which translates to ""tickets cannot be transferred"". If you buy a ticket for a specific park and date, you can't just change it to another park or date. This means you could be stuck with a ticket you can't use if you change your plans."
Mankutu jumɛn Walt Disney World kunkan n’a tɛ tiɲɛ ye?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**D: Kile camanta tikɛtiw bɛ sɛn ka sɔrɔ sannifeere bɔlɔlɔsiraw kan**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Tike camaw be fere ɛntɛrɛnɛti sanfɛ ferelikɛsitiw kan inafɔ eBay walima Craigslist..."" which translates to ""Many tickets are sold on internet marketplaces like eBay or Craigslist..."" This confirms that people DO try to sell tickets on these platforms.

The passage also mentions that Disney does not allow the resale of tickets. That is:
*   ""Ali ni o ye baara kodɔnlen ba dɔ ye, a kɔn neno Disney fɛ: tikew tɛ seka yɛlɛma.""
Which translates to ""Even if it is a common thing, Disney doesn't want it: tickets cannot be transferred.""
This means that even though they are resold, this is untrue according to Disney policy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Park-hopper tikɛtiw bɛ sɛn ka di taamaden wɛrɛw ma:** (Park-hopper tickets can be sold to other travelers.) The passage does not mention park-hopper tickets. It simply says, ""tickets"" in general.
*   **B: Yɔrɔ dunanjiginso yɛrɛ bilalen b’a kɔnɔ** (The site itself is desolate) This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Kariw bilalen bɛ ye ka taamadenw ta ka bɔ pankurun jiginso la ka taa u ka sow la** (Cars are used to pick up travelers from the park to their homes). While transportation *is* mentioned (bisi ta ka o yɔrɔ Disney ɔtɛli - taking a bus to the Disney hotel), there's nothing about cars taking people *home*.

"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kunkow jumɛn ka tɛli n’a bɛɛ ye ko makama k’a la baaradegin kalansow kɔnɔ ani kunnafonigafew kan?","Based on the passage, the most relevant and immediate skills to be learned in the described training and information materials are:

*   **B: Furakɛlilan fɔlɔw labɛn (First aid preparation):** The text explicitly mentions ""furakɛli dɛmɛli fɔlɔw camaw"" (many first aid assistance), indicating its importance in the training.
*   **C: Kɛlɛ yɔrɔ labɛn (War Zone Preparation):** The overall context is preparation for operation in a dangerous environment.

While other answers might be helpful, first aid in dangerous situations and war zone preparation is going to save lives in the context of the passage,
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, kalansen jumɛnw ka tɛli ka ta baaradegin kalansow kɔnɔ?","The passage mentions ""furakɛli dɛmɛli fɔlɔw camaw ani waatidɔw la marifa kalanw"" (many first aid treatments and occasional weapons training) as part of the 2-5 day training program. It also suggests the training is for situations considered almost war zones.

Considering the training's focus on first aid and the likely environment, **A: Furakɛlilan fɔlɔw (First aid)** is the most likely answer. While ""marifa kalanw (weapons training)"" is mentioned, the ""furakɛli dɛmɛli fɔlɔw (first aid treatments)"" is mentioned in a more emphatic sense (using the word ""camaw"" which means ""many""), implying a greater emphasis on first aid within the training.

Therefore, the answer is **A**.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, cogo jumɛn de kayin n’a bɛɛ ye yasa ka jicɛnta kɔsagon?","The passage states that some water filtration systems require boiling water for a minute, while others require several minutes. It also implies that water quality varies depending on the source. Therefore, the best way to ensure safe water is to boil it. Option A, ""Boil water for many hours,"" is not practical or necessary. Option C, ""Boil water for one hour,"" is also excessive. Option B, ""Filter Water,"" while a good idea, doesn't guarantee that the water is safe to drink. Option D, ""Collect water from the mineral springs"" does not guarantee a safe final product. The passage suggests that boiling is used to purify the water. Since some filtration systems require boiling water for some time, boiling is a useful part of making safe water. I am not certain about this passage, but the closest answer seems to be C, since the passage mentions needing to boil for a minute or more.

However, based on the prompt alone, without the context of the passage, **B: Jiforogo san** (Filter Water) would be the most reasonable answer.

Given the limitations and potential mistranslation, I will select **C: Ji wili Sanga kelen kɔnɔ (Boil water for one hour)** as the closest answer based on the prompt. But I am not completely confident in this answer.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, mun bɛ ye sɔɔni nin kɛɲɛnko dow hali nɔnkɛla ŋanaw fɛ?","The correct answer is **D: Ka nɔn jikuruw kɛrɛfɛ**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses how *some* springs are different than normal springs, and how the usual methods of draining them won't work on these kinds of springs.

The passage refers to springs that:
*   Emerge from the base of hills or mountains
*   Arise from small areas
*   Have water flowing to them underground.

Answer D refers to the general principle that some water springs are beside water mountains, just like it is referenced in the passage.
"
I ka Kan ka mun kɛ nin minɛna woyo fɛ?,"Based on the information provided in P (which describes the dangers of getting stuck in quicksand-like conditions), the best course of action is **A: A ɲinin k’i bɔ woyo kɔnɔ nin kilenni ye fan wɛrɛ fɛ, kɔfɛ k’i nɔn ka sɛgin dawolo la a cogo la** (Try to get out of the pit by moving little by little to the side, then lean back gently).

Here's why:

* **P emphasizes the danger of struggling against the force:** Trying to pull straight up (like in B) or forcing downwards (like in D) makes the situation worse.
* **P recommends a gradual and cautious approach:** This aligns with option A's suggestion to move ""little by little to the side"" and ""lean back gently.""
* **C is vague and unhelpful.**

Therefore, A is the most logical and safe option based on the provided text.
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, yɔrɔ jumɛn de faamadaga bɔnnali bɛ sɛn ka sɛgɛnfiyɛnlabɔ sennayaala kun bɔ?","The correct answer is **D: Jamana kɔnɔna jisira wo jisira dala**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that ""Dugukɔnɔ jisiraw be seka kɛ dankun ɲuman ka konze sinsin o kan."" which translates to ""Inland waterways are suitable for establishing good conditions for wine production.""
* Then it provides examples like the Loire Valley, Rhine Valley, and Danube, *followed by* the Erie Canal. This implies the Danube and Loire are considered inland waterways that facilitate wine production.
* However, the examples show that there are multiple rivers and waterways which could be used to facilitate the production of wine.

Therefore, the most general and encompassing answer is **D: Jamana kɔnɔna jisira wo jisira dala** (Inland waterways or rivers).
"
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, jumɛn tɛ sɛn ka kɛ ladilikan kanunen ye musow taama tɔ yɔrɔ in na?","The correct answer is **A: I yɛrɛ minɛ furukow ɲɛfɔli ma** (Restrain yourself from defining partners).

Here's why:

* **The passage advises against restricting oneself based on marital status.** The passage encourages women to assert themselves and not be afraid to take a stand, regardless of marital status (""I yɛr ja cɛw ɲɔntili ye, ani kana siran ka jɔ i jɔyɔrɔla (tabalo kelenyabaliya walima u tɛ, o t'a kɛ fɛn daganlen ye).""). Therefore, defining partners based on marital status is the opposite of the advice given.
* **The other options are aligned with the text's concerns**:
    * The passage focuses on difficult situations (B) and being resilient in those situations (C).
    * The passage indirectly encourages women to act decisively (D) and protect their intimate body parts in a way that is correct.

Therefore, the only option that contradicts the spirit and specific advice of the passage is A.
"
"Ka sinsin yɔrɔ kofɔlen kan tɛmɛ sira kɔnɔ, ladilikan min bɛ sɛn ka dɛmɛnni kɛ muso taamadenw ma?","Based on the passage, the best advice for women travelers to address potential harassment is:

* **A: Ka lakodɔn k’a manca labatola (To recognize that it is not your fault).**

The passage emphasizes that lack of respect (or ""table manners"") is not the fault of the woman.  This aligns directly with the provided text's emphasis on a woman's right to stand her ground and not be intimidated.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Ka bololanɛgɛ kunbaba don k’i ka furu koɲɛ jira (To wear a wedding ring to show you are married):** The passage speaks explicitly about how a woman who is married or not should be equally respected and standing her ground is not about the person she is married to.

*   **C: A dɔn ko danbew cɛ danfaraw b’a jira k’i ka kan ka (Recognize the differences in cultures to act accordingly).** While cultural awareness can be helpful, the passage implies that women should not need to change or conform themselves according to cultural values.

*   **D: Nin kungoɲɛfɔliw m’i diya, sabati i ban ninna cɛw la (Don't let the forest affect you, and go with the men).** This is the least appropriate. The passage advocates for women not to have to rely on what men have to say or offer.

*   The passage explicitly states ""sariya be parikiw kɔnɔ waatidɔw la ka ɲɛsin fototama fereli siratigɛw fɛ."" (There are sometimes laws within parks regarding photography methods). This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Nin u bɛ dantan fitiniw fotota a dan ma**: While the passage mentions the need for macro lenses for small details, this isn't the primary scenario where consent is needed.
*   **B: Nin forow bɛna ɲɛsin fereli siratigɛw fɛ**: While the passage mentions laws regarding photography methods. It means regulations in the park.
*   **C: Nin kunkokɔnɔ bagan min foro bɛka ta min bɛ maloya**: Although the passage indicates animals can be shy, this is not a reason why the photographer needs consent.

Therefore, option D is the most directly supported by the information in the passage."
Ninnu na jumɛn kelen ma fɔ tɛmɛ sira in kɔnɔ inafɔ gɛlɛya dulonnen kunkokɔnɔna fototala ma?,"The correct answer is **C: Kungolo suguya min makob'ala donni**.

Here's why:

*   **P (The passage):** The passage discusses several difficulties of wildlife photography:
    *   Difficulty of getting clear shots
    *   Need for expertise and patience
    *   Finding unique/remote locations
    *   Dealing with shy/easily scared animals
    *   Environmental conditions like heat and cold
*   **Q (The question):** Which of the following *is not* mentioned as a challenge for wildlife photographers?

Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: Kunkokɔnɔ baganw dɔw sɔrɔli (Finding some wild animals):** This IS mentioned in the passage as a difficulty.
*   **B: I mana bɛn bagan farinmanw ma (Encountering dangerous animals):** The passage mentions that some wild animals get *shy or scared*. Dangerous animals are not explicitly stated.
*   **C: Kungolo suguya min makob'ala donni (Knowing which species are necessary):** This is NOT mentioned in the text, so this is the correct answer.
*   **D: Baarakɛli yɔrɔ gɛlɛnman na (Working in difficult environments):** This IS mentioned as the passage cites environmental conditions, such as temperature, which can pose a challenge."
Ninnu na jumɛn bɛ se ka dɔgɔya kɔsɛbɛ ka kunbalanw lase mobilibolila ma kulu saɲfɛlara?,"The correct answer is **D: Yeli dɔgɔyali (Decreased visibility)**

Here's why:

* **The text directly states ""Yeli be seka dɔgɔya nin ɲɛsi benin walima carili ye"" which means ""Visibility can be reduced by rain or snow"".**  Reduced visibility is a major factor in accidents, especially on mountain roads.

Let's look at why the others are less likely:

* **A: Bolisira min tɛ jɔ (Laws not being enforced)** While the passage mentions traffic laws not being enforced during bad weather, that's a general point, not the primary cause of accidents in those conditions. It *contributes* but isn't the biggest reducer.
* **B: Minɛɲɔgɔnya dɔgɔyali (Reduced traction)** Reduced traction from ice and snow is definitely a problem, but the question specifically asks about *causes* of car accidents. Reduced traction *leads* to accidents, but reduced visibility is often the trigger.
* **C: Carili dantɛmɛ (Limited Traction):** Carili's translation appears to be the same as B.

Therefore, reduced visibility directly leads to a higher risk of accidents by making it harder to see the road, other cars, and potential hazards.
"
Fɛn jumɛn kelen de ka teli ka to ye takisi sarali ko la jamana caman kɔnɔ?,"The correct answer is **B: Cogoya**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Sɔrɔ takisi dilaneno cogoyacamaw la jamana camaw la"" which translates to ""Income tax structures vary widely across countries."" This directly addresses how the *structure* of income tax differs.
*   While tax rates (waariw) and deductions (bɔndaw) are mentioned as variables, the core idea is the varying structure (cogoya) of the tax system itself. Where you pay (I b'a sara yɔrɔ min) is dependent on structure, not the consistent core component."
"Ka kɛɲɛ ni tɛmɛsira in ye, nin i bɛ baara kɛ jamana kɔkɔjikɔfɛ jamanaw la n'ka i sigilen do yɔrɔ wɛrɛ, a ka can a la i bena i ka sɔrɔ takisi sara yɔrɔ jumɛn?","The correct answer is **A: Yɔrɔ o yɔrɔ n'i sigilendo ka kɔrɔ** (Wherever your primary residence is).

The passage states that income tax is often based on residency, and that you are obligated to pay taxes in the country where you are a resident.  Therefore, regardless of where you are working, your primary residence dictates where you pay income taxes.
"
Ninnu laseliw jumɛn tɛ Diɲɛ Sugu bugunnatigɛ tigitigi?,"Let's analyze each option based on the text provided.

*   **A: Tulɔnkɛw bɛ se jamana dɔ ka tariku walima balo cogoyaw jira yɛlɛmali so kɔnɔ** - The passage states ""Jamana minunw bo sendo ala be catiri ani kalan tulɔnkɛw jira yɛlɛmali so kɔnɔ ka diɲɛ kunbalanw jira walima u ka dugu tabolo ani tariku."" This statement directly confirms that option A is true according to the text.

*   **B: Filɛriw jiraliw bɛ jira yɛlɛmali so kɔnɔ ariw ani dɔniyaw jiraliw kɛrɛfɛ** - The passage mentions ""International Horticultural Expositions ye baara kɛrɛnkɛrɛni ye min filɛriw jira, filɛri zaridenw ani fɛnw fɛn nin o be taga nin jiriw ye."" This implies that the floral exhibitions are a specific type of event, but the text does not say whether it is done separately or alongside the arts and technology fairs, and whether it is done ""yɛlɛmali so kɔnɔ"".

*   **C: Baara ninunw be se ka kɛ fo katase kalo wɔrɔ kɔnɔ** - The passage indicates ""Nin baara ninunw be kɛ nɔrɔmalila kalo saba ani wɔɔrɔ nin ɲɔgɔncɛ,"" which translates to ""These events normally last between three and six months."" Therefore, this statement accurately reflects the text, meaning option C is true.

*   **D: A ɲinni ne tɛ Jamanaw k'u sen do a la** - The first sentence says ""Diɲɛ Sugu dɔ (kodɔnlen inafɔ World Eɲposition walima Expo dɔrɔn) ye diɲɛ ariw ani dɔniyaw ka fɛti ye. Jamana minunw bo sendo ala be catiri ani kalan tulɔnkɛw jira yɛlɛmali so kɔnɔ ka diɲɛ kunbalanw jira walima u ka dugu tabolo ani tariku."" This translates to ""A World's Fair (also known as a World Exposition or Expo) is a global festival of arts and technology. Countries participate and showcase their latest inventions and educational games to demonstrate world achievements or their culture and history."" Clearly, the passage describes it as a event **involving participation of countries**. Therefore, option D contradicts the text.

**Conclusion:**

Option D (""A ɲinni ne tɛ Jamanaw k'u sen do a la"") is the statement that is **not** accurately described as a feature of a World's Fair, because the text implies it needs the participation of countries.

**Final Answer: D**"
Ninnu jumɛn kelen ye Diɲɛ Sugu wali International Exposition sariya dɔ ye?,"The correct answer is **A: Jiraliw kan ka fɛn fila de jira yɛlɛmali so kɔnɔ diɲɛ kunbalanw jira walima u ka dugu tabolo ani tariku.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Jamana minunw bo sendo ala be catiri ani kalan tulɔnkɛw jira yɛlɛmali so kɔnɔ ka diɲɛ kunbalanw jira walima u ka dugu tabolo ani tariku."" This directly translates to countries presenting their cultures and educational entertainment by showcasing global challenges or their country's geography and history in exhibition halls.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jamana kelen in tɛ se k’'a baaraw kɛ san o san ka tugu ɲɔgɔna:** The passage does not state that one country cannot host consecutive expositions.
*   **C: Baaraw kan ka kɛ kalo wɔrɔ kɔnɔ:** The passage states that the events ""be kɛ nɔrɔmalila kalo saba ani wɔɔrɔ nin ɲɔgɔncɛ"" which means they last between three and six months, not exactly six months.
*   **D: Walasa ka sugu in sigi, jamana bɛɛ kan ka sen do a la:** The passage does not state that all countries have to participate in order for the expo to be set up. It simply says that countries choose to participate."
Ninnu jumɛn kɛli bɛ se ka dɔ bɔ bagan dɔ binkani farati la?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka mɛtɛrɛ 25 do a ni luw cɛ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage clearly states that park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of 100 meters from large animals like hippos and elephants and 25 meters from all other animals. Maintaining distance reduces the risk of being attacked.
*   So, option C directly reflects the recommendation from the passage and aims at reducing danger."
Ninnu jumɛn kelen ma fɔ ni tɛmɛ sira in kɔnɔ inafɔ kun dɔ min bɛ se ka na ni kunkonɔnfɛn ka binkaniw ye?,"Let's analyze the text and the options:

The text describes the dangers of approaching wild animals in the park. It mentions that animals can attack due to various reasons: protecting their young, hunting, or simply defending their territory. The text specifically warns about getting too close and mentions specific animals like hippos and crocodiles.

Now let's look at the options:

*   **A: Suma gɛlɛnw (Difficult temperatures)**: The text doesn't talk about the weather influencing attacks.
*   **B: Dɛsɛ ka yɔrɔ jan do aw cɛ (Lack of distance between you and them)**: The text emphasizes maintaining distance from the animals as a safety measure, directly connecting proximity to danger.
*   **C: Dumuni dili kunkɔnɔfɛnw ma (Food prepared for the animals)**:  The text mentions preparing or carrying a lot of food, which could attract animals, leading to a confrontation.
*   **D: Bagan minnu ma deli mɔgɔw la (Animals that are not used to people)**: While wild animals are generally not used to people, the main point of the text is the *distance* and *actions that might provoke* these animals (like carrying food).

Therefore, both B and C are relevant. However, B more directly addresses a cause of attacks mentioned in the text.

**The best answer is B and C**."
