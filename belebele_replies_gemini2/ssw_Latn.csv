"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lebeyingeke itsatfwe njenge thiphu lekungiyo yekudlala ngemphumelelo inkositini?","The correct answer is **A: Kute utfole ivolomu lengetiwe, khulisa emandla loshaya ngawo sikhiya**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that you *shouldn't* press the keys harder to increase the volume on an accordion (which is what ""inkositini"" refers to in this context).
*   The other options all reflect advice given in the passage: maintaining a relaxed hand (C), conserving energy (B), and using bellows pressure and speed to control volume (D)."
"Uma udlala inkositini, ngukuphi lokutawusita kukhulisa Ivolomu?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Sivinini lesingetiwe**

The passage explicitly states: ""...kutfola umsindvo lowengetiwe, usebentisa tifutfo leticindzetela kakhulu **noma letinesivinini lesikhulu.**"" (to get more volume, use stronger puffs **or higher speed**.)
"
Kungani titfombe letikumabonakudze tijube imincele yato?,"The passage states: ""Loku kwentiwa kuze kucinisekiswe kutsi lesitfombe simbonye sonkhe sikrini."" This translates to: ""This is done to ensure that the image fills the entire screen.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Ngako sitfombe sigcwalisa sikilini sonkhe** (So the image fills the entire screen).
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngutiphi tinkinga kuleti letilandzelako umuntfu langahle ahlangabetane nato uma agucula ibhayisikobho ibe ifomethi ye-DVD?","The correct answer is **B: Imibhalo lephasi isikwe kancane**.

The passage explicitly states that when converting a film to DVD, ""uma ngabe lelifilimu linemagama lachazako ladvute nangaphansi kwayo, ngeke avele kahle onkhe"" (if the film has subtitles near the bottom, they might not all show up). This means the subtitles, which are at the bottom, could be partially cut off. The passage also explains that the borders may be cut off and not show on the screen.
"
Belikuphi libutfo lemasotja aseBhrithani?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is:

**C: Bordentown**

The text states that General John Cadwalder will launch an attack on the British in Bordentown.
"
Kwabani lokusayina lokuvele kulokusalungiswa lokubhalwe ngesandla?,"The correct answer is **D: Ya-Charles Thomson**.

The passage states: ""kwatiswa lokubhaliwe lokusayinwe nguMengameli waleNgcungcutsela John Hancock kanye namaBhalane Charles Thomson kwatfunyelwa endzaweni lesedvutane esitolo sekuphrinta sa-John Dunlap."" (the signed written notice by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the nearby printing shop of John Dunlap).

The question asks who signed the original draft and the passage states that both John Hancock and Charles Thomson signed the notice. Since Charles Thomson is the only option provided from the two names listed, it is the correct answer.
"
"Kuletindzawo letilandzelako, kukuphi lapho i-Dunlap broadside yafika khona ekugcineni?","The correct answer is **C: e-London**.

The passage states, ""Ikhophi yafika eLondon mhlaka-10 ngeNgci"" (A copy arrived in London on August 10th).
"
Bewahlala kuphi emasotja a-Colonel Stark?,"The passage says: ""Emadvodza aStark abegudle fenisi eme ngale kulelelinye live. Ngekhatsi kwehla kwemanti lokuphansi kuvula umsele kulomfula iMystic ngasenyakatfo-mphumalanga yePeninsula, ngekushesha kwanweba lelidaladi ngelibondza lelitje lelifisha ngasekugcineni lokusenyakatfo kwalomngcengcema wemanti elwandle loluncane.""

This means Stark's men were along a fence, and near a tidal creek on the northeast of the peninsula, that was expanded into a short stone wharf on the northern end of a small bay. This most closely aligns with option A, and it doesn't mention specifically which part they were on. Thus A: Emaphetselweni asenyakatfo, dvute nedalada (At the Northern edge, near the wharf)

So the answer is A.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, emadvodza aStark alule dalada wawo?","The correct answer is **C: Ngesikhatsi seligagazi lelincane**.

The passage states: ""Ngekhatsi kwehla kwemanti lokuphansi kuvula umsele kulomfula iMystic ngasenyakatfo-mphumalanga yePeninsula, ngekushesha kwanweba lelidaladi ngelibondza lelitje lelifisha ngasekugcineni lokusenyakatfo kwalomngcengcema wemanti elwandleni loluncane."" This directly translates to: ""During low tide a shallow ford opened up on the Mystic River northeast of the Peninsula, they quickly widened the ford with a short stone bridge toward the north end of the swampy beach."" This means the widening of the ford/causeway with a short stone bridge happened during low tide (kwehla kwemanti lokuphansi).
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kwalokungulokunye kwetikhatsi teludlame kakhulu eChina?","The correct answer is **D: Sikhatsi Semibuso Lemitsatfu**.

The passage explicitly states: ""LeMibuso Lemitsatfu kubusa kwayo kwaba sikhatsi lokwacitseka ngaso kakhulu ingati emlandvweni waseShayina.""
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, liyini liciniso ngemasotja etintfutfwane letingena esigabeni sekuzulazula?","The correct answer is **A: Bahlala ebusuku**.

The passage states: ""Ngesikhatsi sekuzulazula, tintfutfwane letilubutfo timasha ebusuku futsi time emini kuze tiphumule."" (During the nomadic phase, army ants march at night and stop during the day to rest.)

Therefore, the army ants march/live at night (Bahlala ebusuku).
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngusiphi sitatimende lesikhombisa ngalokungiko imikhuba yekuhlala kwemasotja etintfutfwane phakatsi nesigaba sekutilula?","The correct answer is **C: Bashintja tidleke wonkhe malanga**.

The passage states: ""Kulesikhatsi, lekholoni yenta tilulu tesikhashana letishintjwako onkhe emalanga."" This directly translates to ""During this time, the colony makes temporary shelters that change every day."" This refers to the bivouacking stage (described as concerning when food becomes scarce) - this is the ""tilula"" stage you mentioned, and the answer is that they change bivouacs every day.
"
Ngikuphi lokulandzelako lokutochubeka nangetulu kwekubakhona kwetimphawu tangaphandle?,"The passage states: ""Emawashi laphilako langema-oscillator latigcinako latochubeka sikhatsi sekugijima noma tingekho tinkhomba tangaphandle.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Emawashi etintfo letiphilako** (Biological clocks).
"
Nguliphi ligama lelichaza bantfu labakhombisa kuhluka kwesici lesitsite se-phenotypic?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphic**.

The passage states: ""Nangabe bantfu bakhombisa kuhluka esicini lesitsite kutsiwa ba-polymorphic."" which translates to ""If individuals show variation in a certain trait they are called polymorphic.""
"
Nguliphi ligama lelifanele kulawa lalandzelako etintfo letiphilako letihlala endzaweni letsite?,"The correct answer is **B: Linani lebantfu**.

The passage defines a ""linani lebantfu"" as a collection of living things of a certain type in a given area. This matches the question's definition of organisms living in a specific location.
"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungeke kube sibonelo semsebenti wekuvakasha losuselwe tikwendalo?,"The correct answer is **D: Kudoba tindiza**.

Here's why:

*   **Ecotourism** is about enjoying and learning about the *natural* environment.

*   **A, B, and C** all involve appreciating or learning about nature:

    *   **A: Kuhamba ngetinyawo kuya empophomeni (Hiking to a waterfall):** Enjoying a natural landscape.
    *   **B: Kutfwebula timbali tasendle (Photographing wildflowers):** Appreciating and documenting natural beauty.
    *   **C: Kuvakashela imnyuziyemu yesayensi (Visiting a science museum):** Learning about the natural world.

*   **D: Kudoba tindiza (Fishing for planes)** is related to aircraft, which are man-made and have nothing to do with natural tourism.

Therefore, **D** is not an example of ecotourism."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokusisekelo sendlela yekusebenta yetekutfutsa?","Based on the paragraph provided, the answer is **A: Tindzawo tekusebenta**.

The paragraph explicitly states that people travel from small towns to their workplaces every morning, and that these workplaces are where they meet people from those towns. This highlights the workplace as a central point in their daily commute and transportation routine. The rest of the paragraph discusses historical trade routes, ancient defense systems in Turkey, and the evolution of carbon, none of which directly relates to the fundamental aspect of modern transportation described in the first sentence.
"
Tincenye letitungeleta i-nucleus tinaluphi luhlobo lekushaja?,"The correct answer is **C: Kushaja lokungasikahle**.

The passage states: ""Ema-electrons ane-negative electric charge"" and ""Libhizinisi lelilikhuni, lihlanganisa i-nucleus letungeletwa nema-elctron..."". Therefore, the particles that orbit the nucleus (electrons) have a negative charge.
"
I-nucleus yakhiwe ngutiphi tincenye?,"The correct answer is **A: Emaphrothoni nema neutrons**.

The passage states: ""Inyukliyasi inetintfo letimbili - emanyuthroni nemaphrothoni."" (The nucleus has two components - neutrons and protons.)
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokusibonelo senombolo yanombolombili lemihlanu?","The correct answer is **C: 10010**

Here's why:

*   **The question asks for a five-digit binary number.** Binary numbers only contain 0s and 1s.
*   **A: 1010** has four digits.
*   **B: 12001** contains the digits '2', which makes it not a binary number.
*   **C: 10010** has five digits and contains only 0s and 1s.
*   **D: 110101** has six digits.

Therefore, option C is the only one that fits the description of a five-digit binary number.
"
Tinombolo tanombolombili tiphindze tibitwe ngekutsi tiyini?,"Impendvulo lelungile ngu- **A: Emabhithi**

Phendvulo lese ngiyo yentelwa kucinisekisa ukuthi lesicubu sisebenza ngekufanele:
The passage states: ""...these digits are called binary digits - or bits, as the terminology used in computers.""
This explicitly defines binary digits as bits.
"
Ngikuphi lokulandzelako lokungakashiwo endzimeni njengenzuzo leyiyinhloko yeku-bhuloga bafundzi?,"Let's analyze each option based on the passage:

*   **A: Intutfuko ehlelweli lelulwimi nelukhono lekubhala** The passage directly mentions that students improve their grammar and spelling due to the public nature of blogging. So, this is a benefit mentioned in the passage.

*   **B: Kuncipha kwekugcekwa bontsanga** The passage states that students strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism. This implies a reduction in peer criticism, but it is not the primary argument.

*   **C: Kucaphela lokunabile ngendzawo letungeletiwe** The passage quotes Toto (2004) about blogs ""forcing students to be more thoughtful observers of their world."" This confirms increased awareness as a benefit.

*   **D: Kwandza kwesifiso sekuchubeka nekufundza** The passage mentions that blogs encourage students to extend learning beyond the typical school day. This signifies increased desire to continue learning.

Option B is implied and not stated directly. The others are directly mentioned.

**Therefore, the correct answer is B: Kuncipha kwekugcekwa bontsanga**"
Ngutiphi kuletincenye letilandzelako tekubhuloga letibalulwe njengetikhutsati kubafundzi kutsi batfutfukise emakhono abo ekubhala?,"The correct answers are **B and C**. Here's why:

*   **B: Sifiso sekugwema kugcekwa (Desire to avoid criticism)**: The passage states, ""Njengobe bafundzi kungibo labafundza kakhulu tincwadzi, labo lababhala tincwadzi balwela kutfutfukisa indlela lababhala ngayo kuze bagweme kugcekwa."" (Since students are the ones who read the writings the most, those who write the writings strive to improve the way they write to avoid being criticized.)
*   **C: Kugcina sitsakaselo setilaleli (Maintaining the interest of the audience)**: The passage mentions that the need to be interesting to people makes students smarter and more motivated (Toto, 2004).

Let's look at why the other options are not the best answers:

*   **A: Lokuvame kuphendvula etintfweni letivela ku-inthanethi (Frequently responding to things that come from the internet):** While the passage mentions responding to online content, it emphasizes the analytical and critical thinking skills developed through this, rather than it being a direct motivator for improved *writing* skills in itself.
*   **D: Sidzingo sekubambisana (The need to collaborate):** While collaboration is mentioned as a benefit of blogging, the passage doesn't directly link it to being a *motivation* for students to *improve their writing skills*.

**Therefore, the best answers that are directly mentioned as motivators for improving writing are B and C.**
"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo inzuzo yekuchumana lokungavumelani kwebafundzi? ,"The correct answer is **B: Kufinyelela kwebuso nebuso kubafundzisi nanoma ngusiphi sikhatsi selusuku**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage emphasizes asynchronous communication:** Asynchronous communication means communication that doesn't happen in real-time. Examples given in the text include students working at their own pace, accessing information online at any time, and asking teachers questions and getting answers later.
*   **Option B describes synchronous communication:** ""Kufinyelela kwebuso nebuso kubafundzisi nanoma ngusiphi sikhatsi selusuku"" (Face-to-face access to teachers at any time of day) implies real-time interaction, which is the *opposite* of asynchronous communication.
*   **The other options align with asynchronous benefits:**
    *   A: Kusetjentiswa kwe-inthanethi njengensita (The use of the internet as a resource) is a key part of asynchronous learning, allowing students to access information independently.
    *   C: Emahora ekusebenta lagucugucukako (Flexible working hours) is a benefit because students can learn at times that suit them.
    *   D: Kulawula litubane (Controlling the pace) This allows learners to work at their own speed.

Therefore, option B is the only one that is NOT an advantage of asynchronous communication; rather, it describes an element of synchronous learning, which is not what the passage focuses on."
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, nguyiphi kuletincenye letilandzelako tekuchumana lokungafaki sikhatsi kwebafundzi lokungavumelana netimo?","The correct answer is **A: Sivinini sekufundza (Pace of learning)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that asynchronous communication ""allows students to work at their own pace and control the speed of their learning."" This directly relates to the pace of learning.

The other options are less directly related to the *flexibility* offered by asynchronous communication in the context described in the passage:

*   **B: Emahora ekusebenta (Working hours):** While asynchronous communication *can* offer flexibility in working hours, the passage focuses on the timing of communication and learning interactions.
*   **C: Tintfo tekufundzisa (Learning materials):** Asynchronous communication can influence *access* to materials (as discussed in the passage regarding the internet), but not fundamentally change what those materials *are.*
*   **D: Kusetjentiswa kwe-inthanethi (Internet usage):** The passage highlights how the internet *enables* asynchronous communication, but the question is about which aspect of student experience it makes flexible."
Yini lengakabalwa kulendzima njengentfo umuntfu langahle ayihlanganise netincaba tesikhatsi se-medieval?,"The correct answer is **D: Ema-Knights**.

The passage mentions ""titfombe temlingo emidlalweni, emadzilini kanye ne-Arthurian"" (which relates to jousts and magic), and ""liphunga lekwesaba lelichamuka emigodzini yemajele"" (dungeons). It doesn't mention knights directly, only Arthurian legends which are often associated with them.
"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakakhulunywa endzimeni njengeliphunga noma umsindvo longavakala phakatsi kwemanciwa enkinga?,"The correct answer is **D: Tinselo**.

The passage mentions the sounds and smells of war, the feeling of fear emanating from dungeons, and the imagery of tournaments. However, it doesn't discuss the sounds or smells specifically associated with sieges.
"
Nguyiphi kulokulandzelako inchazelo lecondzile yeKirby Muxloe Castle?,"The correct answer is **B: Beyidzinga kuciniswa lokuncane ngenca yesimo selive lesinekuthula ngalesikhatsi kwakhiwa**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""the country was at peace, and defence was needed only against small bands of killers."" This directly supports the idea that little fortification was necessary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tindvonga letikhulu teCastle tacelwa nguLord Hastings** - While Lord Hastings started the construction, the passage implies the walls *weren't* strong, as they wouldn't withstand a serious attack.
*   **C: Kwakhiwa kweCastle bekungasiyo intfo levamile ngesikhatsi** - The passage doesn't say castle building was unusual.
*   **D: Yakhelwe kusekela kuhlaselwa lokudze nekutimisela** - The passage explicitly states the opposite: the castle wouldn't withstand sustained attack."
Ngutiphi kuleti tici letilandzelako tekwakha letingatsatfwa njengaletijwayelekile te-Kirby Muxloe Castle ngesikhatsi lesichazwe endzimeni?,"Based on the passage, the features considered typical for Kirby Muxloe Castle for the time period are:

*   **C: Kuciniswa lokuncane kunalamanye ema-Castle** - The passage explicitly states that Kirby Muxloe Castle was ""merely a fortified manor house rather than a true castle"" and that its defenses were inadequate.
*   **D: Emadvonga lamancane** - The text explicitly states that the ""thin walls"" could not withstand a sustained attack.
The correct answers are **C and D**"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungazuzisa kakhulu kumgijimi lolungiselela sikhatsi lesitako?","The correct answer is **D: Kusebentisa i-gym kutivocavoca umtimba losetulu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Leminye imicudzelwano yekugijima uze ungene kulelinye live ngesikhatsi sasebusika, ihlanganiswe nekujimisa incenye lengetulu yemtimba wakho, kuyindlela lekahle yekutilolongela umcudzelwano wekugijima."" This directly supports option D as being beneficial for training.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Kutijwayeta kugijima emaveni lahlukene ehlobo:** The passage specifically mentions running in a different country **during winter**.
*   **B: Gcila ekuhlakuleleni sivinini ngalesikhatsi ucecesha:** While speed is important, the passage emphasizes that endurance is more crucial when moving from quarter-mile to half-mile races. Also, the passage states that races longer than a half mile benefit from speed.
*   **C: Kushaya sikhatsi semizuzu lemitsatfu:** The passage mentions a 2-minute lead, but not as a specific goal to achieve in training. It uses the 2-minute lead as a hypothetical scenario that shows speed may still be important in longer distance races."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokubaluleke kakhulu kumgijimi welibanga lekucala?","Let's analyze the passage to determine the most important factor for a long-distance runner:

*   **Paragraph 1 states:** ""Ngalolushintjo kusuka ekugijimeni libanga leliyikota kuya ekugijimeni libanga lelinguhhafu, litubane liba yintfo lengasiyo lebaluleke kangako futsi kubeketela kuba ngiyo intfo lebalulekile."" This directly translates to: ""With the change from running a quarter mile to running a half mile, speed becomes less important and endurance becomes more important.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **B: Kuhlakulela kubeketela ngetulu kwelitubane (Developing endurance over speed)**"
"Kumsubatsi, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungeke kufezwe ngekusebentisa tinchubo tekudla lokunemsoco?","Ngenca yekutsi incenye yekucala yesitatimende itsi kudla lokunemsoco ngeke nje kukwente wente tintfo ngelizinga lelisetulu, kodvwa kungaba nemtselela etingijimini letisetincane ekuphileni kwato, imphendvulo lecondzile yi:

**C: Kusebenta lokuhle kakhulu**

Incazelo:

*   **P** itsi kudla lokunemsoco kungaholela ekwenteni tintfo ngelizinga lelisetulu.
*   Kukhetfwa lokunye lokutsi, ""Kusebenta lokuhle kakhulu"" kungalahlekisa.

Kukhetfwa lokunye lokutsi:

*   **A: Kusebenta lokutfutfukisiwe:** Kulungile, njengoba kudla lokunempilo kuholela ekusebenziseni imisipha nemithambo yegazi lekahle.
*   **B: Injabulo lengetiwe:** Kulungile, njengoba kudla lokunempilo kukhulula umzimba nezinto eziwugulisayo.
*   **D: Imphilo jikelele:** Kulungile, njengoba kudla lokunempilo kwenta umntfu abe nemphilo lekahle."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakaphakanyisa njengendlela yekuba basubatsi labasebasha batfole injabulo lengetiwe emdlalweni wabo?","Based on the passage, the answer is **B: Kusebenta ngalokuchubekako ezingeni lelisetulu.**

The passage mentions the following as ways to improve running and enjoyment:

*   Eating nutritious foods. (Related to A and D)
*   Maintaining good health and energy. (Related to D)
*   Training to maintain hydration.
*   Understanding how to use resources.

It doesn't specifically say that ""Kusebenta ngalokuchubekako ezingeni lelisetulu"" will help young athletes find greater enjoyment in their sport. While working hard is important, the passage focuses more on overall health, nutrition, hydration, and resourcefulness as key factors.

Therefore, the answer is B.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungani umsubatsi welibanga leliphakatsi angahle atsenge lucetu lemshini lobita kakhulu?","The correct answer is **D: Kenemibono leliphutsa mayelana nemishini lengabiti kakhulu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Libanga lelisemkhatsini akusiwo umdlalo lobitako; kodvwa ke, kunemibono lengesiyo mayelana netinsita letidzingekako kute udlale."" This directly translates to ""Middle distance running is not an expensive sport; however, there are misconceptions about the equipment needed to play.""

*   The passage then mentions that many things people buy have little to no impact and that runners might feel like they like a product even if it offers no benefit.

*   Therefore, the reason a middle-distance runner might buy an expensive piece of equipment is that they have misconceptions or false ideas about the equipment and what is necessary."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kugijima kwelibanga lelisemkhatsini kudzingani?","The passage says that many items purchased for middle-distance running have little or no effect. This implies that you need *very few* items, not many.  It also says some things can be bought ""as needed"". This indicates that you do not need a lot of money. Therefore, the best answer is:

**C: Imishini lencane kakhulu (Very little equipment)**
"
Ngubani lowatfola i-nuclear magnetic resonance? ,"The correct answer is **C: I-Bloch kanye ne-Purcell**

The passage clearly states: ""MRI imayelana ne-physicc phenomenon lebitwa nge-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), leyatfolwa ngabo 1930 ngu-Felix Bloch (asebenta eNyuvesi yaseStanford) na-Edward Purcell (lobuya eNyuvesi yeHarvard)."" This directly indicates that both Bloch and Purcell discovered NMR.
"
Lilungelo lekucala lebunikati laniketwa ngamuphi umnyaka yetekwelapha i-imaging resonance? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The passage states: ""Ngemuva kweminyaka lemine lilungelo lebunikati baniketwa, lelilungele belilekucala emhlabeni lelake laniketwa MRI."" which means: ""Four years later he was granted a patent, the first patent ever granted for MRI"". The preceding sentence says that Damadian found that magnetic resonance could be used for medical diagnosis and treatment in the 1970s. Thus, the patent was granted in 1974.
"
"ngekusho kwendzima, yini lekufanele kutsi bantfu bayivisise ngalokucinile kute bachaze tento talabanye letingekwenyama?","The correct answer is **B: Inhloso**.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes the importance of understanding the *motives* of others. The example of breaking the car window illustrates this point perfectly. You can't accurately interpret the action (breaking the window) without knowing the person's *intention* (to steal vs. to get into their own locked car). ""Inhloso"" translates directly to ""intention"" or ""motive.""

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Sifiso:** While desires/wishes (""sifiso"") can play a role, the passage specifically focuses on the *reason* or *purpose* behind an action, which is ""inhloso.""
*   **C: Inkolelo:** Beliefs (""inkolelo"") are important for understanding others, but the passage doesn't highlight them as the *primary* element for interpreting physical actions.
*   **D: Kucondza:** Understanding (""kucondza"") is a broad term. The passage narrows it down to understanding the *reason* behind the action, which is ""inhloso."""
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kuvisisa injongo kusita bantfu kutsi benteni?","The best answer is **A: Kucedza kungaciniseki ngemuva kwetento temtimba**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explains that understanding motives helps resolve disagreements or misunderstandings. The example of breaking the car window illustrates this perfectly. Without knowing the motive (lost keys vs. theft), you'd jump to the wrong conclusion. Knowing the motive eliminates the uncertainty surrounding the action.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Cagela tifiso:** The passage mentions guessing desires, but the main point is about understanding *motives* and how that helps resolve misunderstandings.
*   **C: Buka labanye bantfu ngaphandle kwekukwahlulela:** Understanding motives can lead to less judgment, but the primary function described is reducing uncertainty about actions.
*   **D: Fundza tingcondvo talabanye:** While understanding motives is related to understanding others' minds, the passage doesn't state we can *read* minds. It emphasizes making informed judgments based on understanding their reasons for action."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokufinciwe lokungiko kwenhloso ye-Al?","The correct answer is **C: Kuhlela (Planning)**.

The passage explicitly mentions ""kuhlela kanye nekwenta emlungiselelo"" (planning and making preparations) as an example of tasks that AI is being used to automate. While other options like ""Kukhumbula livi"" (remembering words/speech recognition) are related to AI's capabilities, ""kuhlela"" is directly listed as a key function.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lavame kuhlotjaniswa nako Al?","The correct answer is **B: Kuhlela kanye nekuhlela**.

The passage specifically mentions ""kuhlela kanye nekwenta emlungiselelo"" (planning and scheduling) as an example of tasks involving human intelligence that AI is being used to automate. While the other options are related to the passage, planning and scheduling is directly listed.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungemandla emuntfu lonemaphethini ekucabanga lagucukako?","The passage states that people with convergent thinking are good at remembering routines.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Khumbula emaphethini** (Remember patterns).
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungabukwa njengekugcila kwemcondvo wekucabanga logucukako?","The correct answer is **B: Kutsatsa sikhatsi semuntfu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a key aspect of convergent thinking is speed. Taking one's time would be the opposite of prioritizing speed. The other options (understanding a single right answer, identifying facts, and sharing information) all align with the characteristics of convergent thinking described in the passage.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi lokulandzelako lokungeke kutsatfwe njenge kusho lokuncane?","Ngenca yendzima, imphendvulo lelondzekile ngu **D: Kuphakamisa sitfupha**.

Ngutiphi titatimende letilandzelako mayelana nekutoliga kwe-micro-expression lokungasilo liciniso?,"The statement that is NOT true based on the provided text is:

*   **D: Kungasite kuhlola bucotho** (It is not helpful for evaluating honesty)

Here's why:

*   The text *directly states* that micro-expression analysis, through video capture, *can* help detect deception by observing fleeting facial movements.
*   The reference to Olive Sacks *supports* this, showing that even individuals with language comprehension difficulties can still assess sincerity through facial cues."
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokwabaluleka kakhulu ngenca ye-Renaissance? ,"The correct answer is **B: Kujikeletisa lwati** (Circulation of knowledge).

Here's why:

* **Passage P focuses on a shift:** It describes a change in how knowledge is accessed and learned. It contrasts a previous era where rote memorization was key with a new era of broader access and learning.
* **Renaissance and Knowledge Dissemination:** The Renaissance was characterized by a surge in the spread of information due to inventions like the printing press. This allowed for much wider dissemination of knowledge than relying on individual memory or hand-copying.
* **Why the other options are less suitable:**
    * **A: Inkhumbulo yemuntfu ngamunye (Individual memory):** The passage contrasts the shift away from a heavy reliance on individual memory. The Renaissance *reduced* dependence on individual memorization due to the spread of books.
    * **C: Khumbula umbhalo (Remembering the text):**  Similar to A, the passage indicates a move away from this focus.
    * **D: Kutfola umniningwane (Obtaining information):** While accessing information is a part of it, the passage stresses the *change* in how information is *shared* and disseminated. The Renaissance was more impactful in *spreading* information widely.

Therefore, **B: Kujikeletisa lwati** best reflects the core idea of the Renaissance and the shift described in passage P.

"Njengemphumela we-Renaissance, ngukuphi lokwagcizelelwa kancane kulokulandzelako?","The correct answer is **A: Inkhumbulo yemuntfu ngamunye**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...bekungenancindzelelwa lehlala emuntfwini loyedvwa, kodvwa likhono lekukhumbula lokubhaliwe ngilo lekwakugcilwe kulo."" (Translation: ""...there was no emphasis on an individual, but the ability to memorize text was the focus."")

* **The passage implies:** The Renaissance, as a period of change, shifted the focus *away* from individual memory and *towards* other aspects of learning and information dissemination.

Therefore, individual memory was *de-emphasized* as a result of the changes brought about during and around the Renaissance. The other options (obtaining knowledge, memorizing text, dissemination of knowledge) were either emphasized or remained relevant in some form.

Inshonalanga ye-Europe iyekela nini kutsembela kakhulu ekucaleni futsi yacala kutfutfukisa sitayela sayo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngasekupheleni kwetikhatsi letiphakatsi** (Ngasekupheleni kwesikhatsi lesibitwa ngekutsi iMiddle Ages).

The passage explicitly states that Western Europe began developing its own style ""ngasekupheleni kwesikhatsi lesibitwa ngekutsi iMiddle Ages"" (towards the end of the Middle Ages).
"
Kusebentisa tinkinobho kute kuhlanganiswe tingubo kwaba ngumphumela wani? ,"The correct answer is **C: Tinkholo**.

The passage states that ""Lokunye kutfutfuka kwalesikhatsi ngenca yaletimphi tebantfu telukholo bantfu bacala kusebentisa tinkinobho kufasa timphahla"" which translates to ""One of the developments of this time due to the crusades people began to use buttons to fasten clothes."" This directly links the use of buttons to religious wars (timphi tebantfu telukholo).
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokubonwa njengesicatululo lesisebentako sesikhatsi lesidze etindzabeni temvelo?","The correct answer is **C: Kukhomba imbangela yendzaba (Identifying the root cause of the problem)**.

The passage explicitly states that to avoid temporary solutions, we need to find and eliminate the source of the environmental problems. This aligns with option C, which is identifying the root cause. Options A, B, and D are presented as actions that are similar to treating the symptoms of a disease, offering only temporary relief.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngusiphi kuleticatululo letilandzelako lesingeke sitsatfwe njenge kulashwa lokutimphawu tetindzaba temvelo?","The passage states that dealing with the symptoms of a problem is like treating a disease symptomatically. It then says that to avoid a short-term solution, we need to address the source of the problem. This implies that addressing the source is *not* symptomatic treatment.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Kutibandzakanya emsebentini (Getting involved in activism):** The passage mentions joining environmental organizations as a way to mitigate future suffering. This falls under dealing with the effects of the problem (like symptoms).
*   **B: Kuvala timbangela tetinkinga (Eliminating the root causes of problems):** This is explicitly stated as the opposite of treating symptoms.
*   **C: Kuveta imibono mayelana nekukhetsa lokubukhatikhati yekuphila (Presenting opinions on critical life choices):** The passage notes how human overpopulation and people's careless lifestyles have created the environmental issues. This falls under the root cause, and the action in Option C would lead to mitigating these behaviours.
*   **D: Kuphila ngendlela levumelana nemvelo (Living an environmentally friendly lifestyle):** The passage mentions that being environmentally friendly is one way to live life. This action could also stop environmental issues.

Therefore, the answer is **B: Kuvala timbangela tetinkinga (Eliminating the root causes of problems)** because the question asks what is NOT symptomatic treatment. Eliminating the root causes addresses the underlying problem rather than just the symptoms. C and D are also related to tackling the root cause. Therefore, **A** is the best option.

Beyikuliphi live impi yekucala e-Europe lebekutsiwa indzaba yayo leyinhloko ihlobene nekulinganisela kwemandla kunekutsi ibe nekonga kwenkholo?,"The correct answer is **D: E-Spain**.

The passage states, ""Impi yekutsi ngubani labefanele kubusa leyaliwa Spain yaba yimpi yekucala lebe umgomo wayo kukukhombisa kutsi ngubani lonemandla."" This clearly indicates that the war fought over who should rule Spain was the first war primarily aimed at demonstrating the balance of power.
"
Nguyiphi impi lechazwa ngekutsi impi yenkholo yekugcina ngalesinye sikhatsi?,"The correct answer is **A: Impi Yeminyaka Lemashumi Lamatsatfu**

The passage states, ""...ngako leMphi Yeminyaka Lengemashumi Lamatsatfu beyitawuba yekugcina kutsi ibitwe ngekutsi yimphi yenkholo."" which translates to ""...therefore the Thirty Years' War would be the last one to be called a religious war.""
"
Nguyiphu kuletici letilandzelako telisontfo lemaCatholic lebeyingahlolisiswa?,"The correct answer is **A: Uma lokwabiwe kwemcebo phakatsi ebandleni kufanelekile** and **D: Kube bekuhlangabetwana netimfundziso letisemcoka telisontfo**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Uma lokwabiwe kwemcebo phatsi ebandleni kufanelekile:** The passage explicitly states that the Church was wealthy and powerful, and that some of its core tenets involved using wealth to alleviate suffering. This sets the stage for scrutiny about whether the Church's wealth was being used appropriately according to its stated principles.

*   **D: Kube bekuhlangabetwana netimfundziso letisemcoka telisontfo:** The passage states ""...lokunaka kwemandla nemali kwaholela kutsi labaningi babe nembuto wekutsi lomtsetfo uyagcinwa yini."". ""Lomtsetfo"" refers to the ""core principles"" or teachings of the church, therefore this is an important element of the analysis/inspection.

*   **B: Uma timiso letiyinhloko yenkholo kufanele tichibiyelwe:** The passage focuses on the *application* of existing principles, not whether the principles themselves should be changed.

*   **C: Kuhlangana kwemandla ngekhatsi kwelisontfo:** While the concentration of power within the Church is mentioned as a *context* for the scrutiny, the *primary* focus of the scrutiny is how that power and wealth were being used.

**In summary:** The passage presents a situation where the Catholic Church's wealth and power were under scrutiny, particularly in relation to its stated principles of using wealth to alleviate suffering. Therefore, the allocation of wealth and the adherence to core teachings would be the main focus of the investigation."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani lowabulawa eVersailles?","The correct answer is **D: Umgadi** (guard).

The passage states ""Kulesinye sigaba lilunga lalesicumbi liphakamise inhloko yanogadza wasebukhosini lobulewe eVarsailles..."" which translates to ""At one point a member of the crowd raised the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles..."" This clearly indicates that a guard was killed in Versailles.

"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lobekungasiwo umphumela wempi lengakajwayeleki yaseBritain?,"The passage focuses on the consequences of Britain's naval blockade and Germany's subsequent unrestricted submarine warfare. Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: Sifiso seJalimani sekusebentisa emachinga lafanako empi (Germany's desire to use similar warfare tactics):** The passage *explicitly states* that Germany responded to Britain's actions with its own unrestricted submarine warfare, mirroring the strategy. Thus, this was a consequence.

*   **B: Imikhumbi lengakahlangani yafakwa engotini (Neutral ships were put in danger):** The passage mentions that Britain's mining of international waters put even neutral ships at risk. This was a direct consequence of Britain's blockade.

*   **C: Kwentiwa tingucuko emtsetfweni wemave wonkhe (Changes were made to international law):** While the passage mentions Britain's blockade violated international law, it doesn't say changes were *made* to the law as a result. It just notes the violation.

*   **D: Timphahla letibalulekile betingatfolakali (Essential goods were not available):** While the passage doesn't state that essential goods were not available, the blockade prevented supplies and soldiers to enter the region.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C: Kwentiwa tingucuko emtsetfweni wemave wonkhe (Changes were made to international law)**. The passage only mentions the *violation* of international law, not any subsequent changes to it.
"
Ngusiphi sitatimende lesingakuchazi kahle kuvinjwa kwemikhumbi yempi yase-Britain ngalokumelene neJalimani?,"The correct answer is **D: Kucinisekise kutsi imikhumbi ldngatsatsi hlangotsi angeke ibe engotini**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Britain's mining of international waters created danger for *neutral* ships. Therefore, the blockade did *not* ensure the safety of neutral ships.

The other options are supported by the passage:

*   **A: Kuphambane nemtsetfo wemave wonkhe:** The passage explicitly says the blockade violated established international law.
*   **B: Kwabangela impi yemikhumbi-ngwenya faseJalimani:** The passage mentions that Germany responded with unrestricted submarine warfare in retaliation.
*   **C: Kuphatamise kuhamba kwetimphahla taseJalimani:** The blockade aimed to cut off supplies to Germany."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungaba kwabani kucilongwa kwe-Multiple Sclerosis?","Let's analyze the information provided in passage P:

*   MS is a leading cause of disability in young to middle-aged people.
*   Women are more likely to develop MS than men.

Based on these points, the most likely candidate for a diagnosis of MS from the options is a woman in the young to middle-aged range.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Wesifazane loneminyaka lengu-32** (A 32-year-old woman)"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, bahlanganyeli emisebentini levamile bebadzinga kusekelwa lokungetiwe kwani?","The correct answer is **A: Umbono lomubi webuhlungu**.

The passage states that those who regularly participate in activities need support in dealing with ""indleleni yekuva buhlungu lengeyinhle"" which translates to ""negative pain perception"".  This aligns with option A, ""Umbono lomubi webuhlungu"" which means ""negative view of pain"".
"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, kubiya kuvame kudlalwa njani?","The correct answer is **D: Ngefomethi ye-duel**.

The passage states ""Lomdlalo ngalokuyinhloko udlalwa bantfu lababili, lomunye adlale nalomunye,"" which means the game is played between two people, like a duel.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kwalokulandzelako lokungaba inkhomba lenemandla yebutsi baphakatsi?","Impendvulo lengiyo ngu **D: Libhodlela leliphilisi ladokotela**

Incenye ithi ""Inkomba lekahle kakhulu yekutsi udle shevu kungaba kutfolakala kwesigubhu lesivuliwe semutsi noma ikhemikhali yasekhaya lenebutsi"". Libhodlela leliphilisi ladokotela liyaba yimvama yesigubhu semutsi, ngako-ke imphendvulo D iyimphendvulo lekahle.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngusiphi sinyatselo sekucala lesifanele uma uhlola sisulu?","The correct answer is **A: Buka lesimo**.

The passage clearly states: ""Nawufuna kusita lomuntfu losenkhingeni kufanele ucale uhlolisise lendzawo lakwenteke khona lengoti kuze ucinisekise kuphepha kwakho."" This translates to: ""If you want to help someone in trouble, you must first assess the scene of the accident to ensure your own safety."" Therefore, assessing the scene (Buka lesimo) is the first step.
"
Ngusiphi sitatimende kuletilandzelako lesingakhombisa ngalokungiko inchobo yekuhlola sisulu?,"The correct answer is **B: Hlola Indzawo yesigameko ngaphambi kwalojlukumetekile**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of assessing the scene for safety before approaching the victim.** The first sentence directly states this: ""Nawufuna kusita lomuntfu losenkhingeni kufanele ucale uhlolisise lendzawo lakwenteke khona lengoti kuze ucinisekise kuphepha kwakho"" (If you want to help someone in trouble, you must first assess the scene of the accident to ensure your safety).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ungakhatsateki ngekutilimata wena** (Don't worry about injuring yourself) This is the opposite of what the passage advises. It is crucial to prioritize your own safety.
* **C: Buka sikhundla salohlukumetekile** (Look at the position of the victim) While important, this comes *after* ensuring scene safety. The passage specifically mentions observing the victim's position as you approach, but only *after* you've deemed the area safe.
* **D: Zama kucaphela noma nguyiphi imijeko** (Try to spot any jokes) This is nonsensical in the context.

Ngutiphi tingucuko letibangwe Ingucuko yaseFrance yaba nemtsetfo lomkhulu kutakhamuti setigaba setisebenti?,"The most direct consequence of the French Revolution on the working class mentioned in the text is:

*   **B: Kushintja kwekugcila esigabeni kuya ekhonweni (Shifting the focus from class to ability)**

The text explicitly states that after the revolution, jobs were open to all men who applied, allowing those who wanted to succeed to do so. In the military, soldiers were placed based on merit instead of their social class. This shift from class to ability is the most pertinent change."
"Ngemuva kwengucuko yaseFrance, kuphumelela kwetimpi nakuleminye imisebenti bekungahle kusekelwe kuphi?","The correct answer is **D: Lizinga** (Merit).

The passage explicitly states:

*   ""...imysebenzi yavuleka kubo bonkhe besilisa labafaka ticelo kuze labo labafuna kuphumelela baphumelele."" (Jobs were open to all men applying so that those who sought success would succeed.)
*   ""...esikhundleni sekutsi emasotja emphi abekwe esigabeni lesitsite ngesigaba sawo manje sekabekwa ngekwelizinga lemsebenti wawo."" (Instead of soldiers being ranked by their class, they were now ranked by their level of merit.)

This makes it clear that after the French Revolution, success in military and other endeavors was based on **merit** (how well you performed) rather than your social class."
Nguyiphi inkondzo yemphakatsi lekutsiwa ibanga kunganeliseki kakhulu emaveni latfutfukile?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: Tekutfutsa temphakatsi**.

The passage explicitly states that ""Cishe bonkhe bantfu bayakhonona ngetintfo tekuhamba temphakatsi."" and questions why public transportation systems are always subject to complaints.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lengashiwo mayelana netinhlelo tetekutfutsa temphakatsi?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**C: Tibanga tikhalo letiningi ngalabo labatisebentisako**

The passage states ""Cishe bonkhe bantfu bayakhonona ngetintfo tekuhamba temphakatsi"" which translates to ""Almost everyone complains about public transportation."" This directly supports option C.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungaba matima kukukala ngenca yekungabikeki kwebashayeli?","The correct answer is **D: Kuhamba kwesiminyeminye**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""kudadisha kuhamba kwetimoto kulikhuni ngoba lokwentiwa bashayeli ngeke sekucombakaleke ngekukholwa lokuphelele"" (studying traffic flow is difficult because drivers' actions cannot be predicted with complete certainty).
*   ""Kuhamba kwesiminyeminye"" (traffic flow) is directly affected by the individual actions of drivers, making it the most difficult to measure due to their unpredictability.

The other options are less directly related to the unpredictable actions of individual drivers:

*   Sivinini sesiminyeminye (speed of traffic) - while influenced by individual drivers, it's a more aggregate measure that can be estimated.
*   Kuhlela Umgwaco (road planning) and Imisebenti yemgwaco (road works) - these are planning and construction activities that, while taking traffic flow into account, are not directly hampered by the unpredictable nature of individual driver behavior in the same way that measuring overall flow is."
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokusebentiswa umele kusakatwa kwekuphitsitela kwetimoto ngetibalo?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Kuminyana kwetimoto**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states a relationship exists between flow, density (kushuba), and speed. This relationship is used for planning, construction, and operation of roadways. Since density is ""kushuba"" in Siswati and one of the three related factors, kuminyana kwetimoto (traffic density) is the answer. The other factors are kugeleta(flow) and sivinini (speed).

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Imisebenti yemgwaco (Road work)**: While road work can impact traffic flow, the passage focuses on a mathematical relationship between flow, density, and speed, not the disruption caused by road work.
*   **B: Kutiphatsa kwemshayeli (Driver behavior)**: Driver behavior is mentioned as being difficult to predict perfectly, but the focus is on how overall patterns can be mathematically modeled.
*   **C: Umklamo wemgwaco (Road design)**: Road design benefits from the traffic flow relationship but is not the relationship itself."
Hershey naChase basebentise ini kufaka i-DNA yabo? ,"The correct answer is **D: Emagciwane**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hershey naChase basebentisa emagciwane lokutsiwa yi-phages, noma lamanye emagciwane, kuze bahlanyele yabo i-DNA ibe yibhakthiriya."" This directly indicates that they used viruses (phages) to introduce their DNA. While radioactive phosphorus and sulfur were used to *tag* the DNA and protein, respectively, they were not the mechanism of delivery.
"
Lukhono lekugucula takhi telufuto tindlulele entalweni lencike kuphi?,"The correct answer is **A: Uma emaseli ayi-germ-line**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kugucuka kwesimo lokusetinhlayiyeni ema-germ-line kungadluliselwa kubantfwana..."" (Mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to offspring). This makes option A the most direct and accurate answer to the question of what determines the heritability of a mutation.
"
"Ngalokusekelwe elwatini lolunikelwe endzimeni, yini imiphumela lehlukahlukene yekugucuka kwetakhi telufuto lekungakancikwa kulo?","The passage explicitly states that the consequences of mutation depend on:

*   ""loluhlobo lwekugucuka kwesimo"" (the type of mutation)
*   ""kubaluleka kwalencenye yelufuto letsintsekile"" (the significance of the affected part of the genome)
*   ""nekutsi letinhlayiya letitsintsekile tinhlayiya te-germ-line noma cha"" (whether the affected cells are germ-line cells)

Therefore, the correct answer is **A, B, C, and D** or **All of the above**."
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lobekungasiso sizathu sekutsi emasiko akudzala afuye timbuti?,"The correct answer is **C: Titsembisa bungani**.

The passage mentions that goats were domesticated for milk, hair, meat, and hides. It doesn't mention companionship or friendship as a reason. While goats might have become companions to the herders, the initial domestication was for practical resources.
"
Umgomo wegalufu kutsatsa linani lelincane lani?,"The correct answer is **B: Ema-Stokes** (Ema-Stokes).

The description in passage P says ""Umdlali lojikijela tikhatsi letimbalwa kulekilabhu kuze acedze lomdlalo uyaphumelela."" which translates to ""The player who swings the fewest times with their club to finish the game wins.""  ""Tikhatsi"" here refers to the number of strokes.
"
"Ebaleni legalufu, bukuphi tjani lobujutjwe bafinyetwa?","The correct answer is **B: Lapho kuluhlata khona**.

The passage states that the grass ""emaceleni alesigodzi uhhulwa ube mncane futsi ubutwa ngekutsi luhlata"" which translates to ""the grass on the sides of the field is cut short and called the green"". Therefore, the grass that is cut short is where it is green.
"
Nguyiphi inhloso yekuhlola levamile?,"The correct answer is **A: Kucedza inkholelo-mbono leyodvwa noma ngetulu lokungenteka**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that experiments are ""a way to eliminate unfounded beliefs."" This directly aligns with option A, which speaks about eliminating potential misconceptions.
* While B, C, and D are all related to the broader scientific process, the passage specifically links experiments to the process of discarding unproven beliefs."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lengasiti kucondzisa lucwaningo lesayensi?","The best answer is **A: Indlela yesayensi yodvwa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Umgomo loyinhloko wesayensi kutfola kutsi live lisebenta njani ngetintfo tesayensi. Lendlela ecinisweni icondzisa lucwaningo lwabososayensi.""  This directly translates to: ""The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides scientific research.""

Let's look at why the other options aren't as strong:

* **B: Kwenta imibono (Creating ideas)** While generating hypotheses is part of the scientific process, the *method* itself is what guides the overall research.
* **C: Kucedza imibono lengenteka (Eliminating potential ideas)** This is a part of the scientific process (through experimentation), but the scientific method is the overall framework.
* **D: Kwenta tivivinyo (Conducting experiments)** Experiments are a key part of the scientific method, but again, the *method* is the broader guiding principle.

The passage emphasizes that the *scientific method* (indlela yesayensi) is the guiding force behind scientific research.

Here's why:

*   **A: Tivame kuhlala emahora langetulu kulamatsatfu** - The paragraph only states that *the most powerful* tornadoes can last for over 3 hours. It does not say this is common for all tornadoes.
*   **B: Takha moya cishe emamayela langu-480 ngelihora** - The paragraph mentions the speed of 480 km/h (300 mph) in the context of *one* tornado example, not all tornadoes in general.
*   **C: Titsintsa tindzawo letikhulu kunaletinye yiphepho** - The first sentence specifically states that tornadoes affect a *smaller* area than other powerful storms.
*   **D: Tiyakhona kudzabula tihlahla phasi** - The passage directly states that tornadoes can ""dzephula tihlahla ngetimphandze tato"" (uproot trees). This means they can tear trees from the ground.

Therefore, only option D is an accurate general statement based on the provided text."
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako labacale kukwenta bantfu eminyakeni lengu-16 ekhulwini?,"The correct answer is **D: Kwenta tibonakudze**.

The passage explicitly states that the first true telescopes were made in Europe towards the end of the 16th century. While people had been using lenses for magnifying things for thousands of years (implying they made lenses and used them), the *creation of telescopes* specifically happened in the 16th century.
"
Kunini bantfu bakhulisa tintfo basebentisa emalensi?,"The passage states that people have been making and using lenses to view things up close for thousands of years. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states Muhammad sought solitude and contemplation in the cave. It mentions the cave as a place to ""ayocabanga"" (to think/contemplate).
*   The description emphasizes the isolation of the cave, its remoteness, and the absence of worldly distractions, creating a peaceful environment for spiritual reflection.
*   The phrase ""Nasewusekhatsi emhumeni, uba wedvwana"" (When you are inside the cave, you are alone)
*   The passage states the cave as: ""Kute lokubonakalako ngaphandle kwesibhakabhaka lesisetulu lesicacile, futsi lesihle naletintsaba letinengi letitungeletile. Lokuncane kakhulu kwalomhlaba kungabonakala nobe kuviwe ngekhatsi kwalomhume."" (Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful high sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of the world can be seen or heard inside the cave).

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Umsindvo wangaphandle ungasita kucabangela** - The text emphasizes the LACK of external noise and distractions.
*   **C: Bekadzinga sikhatsi lesincane kakhulu kuba yedvwa** - The fact that he regularly went to the cave for extended periods suggests he valued solitude.
*   **D: Bekajake kubukwa nekuvakala** - The description of the cave as remote and isolated contradicts this. He sought solitude, not attention."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini leyasebentiswa insimbi kwekucala?","The correct answer is **D: Tipolo**.

The passage states: ""Kwekubopha siporo sesitimela ekucaleni kwakwentelwe kutsi kubambe siporo singagudluki. Nanobe kunjalo, kwabonakala kutsi tiporo tingacina kakhulu natingaba nokusansimbi ngetulu."" This means that iron was first used on the **tipolo** (rail ties) to make them stronger.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungani emasondvo esigodvo atsatselwa masondvo ensimbi?","The correct answer is **D: Bebagcitjwa yinsimbi kujantji**.

The passage states that the iron rails caused significant damage to the wooden wheels of the wagons. This is the direct reason for replacing them with iron wheels.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubaphi bantfu labalolongekile emkhatsini nemkhatsi we-Romanticism?","The correct answer is **C: Ngekwetifiso** (Individual desires).

Here's why:

* **P:** The passage states that Romanticism is ""lokukuvumela lotsite akulawule"" which translates to ""allowing the individual to be in control."" This implies that individual desires and feelings are central to Romanticism.
* **Q:** The question asks what shaped/influenced Romanticism according to the passage.

While culture (D) is impacted *by* Romanticism, the passage argues that Romanticism is driven by prioritizing the individual. The passage also clearly indicates that Romanticism is in opposition to rules (A) set by higher authorities. The landscape (B) is never mentioned in the passage.

Ngutiphi titatimende letilandzelako letingakhombisi umcondvo lojwayelekile wekuncuma kwetebuchwepheshe? ,"The passage states that common understandings of technological determinism share two ideas:

1.  Technological development follows a ""supracultural"" and ""apolitical"" path.
2.  Technology ultimately has an ""impact"" on societies independent of their relationships.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Imiphumela yebuchwephesha emphakatsini ihambisana nenhlalo (The results of technology in society are aligned with society).** This contradicts the idea that technology's impact is *independent* of social relationships.  Technological determinism suggests technology dictates societal changes, not that they align.

*   **B: Kutfutfukisa kwebuchwephesha akubangwa lusiko (Technological development is not caused by culture).** This aligns with the idea that development follows a ""supracultural"" path.

*   **C: Buchwepheshae bunemiphumela lengekwemvelo emphakatsini (Technology has natural effects on society).** This aligns with the idea that technology has an ""impact"" on societies.

*   **D: Intutfuko yetebuchwepheshe ayisekelwe ngekwentiswa tembusave (Technological development is not based on political action).** This aligns with the idea that development follows an ""apolitical"" path.

Therefore, the statement that does NOT reflect a common idea of technological determinism is **A**.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi lokulandzelako lokungakahlangani nekudonsa umnsalo?","The correct answer is **A: Umsindvo lopholile**. Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""down bow"" starts at the frog (handle) and involves pulling.
*   The passage associates high-pitched sounds with light sound, and low-pitched instruments with strong sound.
*   Option B, C, and D is associated with ""down bow"" as well. Thus, the only option not associated with ""down bow"" is ""umsindvo lopholile""."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi lokulandzelako lokuhlotjaniswa nemsindvo lopholile?","The correct answer is **C: Luphawu lolubukeka njenge V**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Limaki leliyi """"up bow"""" libukeka njenga-V"" (The ""up bow"" marking looks like a V).
*   The passage also states: ""Insimbi yemculo lephakeme ngalokuvamile ikhipha umsindvo lolula"" (Higher-pitched instruments usually produce a lighter sound)

Since the ""up bow"" mark looks like a V, and higher-pitched sounds are lighter, option C is the closest and most correct answer."
Tinsalela tematsambo tikhombisa kutsi tandla tagcina setitayele kusebentiswa ngalokuyinhloko kulokulandzelako?,"The passage states that hominid hands, unlike those of other animals, are no longer used for walking, carrying, or climbing. It also mentions that human hands are shorter than feet. The two- to three-million-year-old hand bone remains show this development away from weight-bearing. This implies that hands became primarily adapted for other purposes. The best fit from the choices is:

*   **A: Kukhwabanisa (Manipulation)**

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Kutfwala sisindvo (Weight-bearing)** - The passage says hominid hands *stopped* being used for weight-bearing.
*   **C: Kuhamba (Walking)** - Same as B.
*   **D: Kuhamba ugucile (Knuckle-walking)** - This is a specific type of walking, which the passage implies hominid hands evolved away from.

So the answer is **A**.

Ukhetsa kususa kuhluka kwelufuto lolusha kuliphi licumbu?,"The correct answer is **D: Kuvetiwe**.

The passage states that selection removes diversity from the ""diversity that is expressed,"" which translates to the ""diversity that is revealed"" or ""diversity that is evident."" In the context of the provided text, ""kuvetiwe"" means ""expressed"" or ""revealed"".
"
Nguyiphi inchubo lenesibopho sekungeta kuhluka kwelufuto?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**C: Kugucuka kwetakhi telufuto**

The passage states: ""Kugucuka kwesimo kungeta kuhlukahlukana kwelufuto..."" which translates to ""Mutation adds variation to heredity...""
"
"Ngekusekelwa elwatini lolusendzimeni, ngikuphi kuloku lokufanele inkawu ikudle kute icatulule “inkinga yemaprotheni”?","The passage states:

*   Plants in the desert do not provide enough amino acids for primates. Failure to get enough amino acids leads to negative consequences.
*   While leafy greens and legumes contain nutrients, they are difficult to digest unless cooked.
*   Animal foods like ants, termites, and eggs are not only easy to digest but also contain complete proteins (all amino acids).

Therefore, the best option for a primate to solve its ""protein problems"" is animal food.

Based on the provided options:

*   C: Intsetse (Ants/Termites) - This aligns with the passage stating that animal foods like ants and termites are easily digestible and contain complete proteins.

The correct answer is **C**.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima,nguyiphi kuletinkinga letilandzelako lengabangela kusweleka kwema-amino acid labalulekile?","The passage states that failure to satisfy amino acid requirements in desert environments leads to ""kucindzeteleka, kungadli kahle, nekufa.""

Of the options given, **B: Kungondleki kahle** (malnutrition) is the most direct consequence mentioned in the passage related to the lack of amino acids. While A, C, and D may be related they are not specifically pointed out as the direct impact of not satisfying amino acids.
So the best answer is **B**.

"ngekwembono lovetiwe kulendzima, yini lengahle yenteke emntfwaneni lohlanganisa nelicembu lelincane lebuhlanga lelicabangwa kutsi lihileleke ekutiphatseni lokuyingoti?","The premise (P) states that children internalize discrimination at a young age, and this impacts their behavior.  Specifically, children who are discriminated against academically based on race perform worse in school after knowing they are being discriminated against.

Given this, if a child from a minority racial group is stereotyped as engaging in risky behavior, the child is *more likely* to engage in that behavior, internalizing the stereotype.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: Umntfwana utoba nemathuba lamaningi kutsi ahileleke ekutiphatseni lokuyingoti** (The child will have more chances to be involved in risky behavior)
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, lwati lemntfwana nemibono yebuhlanga kungaba nemtselela kulokulokulandzelako?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Kutiphatsa kwabo (Their behavior)**.

The passage explicitly states that prejudice impacts ""indlela labatiphatsa ngayo"" (the way they behave). The example given about children underperforming in school after internalizing racial prejudice supports this.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi lokulandzelako lokungeke kuhambisane nekukhuliswa kwemntfwana yemuntfu wesifazane?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Emakhono ekucoca lacinile**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes ""feral children"" as being deprived of normal human interaction. Therefore, they are unlikely to develop strong communication skills.
*   The passage states that feral children demonstrate habits similar to their nonhuman caregivers, such as fear or differentness from people, which fits with traits such as an ""unusual disposition"" (C).
*   The passage also describes that children are left to grow up alone in the wild (A), or the result of not being able to come to terms with a mental or physical disability, which falls under the general idea of ""social concerns"" (D)."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokuchaza ngalokungiko kutiphatsa kwebantfwana?","Based on the passage, the most accurate answer is:

**B: Kutiphatsa lokungakafundziseki kungabangela kusweleka kwebudlelwane**

Here's why:

*   The passage describes ""feral"" children exhibiting behaviors different from typical children due to their isolation. This directly links unusual behavior (unnatural) to a lack of socialization.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Liningi lekutiphatsa lokungakafundziseki kubangwa kukhubateka ngekwemtimba** The passage mentions that some children were hidden due to their parents' inability to accept physical or mental disabilities. While disability *can* be a factor in the initial isolation, the passage implies that the unusual behavior comes from the lack of socialization itself, not directly from the disability.
*   **C: Kutiphatsa lokungakafundziseki kuphela ebantfwaneni labavalelwe batali babo** The passage mentions children hidden by parents but *also* describes children raised by animals or living in the wild alone. So, the unusual behavior isn't exclusive to those hidden by parents.
*   **D: Konkhe kutiphatsa lokungakafundziseki kubangelwa kukhubateka lokukhulu kwengcondvo** The passage doesn't state that *all* unusual behavior is caused by severe mental disability. It is one of the reasons, but not the only one.

"Ngekusho kwalendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokunghambisani netekulima lesiphilisa ngakutiphilisa","The correct answer is **B: Kukhicita kudla lokutsengiselwa labanye**.

Here's why:

The passage defines subsistence farming as farming primarily to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family. Selling food to others implies a commercial purpose, which is the opposite of subsistence farming. The other options align with the description of subsistence farming in the passage: focusing on family needs, using simple techniques, and using locally sourced seeds.
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokuchaza ngalokungiko kulima lotiphilisa ngako?,"Based on the passage provided, the best answer is:

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states, ""Ngekwetemlandvo balimi labaningi bebasebenta ngekulima kwekutiphilisa futsi kusenjalo emaveni lamaningi latfutfukako."" (Historically, many farmers practiced subsistence farming, and it's still the case in many developing countries.)

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: Luhlelo lemvelo ngalokuphelele** (A completely natural system): While subsistence farming tends to be more natural, the passage mentions it's ""vamise kuba ngokwemvelo"" (usually natural), implying it's not *always* completely natural.
*   **B: Isebentisa emasu lahlukile ekukhulisa titjalo** (Uses unique crop-growing techniques): While some specific techniques may be used, this is not the core defining characteristic of subsistence farming. The passage mentions simple methods and seed saving.
*   **C: Ivumela balimi kutsi babelane ngetitjalo tabo kuso sonkhe sifundza sabo** (Allows farmers to share their crops throughout their region): While there might be some sharing in communities practicing subsistence farming, it is not the main goal or a defining feature. The primary purpose is self-sufficiency."
Kuvakashela imnyuziyamu kungaba ngaphasi kwasiphi sigaba setekuvakasha?,"The correct answer is **C: Tekuvakasha kwemasiko**.

The passage states: ""Nangabe umgomo walotsite kuvakashela indzawo letsite kwati umlandvo nemasiko ayo, ngako-ke loluhlobo lwekuvakasha lwatiwa ngekutsi luvakusho lwemasiko."" (If someone's goal is to visit a place to learn its history and culture, then that type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.)

Museums are places where history and culture are preserved and displayed, so visiting a museum falls under the category of cultural tourism.

Here's why:

The passage states that leisure tourism is ""when people go to a place very different from where they live every day to relax and have fun."" This directly translates to taking a break from their daily routine. The other options relate to cultural tourism or sightseeing, not the primary goal of leisure travel as described in the passage.

*   The passage specifically states: ""Tindzaba temphumelelo letinjena tehlisa kwesaba kwenta lushintjo, esikhatsini lesifanako takha tifiso letinhle tekushintja esikhatsini lesitako."" This translates to: ""These kinds of success stories reduce the fear of making changes, at the same time they build good desires to change in the future.""

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **B: Kutfola kuvisisa ebantfwini lababe nemtselela welisiko lenhlangano (Gaining understanding of people who influenced the organization's culture)** While understanding these people is beneficial, it is not explicitly stated to decrease the fear of change. It mainly brings awareness of the organization's history.
*   **C: Kutfola emandla ekushayela enhlangano (Finding the strength to drive the organization)** This might be a *result* of understanding the past and successes, but it's not directly linked to *reducing the fear of change*.
*   **D: Kuvisisa umlandvo wenhlangano (Understanding the history of the organization)** Similar to B, understanding the history provides context, but the *success stories* are the key to lessening the fear of change."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kuvisisa umlandvo wemuntfu kungasita ngani?","Based on the passage, here's the breakdown and why the correct answer is C:

*   **Passage Highlight:** ""Njengoba kucondza umlandvo wemuntfu kungasho kutsi sowucondza lisiko lakhe, kodvwa kuyabasita bantfu kubanikete umcondvo wekutsi bawelaphi kulomlandvo walenhlangano."" (Understanding someone's history might not mean that you understand his/her culture, but it does help people to give them a sense of where they fit in that organization's history).

Let's look at why the other options are not the most direct answer:

*   **A: Kunciphisa kusaba kushintja (Reduce fear of change)** While the passage mentions that success stories reduce the fear of change, this is a separate point, not a direct result of understanding a person's history.
*   **B: Kukhulisa emanani (Increase values)** The passage discusses values but doesn't say that understanding personal history *increases* them.
*   **D: Kwenta kancono kutiphatsa kutemabhizinisi (Improve business behavior)** The passage mentions thinking about business outcomes, but it's not directly linked to understanding someone's history.

**Therefore, the correct answer is C: Kutfola umuzwa wendzawo ngekhatsi kwenhlangano (To get a sense of place within the organization)** This aligns directly with the passage, which states that understanding a person's history helps them understand where they fit within the organization's history and gives them a sense of place."

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes the lack of a single ""right"" way to learn (""Ayikho indlela leyodvwa yekufundza"").
*   It critiques passive learning through television, where knowledge is gained but not applied or experienced directly.
*   It implicitly questions the idea that all learning experiences are equally valuable by highlighting the disconnect between watching and doing (""inchubo lesingeke size siyingenele noma silusebentise lwati lesilitfola kuyo"").

Let's break down why the other options are relevant to content theories:

*   **A: Tifiso letisha letenteka uma sewukhulile:** Content theories often look at how needs and desires evolve over a person's lifespan (as implied by 'uma sewukhulile').

*   **C: Tidzingo tangekhatsi:** These are the core of content theories, which seek to identify fundamental internal needs that drive behavior.

**Understanding popularity (D)**, while it can be a motivating factor, is not the core focus of content theories. It is more related to relationships and social acceptance.

Therefore, **D is the best answer** as it does not represent a focus of content theories."

Now let's look at the options (A, B, C, D) one by one:

*   **A: Kudala sisekelo lapho sihloko singabekwa khona (Creates a framework where the subject can be placed).** This is TRUE. The Rule of Thirds provides guidelines for positioning the subject within the image.

*   **B: Kudala imphilo nemandla phakatsi kwesitfombe (Creates life and energy within the picture).** This is TRUE. Placing elements off-center, as guided by the Rule of Thirds, generally leads to more dynamic and engaging compositions.

*   **C: Kugcina sitfombe sisendzaweni letsite nalesebentako (Keeps the image in a certain place and active).** This is TRUE. The rule of thirds divides the frame into nine parts, and by dividing the image we make the image more active.

*   **D: Kucalisa li-order ngaphakatsi kwesitfombe (Starts order within the image).** This is TRUE. Rule of Thirds helps divide the scene into a more orderly one.

The passage states: ""Loku kubangele kutsi emalensi e-zoom akhicite titfombe letisezingeni lelisetulu naticatsaniswa netitfombe letivamile letiphuma kulamanye emalensi."" This directly translates to zoom lenses producing high-quality images comparable to those from other lenses. This means image quality is improving in zoom lenses so that it is closer to fixed focal length lenses.

"Ngalokusekelwe elwatini lolusendzimeni, kunini lapho I-zoom lensi ingahle ikhetse khona kune-prime lens?","The correct answer is **D: Uma ubuka bumatima lobukhulu lobugcilile**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that zoom lenses have a higher focal complexity than prime lenses. Focal complexity contributes to focal depth. So the information leads to the idea that when observing extreme focal complexity, zoom lenses are more appropriate to use than prime lenses.
*   The passage doesn't mention aperture, size, or using light in dark environments as advantages of zoom lenses over prime lenses.

Therefore, when considering great focal depth, a zoom lens would be preferred."

**A: Kukhona kugcizelela ekubukaneni netimo letinekuthula naletijabulisako tekucaphela** (There is an emphasis on experiencing peaceful and joyful states of consciousness.)

Here's why:

*   While the passage mentions that mystical experiences can bring peace, understanding, joy, or even ecstatic states of being, the **emphasis** of Mysticism is **NOT** solely on seeking *pleasant* states. The focus is on direct, personal experience of ultimate reality/the divine, and that experience can sometimes be challenging or difficult. The passage makes the following statement, ""Bufihlakalo bungahlukaniswa kuletinye tinhlobo tenkholo letikholelwako nekukhulekela ngekugcizelela kwayo kwati kwemuntfu sicu lokucondzile ngenca yalokuhlangenwe nako kwakhe."" This emphasizes that it is the experience that is most important.

Let's examine why the other options *are* accurate:

*   **B: Balandzeli be-mysticism bafuna kucaphela liciniso lelingekwemoya** (Followers of mysticism seek to perceive spiritual truth.): This is a direct restatement of one of the core goals of Mysticism mentioned in the passage, ""Bufihlakalo kusho kufuna kuhlanganisa tingcondvo ngakamoya nalabanye, bunikati nalabanye, noma kwati kwesigcino mbamba, bunkulunkulu, liciniso lakamoya, naNkulunkulu.""
*   **C: Balandzeli bemfihlakalo bangahle batsatse imikhuba letawusita ekukhuliseni kucondza kwabo ngeliciniso lelisetulu** (Followers of Mysticism may take up practices that will aid in growing their understanding of higher truth.): The passage states, ""Balandzeli balwela kuphila ngetindlela letitsite, noma bente imikhuba lehloselwe kuhambisana naleto tindlela.""
*   **D: Kugcizelelwakwekufuna lokuhlangenwe nako lokucondzile esicini semuntfu kucatsaniswa noma ngutiphi letinye tinhlobo tenkholelo yenkholo nekukhulekela** (The emphasis on seeking direct experience in a person's aspect contrasts with any other types of religious belief and worship): The passage states, ""Bufihlakalo bungahlukaniswa kuletinye tinhlobo tenkholo letikholelwako nekukhulekela ngekugcizelela kwayo kwati kwemuntfu sicu lokucondzile ngenca yalokuhlangenwe nako kwakhe, kakhulukati labo labanekuthula, kucondza, injabulo, noma ngisho buntfu lobutfokotako.""

Therefore, the answer is **A**."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo ingcikitsi ye-Mysticism?","The passage states that mysticism emphasizes **direct personal knowledge through individual experience**. Option B, ""Kulandzelela kucondza ngekusebentisa lokwebiwe, sipiliyoni semphakatsi"" (Following understanding using borrowed, communal experience) directly contradicts this. Mysticism is about *personal* experience, not borrowed or communal ones.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Kulandzelela kucondza ngekusebentisa lokwebiwe, sipiliyoni semphakatsi.**
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani lokungenteka kutsi wacala umphakatsi wetekulima?","The correct answer is **C: Bantfu base Maori lababuya ePolynesia**.

The passage states the old belief was that Maori came from Polynesia and ""established an agricultural society"".
"
"Ngakusho kwendzima, licembu lebelitingela ema-moas belibantfu bekucala labahlala kuyiphi indzawo?","The correct answer is **B: E-New Zealand**

The passage states that it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were not the Maori but a group that hunted Moa birds.
"
Kusiphi simo lapho kusebentisa indlela ye-Pureland ye-origami kungazuzisa ifolda?,"The best answer is **D: Umgcoci ukutame kanye noma kabili ngaphambilini**.

Here's why:

*   **The description of the Pureland method emphasizes its simplicity and suitability for beginners or those with limited motor skills.** Options A, B, and C directly contradict this focus.
    *   Option A says the folder chooses to repeat folds at the same time, which is not in line with the method
    *   Option B says the folder has advanced muscle skills, which is opposite of the intent of the method
    *   Option C says the origami requires reverse folds, which are not in the method

**Therefore, Option D is the best choice.**"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungachazi ngalokungiko i-origami yase-Pureland?,"The passage describes Pureland origami as:

*   **Designed for inexperienced folders or those with limited motor skills.**
*   **Having a strict rule of folding one thing at a time.**
*   **Not allowing complex techniques like reverse folds.**
*   **Folding everything forward.**

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Ihloselwe emafoldida lanelwati** (It is intended for experienced folders) - This contradicts the passage, which states it's for inexperienced folders.
*   **B: Indlela iyifaki kugcogca lokubuyela emuva** (The method includes reverse folding) - This contradicts the passage, which states reverse folds are not allowed.
*   **C: Kugcogca kufanele kuba nendzawo lecondze phambili** (Folding must have a forward orientation) - This aligns with the passage, which states all folds are forward.
*   **D: Kuyindlela lenhle yekugcogca lenemakhono lalinganiselwe emoto** (It is a good folding method for limited motor skills) - This aligns with the passage, which states it's helpful for those with limited motor skills.

Both options A and B are incorrect descriptions of Pureland origami based on the provided text. However, the question asks for *one* incorrect description. Option A directly contradicts the target audience (inexperienced folders), while option B contradicts a specific folding technique. Because option A states that it is designed for experienced folders when the passage clearly says that it is for inexperienced folders, it is the incorrect description.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: Ihloselwe emafoldida lanelwati**."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguyiphi indzawo lengakahlangani ne-Indus Valley Civilization?","The correct answer is **C: Tonkhe tifundza enyakatho-mpumalanga Afghanistan**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the civilization included ""some parts of northeastern and northern Afghanistan"". This means it *didn't* encompass *all* of northeastern Afghanistan.
*   The passage explicitly mentions Harappa, the Indus River (from which the civilization got its name), and modern-day Pakistan.
*   Although the Sarasvati river is referenced as potentially more accurate, the passage does not exclude it from being part of the Indus Valley civilization."
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakabalwa njengeligama lekungaba ngilo libe le-Bronze Civilization lecocwe kulendzima?,"The correct answer is **C: yi-Indus River Civilization**.

The passage mentions the following as possible names for the civilization:

*   Indus Valley Civilization
*   Indus-Sarasvati Civilization
*   Harappan Civilization

It does *not* mention ""Indus River Civilization"" as an alternative name.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokuletsa inzuzo yesikhatsi eceleni?","The correct answer is **A: Kuhambisana nalabanye**

The passage states: ""Asetsembe kutsi, bantfu labaningi batobona kutsi lokuncono kakhulu esikhatsini lesidze kusebenta kanyekanye nalabanye."" (Let us hope that many people will see that the best thing in the long run is to work together with others).

This directly links working together (kuhambisana nalabanye) to long-term benefits. The other options describe selfish or short-sighted behaviors that the passage suggests are detrimental in the long run.
"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako umuntfu langahle akubeke phambili uma kugcila kwakhe kusetinzunzweni tanyalo.","The correct answer is **D: Bugovu (Greed)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Umona nebugovu utawuhlale ukhona lentfo yenteka kanje  njalo ngesikhatsi bantfu labanyenti basitakala ngandlelatsite kukhona labatawenta bugovu batfole inzuzo lenkhulu.""  This translates to: ""Greed and selfishness will always exist, and when many people are suffering, there will be those who will be greedy and profit.""

The question (Q) asks what a person *might* prioritize if they are focused on current crises, *according to the passage*.  The passage *directly* links crisis with greedy individuals profiting.

The other options are incorrect because the passage suggests these are alternatives to greed that *should* be embraced for long-term benefit, not what a greedy person would prioritize during a crisis."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani lohlanganise incenye lenkhulu yetindleko tempi?","The correct answer is **D: Bantfu base-Filipino**.

The passage states that ""Bantfu baseFilipino... bebaphocelelekile kutsi babhadalale umtselo we-U.S ngesikhatsi sekucidzetelwa kutsi bakhiphe incenye yetindleko nentalo yetibopho lebetingakabhadalwa egameni lahulumende wasePhilippine ngeWall Street."" This directly indicates that the Filipino people were forced to pay taxes that covered a significant portion of the war costs and debts.
"
Ngusiphi sikhatsi lesafika ngaphambi kweminyaka yema-Templars?,"The correct answer is **C: Kminyaka lesekucaleni nemkhatsi** (Early Middle Ages).

The passage states: ""EmaHigh Middle Ages andvulela emaEarly Middle Ages..."" which translates to ""The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages..."" Therefore, the Early Middle Ages came before the time period of the Templars.
"
Ngusiphi sikhatsi lesafika ngemuva kweminyaka yema-Templars?,"The correct answer is **A: i-Late Middle Ages**.

The passage states that the High Middle Ages were followed by the Late Middle Ages.
"
Nguyiphi indlela yekulapha noma inchubo lekungakhulunywa ngekutsi beyisetjentiswa bodokotela nabodokotela lahlindzako ngesikhatsi sembuso waseRoma?,"The correct answer is **B: Kusebentisa tincaphuto tembewu ye-herbane ye-scoplamine.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Roman doctors/surgeons used scopolamine derived from the seeds of the herbane plant.
*   The text doesn't talk about curing post traumatic stress disorder, stopping blood with arterial clamps, or cutting off body parts."
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakadzalulwa intfutfuko leyentiwe emkhakheni wetekulapha ngesikhatsi sembuso waseRoma?","The correct answer is **C: Kwakhiwa kwetibhedlela tekufundza (Construction of teaching hospitals)**.

The passage mentions the following as developments during the Roman empire:

*   **A: Kwakhiwa kweNhlangano yeTekulapha (Establishment of a Medical Corps):** Stated as the Roman Medical Corps
*   **D: Kucashwa kwabodokotela yiNkhosi (Hiring of doctors by the Emperor):** Stated as Emperor Augustus hiring doctors

The passage does **not** mention the construction of teaching hospitals. Therefore, that is the development not explicitly mentioned. While the medical corps and hiring of doctors could imply some teaching/training, the passage doesn't directly state that teaching hospitals were built. Option B is irrelevant to advances in the medical field.
"
Lincike tukwani likhono lekubona?,"All of the options are correct and contribute to the ability to see. However, **A: Titfo tesimiso yemiva yekubona** and **B: Tidzingo tentfo lephilako** are the most fundamental and comprehensive answers.

Let's break it down:

*   **A: Titfo tesimiso yemiva yekubona (Organs of the visual system)**: This is the most direct answer. The visual system, including the eyes and brain, are essential for sight. The specific structures and components of those organs dictate how well something can see.

*   **B: Tidzingo tentfo lephilako (Needs of the organism)**: This is also a crucial factor. The type of vision an organism needs is directly tied to its environment and lifestyle. A nocturnal animal needs different vision than a diurnal animal. These needs shape the evolution and development of the visual system.

*   **C: Kuvakala kwebudze lobutsite beligagasi (Sensitivity to certain wavelengths)**: The capacity to perceive light wavelengths, which corresponds to colors, has a direct influence on what is observed.

*   **D: Emazinga e-acuity lahlukahlukene (Different levels of acuity)**: Vision clarity has a direct effect on how effectively the thing sees.

So, while C and D are important aspects of vision, they are more specific details. A and B represent the broader and more fundamental dependencies.

**Therefore, the best answer is a combination of A and B, as vision depends on BOTH the structure of the visual organs AND the specific needs of the organism.**"
Kuhluka kwesakhiwo semehlo phakatsi kwetintfo letiphilako kuncike kuphi?,"The best answer is **B: Tidzingo temtimba**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states ""kusukela ekwakhekeni ngendlela leyinkimbinkimbi kuye ngaloko **lokudzingekako kuleyontfo lephilako**"" which translates to ""from being complex to what is **needed by the living thing**"".
*   While wavelength sensitivity and acuity level (C) are *affected* by eye structure, the *reason* for the variation is driven by the organism's requirements.
*   Option A (Wavelength range) is a result of eye differences but not the root cause of why those differences exist.
*   Option D (difficulty of the body) does not make sense.

Therefore, B is the most accurate and direct answer based on the provided text."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngisiphi sitatimende mayelana nesikhatsi lesingayiveti kahle inkholo?","The correct answer is **B: I-guru isici lesibalulekile lesingakavami ku-Sikhism**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bafundzisi basesontweni babantfu labasisekelo labahlonishwako kuto tonkhe tinkholo taseNdiya bodvwa iSikhism ngiyo lebalulekile leyakha umgogodla wetikholelo teSikh."" This directly contradicts the statement that the guru is uncommon to Sikhism.  It says Gurus are fundamental to Sikh beliefs.

Let's look at why the other options are either supported by the passage or are at least plausible interpretations:

* **A: I-Sikhism beyimphumela wekuhlukana kwemahlalo phakatsi kwelisiko lema-Hindu:** The passage mentions that Sikhism originated in a Hindu cultural environment and acknowledges Hindu roots but emphasizes its distinct identity. This implies a separation or differentiation, even if not a complete break.
* **C: Kwalandzela tifundziswa letiyimfica ngemuva kwemsunguli wale nkholo, Guru Nanak:** The passage states, ""Lenkholo yatfolakala ngelikhulu lesi-15 itfolwa ngu-Guru Nanak (1469–1539). Yachubeka ikhona iminyaka leyimfica."" ""Tifundziswa letiyimfica"" refers to the following years. The passage states the religion was around for several years.
* **D: Emasiko latsite eSikhism asekelwe ku-Hinduism:** The passage explicitly says, ""ngisho noma bavuma kutsi isuka emsukeni wemaHindu nasemasikweni awo,"" which translates to ""even though they acknowledge that it comes from Hindu roots and traditions.""
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokubukwa njenge ncenye leyinhloko yesistimu yenkholelo ye-Sikh?","The correct answer is **A: Umcondvo we-Guru**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Bafundzisi basesontweni babantfu labasisekelo labahlonishwako kuto tonkhe tinkholo taseNdiya kodvwa iSikhism ngiyo lebalulekile leyakha umgogodla wetikholelo teSikh."" This directly emphasizes the importance of Gurus (teachers) as central to the Sikh belief system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Emasiko ema-Hindu**: While the passage mentions Sikhism originates from a Hindu cultural context, it also stresses that Sikhs consider their religion distinct. Therefore, Hindu traditions are not viewed as a core part of their belief *system* itself.
*   **C: Kwala kuvuma letinye tinkholo temandiya**: The passage says that Gurus are respected in all Indian religions, which implies respect not rejection.
*   **D: Kukhuluma si-Punjabi**: The passage mentions that Gurmat means ""the way of the Gurus"" in Punjabi but doesn't mean that speaking Punjabi is part of the Sikh belief system."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungani bantfwana labanenkinga yekuswela Kunakwa Lokungentek Kube Matima Kugcila kuyo?","The passage states: ""Bantfwana labane-ADD bakutfola kumantima kugcila etintfweni letifana nemsebenti wesikolwa...""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Umsebenti wesikolo**.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungani bantfwana labanenkinga Yekunaka bavame kutibandzakanya ekutiphatseni lokuyingoti?","The correct answer is **D: Kuvuselela bucopho**.

The passage states: ""Labantfwana bavamisa kungena etinkingeni letinkulu, ngoba *benta tintfo letiyingoti, bayalwa, futsi baphikisane neligunya* **kuze basitwe endleleni labacabanga ngayo, njengoba tingcodvo tabo tingeke tisitwe tindlela letivamile nje**"". This implies that risky behavior is a way for them to stimulate their brains (""tingcodvo tabo"") because ordinary methods don't work. So, ""kuvuselela bucopho"" (to stimulate the brain) is the most accurate answer.
"
"Ngekusekela elwatini lelisendzimeni, ngukuphi kuloku lokungasiso sibonelo sekwenta sikafu?","Based on the passage, the concept of a ""scaffold"" in learning is about providing personalized support and guidance to a learner, much like a teacher would do. This support helps the learner overcome challenges and develop new skills. Virtual Scaffolds within software provide this same type of support.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Sifundvo ekucaleni kwemdlalo wangcondvo mshini** This is the example of what we are looking for. A tutorial at the beginning of a video game often provides guided instructions and support to help the player learn the mechanics and controls of the game, making it a form of scaffolding.

*   **B: Umfundzisi we-SAT** A SAT Tutor provides personalized guidance and support to help students prepare for the SAT exam. This is similar to scaffolding, where the tutor helps the student overcome challenging areas and learn new skills.

*   **C: Luhlelo lekufundza lelitimele** a self-directed program is not an example of what we are looking for.

*   **D: Umceceshi weligi lencane** A Little League coach provides guidance, instruction, and support to young athletes, helping them learn the fundamentals of baseball and improve their skills. This is another example of scaffolding in action.

Therefore, **C: Luhlelo lekufundza lelitimele** is the example that is not the example of scaffolding in the passage."
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungawuchazi kahle umcondvo wekwenta sikafu?,"The correct answer is **C: Kwatiwa nangekutsi kufundza lokusekelwe kumaphrojekthi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that project-based learning is one thing, and scaffolding (virtual scaffolds in this case) is a *tool* used within that process to help students.** It's *not* the same thing. Project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, but the teacher's method of supporting the student is still paramount. The *scaffolds* within software are meant to assist with specific difficult tasks within that learning process.

Let's look at why the other options are likely correct based on the passage:

* **A: Tikafu tingabakhona cishe:** The passage discusses ""Virtual Scaffolds"" within software, implying they exist in a virtual (digital) form. The phrase ""cishe"" could mean ""virtually"" or ""nearly,"" thus making option A plausible.
* **B: Kulusito kakhulu kunendlela yekufundza:** The passage says the *teacher's* support is paramount, but that scaffolding is a *helpful tool*. Option B captures the essence that the support structure (scaffolding) is very beneficial but still a supplementary tool to a core methodology of learning.
* **D: Tikafu tisebentiselwa kuniketa kwesekwa ekucaleni kwesipiliyoni sekufundza:** The passage describes scaffolds as being there to help when a student struggles with something they would have difficulty doing alone. This is frequently, but not exclusively, at the *beginning* of a new learning experience when students encounter difficult new tasks. This makes option D plausible.

Therefore, option C misinterprets the relationship between project-based learning and scaffolding, making it the least accurate.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngusiphi sici seMySpace lesingazuzisa bafundzi labanenkinga yekufundza?","The correct answer is **A: Kwenta ngekufisa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Kungalungiswa kuze kwentiwe kube lula kukufundza futsi kufakwe umbala lotsite ngendlela lokufiswe ngayo."" (It can be customized to make it easier to read and include a specific color as desired.). This directly addresses how customization can help students with reading difficulties.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Emabhulogi**: While blogs are mentioned as a feature, the passage doesn't say how they specifically benefit students with reading difficulties.
*   **C: Likheli lewebhu lelilodvwa**: A simple web address is helpful for memory and typing, but not specifically related to reading difficulties.
*   **D: Emaphrofayili latingidzi letingu-54**: The number of profiles is irrelevant to helping students with reading difficulties."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lobekungasiyo incenye yemphendvulo ya-Krushchev esibhebheni sesisebenti?","The correct answer is **C: Kwandzisa kuncipha kwemholo**.

The passage states that the workers were protesting about the reduction of wages, and Khrushchev allowed certain economic demands and appointed a new Prime Minister but did not increase wage reduction. The other options are mentioned in the passage as part of Khrushchev's response.
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo imbangela yeluthuli ePoland?,"The correct answer is **D: Kukhetfwa kwa-Wladyslaw Gomulka**.

The passage states that the protests, fueled by food shortages and wage cuts, *led* to Gomulka being appointed. Therefore, his appointment was a *result* of the unrest, not a cause. The other options (Communism, food shortages, wage cuts) are all listed in the passage as contributing factors to the unrest.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakatsintsi budlelwane phakatsi kwe-USSR kanye ne-USA?","Based on the passage, the following factors negatively impacted the relationship between the USSR and the USA:

*   **Cultural differences:** ""inchubo nemasiko kwenta kutsi lamave acabane"" (culture and traditions made these countries oppose each other)
*   **Conflicting processes:** ""kwaba khona kungevani, futsi inchubo nemasiko kwenta kutsi lamave acabane"" (there was disagreement, and culture and traditions made these countries oppose each other)

The passage explicitly mentions Germany as a factor that *initially* brought the USSR and USA together (""IJalimane beyisitsa ngeMphi Yelive 2, loko lokwaholela ekubambisaneni kwe-USSR kanye ne-USA.""), but there is no mention in the passage of arguments about plans.

So the correct answer is **D: Tingcabano mayelana netinhlelo** (Arguments about plans)"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungachazi ngalokungiko inhloso yekutfumela imiva emtimbeni wonkhe?,"Impendvulo lelungile ngu **A: Kunciphisa kugeleta kwengati.**

"
Yini lengatfilakala e-The Giza Plateau?,"The correct answer is **B: Emathempheli**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""I-Giza Plateau, nobe i""""Giza Necropolis"""" Endzaweni yalabafile eGibhithe inema-pyramid lamanyentana...emathuna lamancane lamanyentana, **emathempeli lamanyentana**, neSphinz lenkhulu.""

Let's break down why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: Lithuna:** While there are tombs at the Giza Plateau (""emathuna lamancane lamanyentana""), the question is asking what can be *generally* found there. The other options are more comprehensive.
*   **C: Tonkhe timangaliso letidikhombisa:** The passage clearly states that the Great Pyramid of Giza is the *only* of the seven ancient wonders still standing.
*   **D: Iphiramidi lenkhulu:** While the Great Pyramid *is* on the Giza Plateau, the question is again asking what can be *generally* found there. Option B, mathempeli, is included in the things found at the Giza Plateau."
Bekuyini inhloso ye-Phiramidi Lekhulu?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuhlonipha Pharaor**.

The passage states: ""Indvundvuma Lenkhulu ingelenye kuletinyenti letakhiwa kute kuhlonishwe kufa kwaFaro."" (The Great Pyramid is one of many that were built to honor the death of the Pharaoh.) and ""I-pyramid lenkhulu yakhiwelwa kuhlonipha Faro Khufu..."" (The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu...)

Therefore, the primary purpose of the Great Pyramid was to honor the Pharaoh.
"
Ngubani lonesibopho ngelwati letfu lemshiseli lowacekela phasi lithempeli?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngu-Strabo**.

The passage states that the Greek historian Strabo wrote down Herostratus's name, which is how we know it today.
"
Ngukuphi lokunenkhulumo lekungiyo ngalokuphatselane nekwakhiwa kabusha kwelithempeli la-Artemis?,"The correct answer is **B: Yakhiwe kabusha ngemuva kwekuphatsa kwa-Alexander Lomkhulu**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that Alexander offered to rebuild the temple, but his offer was refused.
*   It further states that the temple was rebuilt after Alexander's death in 323 BCE. This means it was rebuilt *after* his reign (or ""after the rule of"" as a broader interpretation of ""emva kwekuphatsa"")."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kwacala nini kutsi luhlobo lolutsite lahamba ngemilente lemibili?","The correct answer is **A: Iminyaka leyitigidzi letisikhombisa leyandlula**.

The passage states: ""nanobe iSahelanthropus kungenteka kutsi yayihamba ngetinyawo letimbili ekucaleni kweminyakeni letigidzi letisikhombisa letindlulile."" This indicates that Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as far back as 7 million years ago.
"
Ngutiphi kuletilwane letivame kuhamba ngetinyawo letimbili?,"The correct answer is **B: Homo Erectus**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Kwekuhamba lokwatiwa kucala bekukuhamba ngetinyawo, bantfu bacala kuhamba ngalokucondzile etigidzini letimbili teminyaka letendlulile ngekuvela kwaHomo Erectus"". This directly says that Homo Erectus were the first known to walk upright.
*   While Australopithecus also walked on two legs, the passage specifies that they ""abahambanga ngalokucondzile ngengemkhuba"" (did not walk completely upright habitually). Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs, but this is mentioned as a possibility (""kungenteka kutsi"").
*   ""Tigcweti te-Bipedal"" isn't a specific species, but a description of capabilities.

Therefore, Homo Erectus is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
Yini lebeyizama kufezwa mabutho etimpi asemantini aseJalimani phakatsi nempi yelive yesibili?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuvimbela iBritain kutsi yamukele bantfu netimphahla.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngesikhatsi lesifanako, emasotja aseJalimane, asebentisa tikejana, bekatama kuvimba siminyaminya.""  This means the German forces were trying to disrupt the flow of traffic/supplies *to* Britain. Therefore, they aimed to prevent Britain from receiving people and goods.
"
Ngalokusekelwe elwatini loluniketwe endzimeni lophumelele kakhulu ngetimpi taselwandle phakatsi nemkhankaso weNyakatho ye-Atlantic?,"The correct answer is **A: Ema-Britain kanye NemaMelika**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Americans were trying to transport people and goods across the Atlantic to help Britain.
*   The passage concludes that if Britain had not been supported, Germany would have been able to defeat Britain. This implies that Britain and the US were successful in this part of the conflict.
*   The passage mentions that the Germans were trying to stop this flow with submarines.
*   Thus, based on the information provided, Britain and the United States were more effective in the North Atlantic campaign."
Kungani belingekho lapho ema-Assyrian acalisa kusebentiswa kwe-Calvary?,"The passage explicitly states that ""Around 1000 B.C., the Assyrians developed the first military cavalry."" Cavalry refers to soldiers fighting on horseback. Therefore the correct answer is **A: Emahhashi**.
"
Tinjani timpi letisebentisa i-Calvary?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngelihhashi** (On Horseback).

The passage explicitly states that ""leligama lelitsi calvary lichaza emasotja labekalwa agibele emahhashini awo"" which translates to ""the word calvary refers to soldiers who fought on horseback"".
"
"Ngekusho kwesicephu, bowungeke suitable sakhamuti sase-Babylonian lesivamile?","The correct answer is **A: Kuletsa imihlantjelo egcekeni lelithempeli**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Lithempeli ngalinye linendzawo yelithempeli levulekile bese kuba kungekhatsi lekungena kuyo umpristi kuphela."" This means there's an open courtyard accessible to the public (like regular Babylonian citizens) and an inner sanctuary only priests could enter. Regular people could bring offerings to the open courtyard.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kuhambela umcimbi ethampelini lekucala:** The passage doesn't mention ""umcimbi ethampelini lekucala"" therefore it is incorrect.
*   **C: Umcimbi logcekeni lelithempeli:** The passage does not describe this as a common activity for regular citizens.
*   **D: Baletsa imihlatjelo endlini lencwele lephakatsi:** The passage specifies that only priests were allowed into the inner sanctuary. So, regular citizens would not bring offerings there."
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lobekuhloselwe bafundisi ngalokukhetsekile?,"The correct answer is **B: Tindzawo taphakatsi letincwele**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that only priests could enter the inner area of the temple (""kungekhatsi lekungena kuyo umpristi kuphela""). This makes B the most specifically priest-related area.
While priests also lead ceremonies and use them in their practices, they are not the only ones involved, making B a better option.

Therefore, the answer is **B: Tindzawo taphakatsi letincwele**"
Inkosi Tutankhamun waluzuza nini ludumo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngemuva kwekutholwa kwelithuna lakhe** (After the discovery of his tomb).

The passage explicitly states that Tutankhamun became famous *after* the discovery of his tomb in 1922.

Yini leyenta Inkosi Tutankhamun waba yinkosi yaseGibhithe leyatiwa kakhulu?,"The correct answer is **A: Kutfolakala kwelithuna lakhe lelingakaphatamiswa** (The discovery of his undisturbed tomb).

The passage explicitly states that his fame arose from the discovery of his nearly intact tomb in 1922. The other options are incorrect based on the information given:

*   **B:** The passage says he was *not* considered important in ancient times and was *not* included in king lists.
*   **C:** The passage indicates the opposite - the tomb was mostly untouched.
*   **D:** The passage indicates the opposite - he wasn't considered important during ancient Egyptian times.
"
Yini imbongi yem-Greek lengu-Homer lengakwati kukwenta?,"The passage states that Homer was a ""blind"" poet. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B: Bona (See)
"
Ngumuphi um-Greek lodvumile lowatiwa ngalokunye ngaphandle kwetincwadzi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngu-Pythagorus**

Here's why:

*   The passage states Pythagoras is known for ""seti setibalo teluhlobo lwe-Pythagoras, watiwa kakhulu nge-theorem ngekuhlobane kwemasayidi e-triangle."" (Pythagorean mathematics, best known for the theorem about the relationship of sides of triangles). This indicates his fame is related to math (specifically the Pythagorean theorem).
*   The passage identifies Homer, Sophocles, and Aristophanes as writers."
Umndeni wema Hebrew usicitsa kuphi sikhatsi sawo lesiningi?,"The correct answer is **C: Egcekeni** (In the yard).

The passage states: ""Kaningi imphilo yemndeni wemaHebheru yentaka ebaleni."" which translates to ""Often the life of the Hebrew family took place in the yard.""
"
Yini lebeyingakabaluleki kakhulu emndenini wema Hebrew?,"Based on the passage, ""Endzaweni leshisako yaseMphumalanga Lesekhatsi, indlu bekungasiyo intfo lebaluleke kangako"" which translates to ""In the hot Middle Eastern environment, the house was not that important.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

C: Imiti yabo (Their houses)
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakachazwa njengemehluko phakatsi kwemave Scandinavian?,"The correct answer is **B: Lendzawo (Location)**.

The passage explicitly mentions differences in people (bantfu), kings (emakhosi), customs (imihambo), and history (mlandvo). It doesn't discuss geographical differences, thus location is the unmentioned distinction.
"
Ngubani lowahlala e-Greenland kucala?,"The correct answer is **A: Tive tema-Eskimo**.

The passage states, ""Kepha ngale kwetintfo latitfolile, sive sema-Eskimo besesivele siphila lapho ngaleso sikhatsi,"" meaning ""But besides what he found, the Eskimo people were already living there at that time."" This clearly indicates that the Eskimo people were there *before* Erik the Red and presumably before any other Europeans.
"
Nguliphi licembu lelingatsandza kudla ngaphandle kwetihlalo?,"The correct answer is **C: Emadvodza aseRoma lacebile**.

The passage states that the wealthy Romans liked to recline and lean on their elbows while eating.
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lobekungeke kube yincenye yemkhosi wemaRoma asendvulo?,"The correct answer is **D: Sitja selikalikhuni lelosiwe**.

The passage states clearly that no one in ancient Rome ever tasted turkey. The other options are mentioned (or implied) in the passage: poor guests sitting on stools, snails as food, and rich men reclining while eating.
"
"Ngalokusekelwe endzimeni, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungenteka kube nemtselela lohlala njalo?","Based on the passage, the answer is **D: Lisiko lemphucuko**.

Here's why:

*   The passage defines *imphucuko* as a shared culture of a large group of people living and working together.
*   It mentions that smaller cultural practices ( *imicikilisho lemincane yemasiko*) can disappear as the world evolves.
*   *Tindzawo-letitimele* (isolated regions) are described as being the first to disappear.
*   *Umphakatsi* (community) is too broad; *sifundza lesitimele* (isolated region) is likely to disappear.
*   This implies that the culture associated with *imphucuko* (civilization/major culture) is more likely to have a lasting impact because it's widely shared and deeply ingrained."
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, yini leyandvulela sive?","The answer is **C: Sifundza lesitimele**.

The passage states: ""Tindzawo-letitimele ngito letingetekucala eliveni."" This translates to ""Self-sufficient regions are what precede a nation.""
"
Ngusiphi sitatimende lesingasilo liciniso mayelana ne-Drukgyal Dzong?,"The incorrect statement is **A: Yakhelwe kugubha kuncoba kwemabutfo aseTibetan-Mongol**.

The passage states that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress to commemorate his victory *against* the Tibetan-Mongol forces, not to celebrate their victory.
"
Ngusiphi sitatimende lesichaza ngalokungiko umphumela wemlilo Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Intfo lesele bekumfanekiso waZhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.**

The passage states that ""nga-1951, umlilo wabangela kutsi kusale tinsalela kuphela taseDrukgyal Dzong, njengalesitfombe saZhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal."" This directly supports option A.
"
Ngusiphi sitatimende lesilandzelako lesiliciniso mayelana ne-Cambodia?,"The correct answer is **D: Bantfu baseThailand babhubhise iPhnom Phen**.

The passage states: ""Base-Thai bangena eCambodia tikhatsi letinyenti ngelikhulu lesi-18 futsi nga-1772 babhubhisa iPhnom Phen."" This directly supports option D.
"
Ngutiphi titatmende letilandzelako letichaza ngalokungiko kuhlaselwa kwe-Cambodia?,"The correct answer is **D: Bantfu baseThailand bahlasele iCambodia kaningi**.

Here's why:

*   **A: I-Vietnam ihlasele iCambodia kaningi** - The text states that the Vietnamese entered Cambodia in the *last years* of the 18th century, but it does not indicate repeated attacks.

*   **B: Bantfu baseThailand kanye nebaseVietnam bahlasele iCambodia ngo 1772** - The text only states that the Thai people destroyed Phnom Phen in 1772. The Vietnamese did not enter Cambodia until the later years of the 18th century.

*   **C: EmaVietnames abhubhise Phnom Phen** - The text specifies that the Thai destroyed Phnom Phen in 1772.

*   **D: Bantfu baseThailand bahlasele iCambodia kaningi** - The text supports this by stating that the Thai entered Cambodia ""tiktikatsi letinyenti"" (many times) in the 18th century."
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lengakakhoni kukwenta ngesikhatsi ise-Taiwan I-Dutch East India Company?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngekutimisela kuyekela kulawula iTaiwan ebukhosini baka-Qing**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Banesizindza encenyeni leseningizimu-ntshonalanga yesichingi** - The passage states that the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan.
*   **B: Kutijwayeta kukhicita lokusanhlavu kwemdzabu** - The passage says the Dutch East India Company changed indigenous methods of agricultural production.
*   **C: Casha tisebenti taseChina emasimini ayo** - The passage mentions the Dutch East India Company hired Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar fields.
*   **D: Ngekutimisela kuyekela kulawula iTaiwan ebukhosini baka-Qing** - The Dutch East India Company controlled Taiwan long before the Qing Dynasty took over. The Qing Dynasty took control in 1683. Therefore, they didn't willingly give control to the Qing Dynasty."
Yini leyasungulwa sivumelwano sase-Shimonoseki?,"The correct answer is **D: Ligunya lase-Japan ngetulu kwe-Taiwan**.

The passage states that the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War, and in this treaty, they ceded control of Taiwan to Japan.
"
Likalwa njani lizinga lekhemikhali I-pH?,"The correct answer is **C: Linani lema-ions Hydrogen kukhemikhali**

The passage states: ""Lizinga le-pH livetwa linani le-Hydrogen (H ku-pH) ions kumakhemikhali lahloliwe.""
"
Yini leyasuswa kuma-ions Hydrogen?,"The correct answer is **D: Ema-Electron**.

The passage states: ""Emahydrogen ions ngemaprothoni lasuswe ema-elekthroni awo"".  This clearly indicates that electrons are removed from hydrogen ions.
"
Ngutiphi kuletinkhulumo letilandzelako letingakuchazi kahle kutidla kwemabhubesi?,"The statement that is NOT an accurate description of lion prides based on the provided text is:

**C: Labadvuna nabesifazane bonkhe bahlobene dvute** (The males and females are all closely related).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the *females* within a pride have close relationships, acting like a large family of sisters and daughters.
*   It *doesn't* explicitly say that the *males* are closely related to the females. In fact, male lions sometimes leave their birth prides and compete to take over other prides, meaning the males in a pride might not be related to the females.

The other options *are* supported by the text:

*   **A: Titiphatsa ngendlela lefana nemaphaketi etinja** (They behave similarly to packs of dogs): The passage directly compares lion pride hunting behavior to that of wolves or dogs.
*   **B: Silinganiso salomdvuna nawesifazane asilingani** (The ratio of males to females is unequal): The passage states there are typically 3 males compared to 30 females.
*   **D: Totibili tiyabulala futsi tiyahlalisana** (Both kill and live together): The passage mentions they hunt and kill, and that they live together in prides."
Ngutiphi tinkhulumo kuleti letilandzelako letingakuchazi kahle kutiphatsa kwemabhubesi?,"The correct answer is **D: Kutiphatsa kwawo kuyafana nalamanye emakati lamakhulu**. Here's why:

*   **P says** ""Licembu lemabhubesi lenta njengelicembu letimphisi, noma tinja, tilwane leticishe tifane nemabhubesi (kodvwa hhayi emakati lamakhulu) ngekutiphatsa..."".

* **P mentions** emadvodza lamatsatfu, nakacatsaniswa nebafati labangemashumi lamatsatfu, which means amaduna ayemahlanu kakhulu kunamabhubesi lamasikati

*   **A is correct:** ""Abantfu kakhulu emphakatsini"" since P states that lions live in prides
*   **B is correct:** ""Indlela latiphatsa nagyo iyefana neyetimphisi"" since P directly compares their behaviour to that of wolves.
*   **C is incorrect:** ""Kokubili lamadvuna nawesifazane kuyingoti kakhulu etilwaneni"", the passage does say that lions hunt.

Therefore, D is the statement that the passage does *not* support, and is the answer."
Bonogwaja basisulu lesivamile saluphi luhlobo letilwane letiyingelako?,"The correct answer is **B: Likati lelikhulu**.

The passage states that large cats eat animals that are medium in size such as rabbits.
"
Emakati lamancane ngalokuvamile atingela kuphi kulokulandzelako?,"The passage states that ""emakati lamanyenti lamancane (lokufaka ekhatsi emakati lafuywako latihambelako) ladla tilwane letincane njengetilokatana, emagundvwane, imigololo, netinyoni.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Emagundvwane**.
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo incenye yendlela yekutingela ema-ocelot?,"The correct answer is **D: Kutingela kuphela tilwane letinesayizi lencane.**

Here's why:

*   **A: Kubhaca endzaweni letitungetile (Hiding in their surroundings):** The passage states: ""Tilwane letibitwa ngekutsi ngema-ocelots titingela inyamatane ngekutsi tibhace ngaloko lokutitungeletile..."" (Ocelots hunt prey by hiding in their surroundings).

*   **B: Kulandzela liphunga lenyamatane yabo (Following the scent of their prey):** The passage says: ""Bososayensi batsi emakati esiganga alandzela tilwane atibambe kuze atidle...ngekutsi ative ngeliphunga..."" (Scientists say ocelots track and catch animals to eat by using their sense of smell).

*   **C: Kulandzela inyamatane yabo ebusuku (Following their prey at night):** The passage states: ""Tingabona kahle ebumnyameni ngembono wasebusuku, bese tiyanyenya"" (They can see well in the dark with night vision and then sneak).

*   **D: Kutingela kuphela tilwane letinesayizi lencane (Only hunting small animals):** While the passage says that ocelots hunt small animals, it doesn't say they *only* hunt small animals. It says ""Cishe tonkhe letilwane ema-ocelot lakatitingelako tincane kakhulu kunawo"" (Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than them) implying that they may hunt other animals as well.

Therefore, option D is the one that is NOT explicitly stated as part of the ocelot hunting strategy in the passage."
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungachazi kahle i-ocelot? ,"The correct answer is **C: Imiva yato yekunuka ibutsakatsaka**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Bososayensi batsi emakati esiganga alandzela tilwane atibambe kuze atidle (tinyamatane letitingelwako) ngekutsi ative ngeliphunga, anukise kuze eve kutsi betikuphi."" This clearly indicates that ocelots have a strong sense of smell, not a weak one.

The other options are all supported by the text:

*   **A: Tikhona kutingela kahle ebusuku:** The passage mentions they have night vision (""Tingabona kahle ebumnyameni ngembono wasebusuku"").
*   **B: Tinyakata ngalokuthulile:** The passage says, ""bese tiyanyenya"" meaning they sneak/stalk.
*   **D: Tikhetsa kutingela tilwane letincane:** The passage says, ""Ema-ocelots atsandza kudla tilwane letincane."" and ""Cishe tonkhe letilwane ema-ocelot lakatitingelako tincane kakhulu kunawo.""
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungeke kubukwe njengemandla lamakhulu engwe?,"The correct answer is **A: Kubhodla**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that although a tiger (lihlosi) *can* roar, its roar isn't as powerful as a lion's roar. Therefore, roaring wouldn't be considered a *major* strength of a tiger compared to the others.
*   The passage directly mentions the tiger's running ability, swimming ability, and strength in pulling (five times its own weight)."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngumuphi umehluko phakatsi kwetingwe nemabhubesi?","The correct answer is **B: Umsindvo wekubhodla kwato**.

The passage states: ""Indlela lihlosi lelibhodla ngayo ayifanani naleyo lephakeme libhubesi lelibhodla ngayo..."" (The way a tiger roars is not the same as the majestic roar of a lion...). This directly highlights a difference in the sound of their roars.
"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, Robert Hooke wentani ngaphambi kwaletinye tati tetintfo letiphilako?","The correct answer is **A: Caphela ema-cell afile** (Observed dead cells).

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Bekangumuntfu wekucala lowabona emangcamuzana lafile."" (He was the first person to see dead cells.)

While the other options are related to the passage and cells in general, Robert Hooke is specifically credited with being the first to observe dead cells.
"
Shano kutsi imvelaphi yeligama lelitsi “cell” isho kutsini?,"The passage states: ""Ingcamuza ligama lesitsatselwa kwelesiLathini lelitsi cella lelisho likamelo lelincane.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Likamelo lelincane**.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, tilwane letiningi tinelukhono lekwentani?","The passage states: ""Tilwane letinyenti tiyakhona kuhamba."" which translates to ""Many animals are able to walk/move.""

Out of the choices, ""Nyakata"" (Move) is the closest synonym for ""kuhamba"" (walk).

Therefore the answer is **B: Nyakata**
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngutiphi tilwane letingena?","The correct answer is **C: Bucopho**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Tilwane kuphela letinetingcondvo (nomanje kungasito tonkhe tilwane letinayo...)."" This means brains are something *only* animals possess (even if not all animals have them). The other options describe characteristics animals *share* with other life forms or that are common but not unique to animals.
"
Yini lesita titjalo enchubeni ye-photosynthesis?,"The correct answer is **D: Lilanga** (Sun).

The passage states: ""Tihlahla tenta kudla kwato ngekusitwa lilanga ngenchubo lebitwa ngekutsi yi-photoynthesis."" which translates to ""Trees make their food with the help of the sun in a process called photosynthesis.""
"
Yini lena bantfu labayikhiphako ihogelwe tigjalo?,"The correct answer is **D: Umoya longcolile**.

The passage states that trees take in carbon-dioxide, which is described as ""lokhishwa bantfu"" (what is released by people) and is also referred to as ""umoya longcolile"" (polluted air).
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngisiphi kuletibonelo letilandzelako lesingatsiya inchubo yekutiphendvukela kwemvelo?","The correct answer is **D: Sibalo sinye sigcine senta lababili**

Here's why:

*   The passage describes speciation, which is the process where one population diverges into two distinct populations that can no longer interbreed. This aligns directly with option D.
*   Options A, B, and C describe single steps/instances in a population's existence. While these steps could result in speciation over a long period, they do not fully describe the evolutionary process of speciation."
Ngusiphi sitatimende lesilandzelako lesingachazi kahle inchubo ye-speciation? ,"Impendvulo lenembile ngu **A: Kwenteka lapho linani lebantfu labasha lingakwati kuvumelana netimo.**

Lokulandzelako kungumcabo walokutsi kungani kunjalo:

*   **I-speciation** ayenteki ngobe kuphela linani lebantfu lingakwati kuvumelana netimo. Entsebentini, iyenteka ngoba linani lebantfu **livumela** etimeni letingacacile letihlukile etimeni lokuqala lelivela kuko. Lokuvumela ngemvelo yilo lolukhokha ekuciniseni kweluhlobo, ngalokutalako kubukeka ngcono ngemvelo lehluke.

*   Letinye tindlela leti-3 ngulesinembile ngaphandle kwelichazelo leteksthi lecinisekisa ngalokucacile: i-speciation yincenye lebalulekile yekutiphendvukela kwemvelo, kubhekiswe ekwakhiweni kwetinhlobo letinsha, futsi ayinakugwemeka."
Nguyiphi incenye yesimiso sekujikeleta kwengati leletsa ingati enhlitiyweni?,"The correct answer is **D: Imitsambo**.

The passage states: ""...ingati isuka enhlitiyweni ngemitsambo yengati letibitwa ngekutsi ema-arteries bese ibuyela emuva enhlitiyweni ngemitsambo yengati lebitwa ngekutsi ema-veins.""  This directly tells us that veins (imitsambo) bring blood back to the heart.
"
Nguwaphi emashubhu lamancane kakhulu ehlelweni lekujikeleta kwengati?,"The correct answer is **A: Ema-Capillary**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Imitsambo yengati lemincane ibitwa ngekutsi ema-capillaries."" (The small blood vessels are called capillaries.)
"
Lukhono letinambutane lekugoba emaphiko ayo emuva ikhulisa ngukuphi lokulandzelako?,"The passage states: ""Letiningi tinambutane tinenzuzo yekuvala emaphiko ato emtimbeni wato. Loku kubaniketa indzawo levulekile lenetindzawana letincane tekubhacela bahlaseli.""

This clearly indicates that folding wings provides more space and fewer places for attackers to grab them, which is related to hiding/evading predators.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: Indzawo yekubhaca**
"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakashiwo endzimeni njengetfo likhono lekuphapha kwetinambutane?,"Impendvulo lengiyo ngu **B: Budze bemphilo**

Incwadzi ichaza kutsi likhono lekutindiza lisita tinambutane nge:
*   Kubalekela titsa
*   Kutfola kudla
*   Kukhiqiza kabusha (kukhwelana kahle)

Incwadzi ayisho lutfo ngendlela likhono lekutindiza lelingatsintsa ngayo budze bemphilo wetinambutane."
Nguyiphi tici letilandzelako letingakavami kusebentiswa nema-dinosaurs?,"The correct answer is **B: Tinsiba**

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that many people don't think of birds as dinosaurs because they have feathers (""anensiba futsi ayandiza""). This implies that feathers are not a commonly associated trait with dinosaurs in people's minds.
*   The passage lists laying eggs (""titalela emacadza"") and walking on hind legs (""tihamba ngetinyawo tato tangemuva njenge-T-Rex"") and having feet with scales and claws (""tinetinyawo letinetincwencwe leticinile netidladla"") as traits that birds share with dinosaurs. Therefore, these are traits that *are* commonly associated with dinosaurs."
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakavami kubukwa njengesici lesabiwe setinyoni nema-dinosaurs?,"The correct answer is **C: Likhono lekundiza**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions that many people don't think of birds as dinosaurs because they have feathers *and* fly. This implies that the ability to fly is a characteristic that sets them apart in people's minds.

The other options are mentioned in the passage as characteristics shared between birds and dinosaurs:

*   A: Kubeka macandza (laying eggs)
*   B: Kusebentisa tinyawo letimbili tasemuva kuhamba (walking on two hind legs)
*   D: Tinyawo ngetindzipho (feet with claws)"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguyiphi incenye yesitjalo se-cycad lokungenteka idle i-Triceratops?","The correct answer is **A: Emacembe enaso**.

The passage states: ""I-Triceratops kungenteka isebentise umlomo wayo lonemandla kukhipha emacembe ngembi kwekudla umtimba wesihlahla."" This directly indicates that Triceratops likely consumed the leaves of cycads.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi lokulandzelako lokungenteka kutsi i-Triceratops idle? ","The correct answer is **B: Sitselo lesinemagaja lacinile**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions the possibility of Triceratops eating cycads, which are described as plants with tough fronds and prickly leaves. This fits the description of ""sitselo lesinemagaja lacinile""
*   The passage does not mention anything about whales, which rules out option A.
*   The passage mentions that polli can eat poisonous plants, but it doesn't state that triceratops ate polli. This eliminates option C.
*   The passage does not mention plants with soft fruits, which rules out option D."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kulemidlalo lelandzelako lekungenteka idume kakhulu etindzaweni letisenyakatho ye-Italy?","The correct answer is **C: Kugibela emabhodi esithwathweni**.

The passage states that ""Imidlalo yasebusika idvumile etigodzini taseNyakatfo,"" which translates to ""Winter sports are popular in the Northern regions."" Kugibela emabhodi esithwathweni (Snowboarding) is a winter sport, while the other options are not specifically associated with winter or Northern Italy in the passage.
"
"Ngalokusekelwe elwatini loluniketwe endzimeni, ngumuphi kulemidlalo lelandzelako lowawina umcudzelwano wemhlaba wase-Italy?","The passage states: ""leli laseTaliyane laba boshampeni bemcudzelwano Wendzebe Yemhlaba nga-2006"" which translates to ""the Italian team became the world cup champions in 2006"". World Cup refers to soccer/football.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Ibhola yetinyawo (Football)**
"
Ngemuva kwasiphi sentakalo tincenye letitsite tase-Luxembourg taba I Belgium?,"The correct answer is **B: Kugucuka Kwebantfu Base-Belgiam**

The passage states: ""Tincenye tamanje teBelgium betiyincenye yeLuxembourg esikhatsini lesendlulile kodvwa tabese tiba yiBelgian ngemuva kwa-1830 ngemuva Kwetingucuko taseBelgian.""  This directly answers the question.
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokutsintse kungatsatsi luhlangotsi kwe-Luxembourg?,"The correct answer is **A: Umsebenti wase-German.**

The text states that Luxembourg tried to remain neutral but was occupied by Germany during both World War I and World War II. This occupation directly impacted its ability to remain neutral.
"
Mangaki emakhilomitha Sikwele endzawo yonkhe yase-Turkey e-Europe?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**

The passage states: ""Indzawo yaseTurkey, kufaka ekhatsi emachibi, ivala 783,562 wema-square khilomitha (300,948 sq mi), ema-square khilomitha langu 755,688 (291,773 sq mi) angaseningizimu nenshonalanga ye-Asia bese nema-square khilomitha langu-23,764 (9,174 sq mi) eYurophu.""
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, cishe imakhilomitha lamangaki i-Turkey?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**

The passage states: ""Indzawo yaseTurkey ingetulu ngemakhilomitha langu-1,600 (1,000 mi) budze futsi ibe ngu-800 km (500 mi) bubanti..."" which translates to: ""The land area of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide...""
"
Lusetjentiswela ini lulwimi lwesi-Latini e-Vetican City?,"The correct answer is **A: Imicimbi yenkholo**.

The passage states that ""SiLatin sivame kusetjentiswa emibutsanweni yetenkholo."" (Latin is often used in religious gatherings).
"
"Edolobheni lase-Vatican, indzaba si-Italian singasebentiswa sona?","The correct answer is **D: Kuchumana wonkhe malanga**.

The passage states: ""SiTaliyane siphindze sibe lulwimi lolusetjentiswa onkhe malanga ngulabo labasebenta khona...""
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokuzuzisako ngekucuba umsindvo wabongcondvomshini labasezingeni lelisetulu?","The correct answer is **A: Umculo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Umculo utfebulwa kusetjentiswa bongcondvomshini labayinkimbinkimbi kwenta nekuhlanganisa imisindvo kanyekanye"" which translates to ""Music is processed using sophisticated computers to create and mix sounds simultaneously."" This directly links sophisticated computers to music production.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, miningi lemiti lekuyiphi indzawo lenemathoyilethi lashaywako?","The passage states that the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with water flushing in almost every house. So the answer is A.
"

*   China

So the answer is A, B, C and D."
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokubangela kutsi loshwibako ajike?,"The correct answer is **A: Lijika lelincane ngaphasi kwensingo yesketi**.

The passage states that ""Ngenca yekutsi ngaphansi lolusingo lutjekile kancane...lesiphetfo sawo lesitsintsa lelichwa naso siyagobeka. Loku kubangela kutsi lamasodvo ahambe."" This clearly indicates that the slight curve/tilt under the skate blade is what causes the wheels (amasodvo) to move, and therefore the skater to turn.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokuchaza ngalokungiko imbobo yensimbi yesimanje yekushibilika esithwathweni?","Based on the passage, the most accurate description of the modern ice skate blade is **B: Kugobekile (Curved)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Njengoba lolusingo lugucuka kusuka kulolunye luhlangotsi kuya kulololunye, lesiphetfo sawo lesitsintsa lelichwa naso **siyagobeka**."" This translates to: ""As the blade turns from one side to the other, the part that touches the ice also **curves**.""

The other options are either not the primary description or not directly tied to the core functionality explained:

*   A: Lokukabili (Double): The passage mentions two edges but the *curvature* is what enables turning.
*   C: Umgede (Groove): While there might be a slight concavity, the passage doesn't emphasize a groove as the defining feature.
*   D: Kutjekile (Tilted): The underside is tilted to aid movement, but again, the curve facilitates the turning action as described.

Therefore, the answer is **B**."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguyiphi inchubo levumela ema-athomu kutsi asuse emandla langetulu kwemandla ekukhanya?","The correct answer is **D: Kukhishwa kwemisebe levuselelwe**

The passage states: ""Bososayensi babita lenchubo ngekutsi """"kuphuma lokukhutsatako kwemisebe"""" ngoba lama-atom akhishwa ngulokukhanya, bese sekabangela kutsi kuphume lemisebe yekukhanya.""

This directly translates to: ""Scientists call this process """"stimulated emission of radiation"""" because these atoms are emitted by light, and then cause the emission of light radiation.""

Therefore, the process that allows atoms to release excess light energy is stimulated emission of radiation (Kukhishwa kwemisebe levuselelwe).
"
Yini leyenta i-atom ikhiphe i-photon?,"The passage states, ""Kuze abuyele akhanye ngelizinga lebekakhanya ngalo ngaphambili kufanele alahle emandla lengetiwe lawatfole kulokukhanya. Bakwenta loku ngekukhipha kukhanya lokuncane lokubitwa ngekutsi """"yi-photon"""". ""

This translates to: ""In order to return to shining at the level it shone previously, it must discard the extra energy it gained from the light. It does this by emitting a small light called a photon.""

Therefore, the atom emits a photon to **shed extra energy**. This aligns best with option A, but needs rephrasing. Options B and D are incorrect and the closest answer is C.

The passage implies this occurs because the atom is in a higher, unstable energy level. It wants to return to a lower, more stable state.
So the most appropriate answer is:
**C: Emazinga emandla langakazinzi (Unstable energy levels)**
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini letawugcina ibanga kutsi sibani siyekele kusebenta?","The correct answer is **C: Mucu lophakatsi kwesibani uyasha**.

The passage states, ""Ngemuva kwema-awa lamanyenti alungisa intsambo elambini ngekuhamba kwesikhatsi lelilambu lishile futsi langasasebenti."" This translates to ""After many hours of fixing the lamp's cord, eventually the bulb burned out and stopped working."" The phrase ""burned out"" implies that the filament inside the bulb broke.
"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungaba yingoti kukutsintsa uma ushintja sibani?,"The correct answer is **C: Sisekelo sesibani** (Sisekelo sesibani).

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically warns about the danger of touching the metal part inside the socket (sisekelo sesibani) where the bulb sits while the power is on. The passage explains that the electricity in the light socket can electrify you if you touch the inside of the socket or the metal part where the bulb sits while the bulb is in.
*   The other options are not as directly related to the immediate electrical hazard described in the passage."
"Ngekusho kwesicephu, kwentekani uma i-nucleus ihlukana?","The correct answer is **B: Emandla ayakhululwa**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...Kuhlukanisa inyukliya futsi bese ikhipha emanye alawo mandla."" This directly indicates that energy is released when the nucleus splits (fissions).
"

The passage states: ""Kudzingeka irokhethi lengemafidi langetulu kwalangu-100 kuphakama kuze ufake isethelayithi noma sibonakudze."" This directly says that rockets are needed to put a telescope into space.
"
Lokufanele kucaphelwe ngemcimbi lojikeletako kute kulandzelwe kuhamba kwesikhatsi?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **A: Budze besikhatsi (Duration)**.

Here's why:

* The passage mentions that time is ""indlela lesicatsanisa ngayo budze betehlakalo (the way we compare the duration of events).""
* The passage also states that you can ""tihambisela sikhatsi ngekwakho ngekutsi ubuke kuphindzaphindzeka kwetentakalo letingumjikeleto (orient yourself in time by observing the repetition of cyclical events)."" This implies that the length of those cycles is what helps us track time.

The other options are not directly relevant to tracking time based on cyclical events as described in the passage.
"
"Ngekusho kwesicephu, ngusiphi sici sesigameko lesisebentiswa sikhatsi kucatsanisa?","The correct answer is **A: Budze**.

The passage states: ""Sikhatsi futsi siyindlela lesicatsanisa ngayo budze betehlakalo."" which translates to: ""Time is also the way we compare the length of events.""
"
"Ngekusho kwesicephu, ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokubukwa njengalokutayelekile njengendlalifa yesihlalo sebukhosi?","Impendvulo lelungele yona ngu: **B: Kuyekela inyuvesi kute ujoyine emasotja**

Lulwimi lase-Estonia lacalwa yini?,"The correct answer is **C: Tindlela taseJalimani**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that western Estonia was under the influence of German culture in the 15th century.
* It further explains that some devout Germans wanted to bring God closer to the native people.
* To do this, they started the Estonian language using German words, adding the letter ""Õ/õ"".
* This suggests the creation of the language was influenced by **German ways (Tindlela taseJalimani)**, including language and religious practices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umlingisi Õ/õ:** The letter Õ/õ was *added* to the language, it didn't start the language itself.
*   **B: I-alfabethi yaseJalimani:** The passage states the language took seeds of German vocabulary but doesn't say the whole German alphabet was used.
*   **D: Nkulunkulu:** While the passage says the Germans wanted to bring God closer to the native people, God was not the thing that the language was started by.
"

The passage states: ""Linani lalabakhuluma lulwimi lwalendzawo luyehlukana kushiyane ngekutsi labahlobene kakhulu bayabalwa yini noma cha.""  This directly says the number of native Hindi speakers changes depending on whether closely related languages are included in the count.
"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokusitatimende lesiliciniso mayelana netilwimi i-Hindi kanye ne-Urdu?,"The correct answer is **B: Tiyahluka ngembhalo**.

The passage states: ""SiHindi nesiUrdu kusebentisa emagama lafanako kepha kuhlukile ngekubhala phansi"". This directly supports option B.
"
Ngikuphi lokulandzelako lokungasilo liciniso lekungilo mayelana nema-alfabethi eHangeul?,"The correct answer is **A: Yasungulwa ekucaleni kwekubusa kweNkosi Sejong**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Hangeul was invented around 1444, during King Sejong's reign (1418-1450). 1444 is towards the **middle** of his reign, not the beginning.
*   Option B is incorrect because the original name of the alphabet was Hunmin Jeongeum, not Hunan Jeongeum
*   Option C is true because it states that the alphabet was created by the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty which is true.
*   Option D is true because it states that the alphabet was invented on purpose which is a true statement."
I-alfabethi Hunmin Jeongeum igcine ishintjwe yaba yini?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Hangeul**.

The passage states that King Sejong officially named the alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum, which later became known as Hangeul.

Ngekusho kwalendzima ngutiphi tilwimi letitfonye si-Sanskrit,"The correct answer is **D: Tilwimi tase-India**.

The passage states: ""Luwimini lwe-Sanskrit akusilo lulwimi lolulula futsi lunotsile, futsi lubonakele lungumtfombo wetilwimi letinyenti taseNdiya..."" which directly indicates that Sanskrit is a source of many languages in India.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kusebentiswa kwe-Sanskrit kwancipha ngenca yani?","The correct answer is **D: Kubusa (Ruling)**.

The passage states: ""Emvakwekuhlanganiswa kwe-Upanishads, iSanskrit yanyamalala nje ngenca yalabaphetse."" This translates to ""After the compilation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit disappeared simply because of those in power/rulers.""
"
Ngekusho kwendzima ngikuphi kwesitatimende lekungiso mayelana nemandla ladvonsela ku-lo?,"The correct answer is **A: Emandla ladvonsela phasi angadvonsa kancane kuwe kunemandla a-lo ladvonsela phasi.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that you weigh less on the moon than on Earth. This is because the moon's gravity pulls on you less strongly than Earth's gravity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mandla a-lo ladvonsela phasi advonsa kakhulu, kungako ungenta kancane** - This contradicts the passage. You weigh *less* on the moon.
* **C: Mandla a-lo ladvonsela phasi advonsa kakhulu,kungako usindza kakhulu**-This contradicts the passage. You weigh *less* on the moon
* **D: Emandla ladvonsela phasi angadvonsa kakhulu kuwe kunemandla a-lo ladvonsela phasi** -  This is true, but it refers to Earth's gravity versus the moon's. The question asks specifically about the moon's gravity.
"
Ngekusho kwendzima ngutiphi taletilandzelako titatimende letichaza ngalokungiko luhla lweNyanga lwangaphandle?,"Let's analyze the statements based on the provided text:

*   **P: Indzawo lengetulu eNyangeni yakhiwe ngematje nangelutfuli. Indzawo lengaphandle lweNyanga ibitwa ngekutsi lucwecwe lolungetulu. Lencenye yenyeti lebitwa ngekutsi yi-crust ingemakhilomitha langu 70 bududla ngasehlangotsini loludvute bese iba ngemakhilomitha langu 100 bududla ngasehlangotsini lolukhashane. Yincane ngephansi kwelwandle futsi yinkhulu etindzaweni letiphakeme. Kungenteka kube nalokunyenti emaceleni ngoba lolucwencwe luncane. Bekulula nga-lava kukhuphukela ngetulu.**

Now let's examine the answer choices:

*   **A: Luhlangotsi lolusedvute lune luhla lolungaphandle lolukhulu** - The text says the *opposite* is true; the near side crust is *thinner* (70 km) than the far side (100 km). So, this is incorrect.
*   **B: Loluhla lwangaphandle luncane kunetindzawo letisetulu** - This statement is the opposite from the facts provided. The text says ""Yincane ngephansi kwelwandle futsi yinkhulu etindzaweni letiphakeme"" which means the crust is greater in the upper portions of the moon. So, this is incorrect.
*   **C: Kungaba na-maria lomncane ehlangotsini lolukhashane** - The text states, ""Kungenteka kube nalokunyenti emaceleni ngoba lolucwencwe luncane. Bekulula nga-lava kukhuphukela ngetulu."", this suggests that since the crust is thicker on the far side, there would be less maria, as lava would have found it harder to come up to the surface. This statement aligns with that idea. Thus, this is the correct answer.
*   **D: Kungaba na-maria lomncane ngaphasi kwetindzawo letisetulu** - This statement is incorrect, the text says that the crust is greater in the upper portions of the moon.

**Therefore, the correct answer is C.**"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, kukuphi lapho lucwecwe lweNyanga lulukhulu khona?","The correct answer is **C: Ngaphasi kwetindzawo letisetulu**.

The passage states: ""Yincane ngephansi kwelwandle futsi yinkhulu etindzaweni letiphakeme"" which translates to ""It is thin under the maria and thick in the highland regions."" Highlands are ""tindzawo letiphakeme"" in Siswati.
"
"Ngekusekelwa indzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokukholelwa bantfu labatsite?","The correct answer is **C: Imphilo ikhona kulamanye maulanethi**.

The passage states: ""...labanye bayatibuta kutsi kunani lengaphandle labanye bakholwa kutsi kukhona tidalwa noma kukhona lokuphilako kuleminye imikhatsi."" This directly indicates that some people believe life exists on other planets.
"
Lokuba kuncane uma uchubeka uhamba usuka emkhatsini kwelilanga?,"The correct answer is **C: Igesi**.

The paragraph states: ""Lonkhe Lilanga lakhiwa ngemagesi, umlilo, kanye ne-plasma. **Lomoya uba muncane nawuchubekela khashane nemkhatsi welilanga.**""  This directly answers the question of what becomes thinner/less dense as you move away from the center of the sun.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguyiphi incenye yelilanga lebonakalako emhlabeni?","The correct answer is **C: I-phothosphere**.

"
Ngikuphi kuncoma lokungakabaluleki emfuleni i-Amazon?,"The correct answer is **C: Umfula lomkhulu lomudze wonkhe**

Here's why:

*   The passage states the Amazon is the **second largest** (in length) in the world, not the largest overall.
*   The passage mentions that it is the largest river by volume and the widest.
*  Option A is directly stated to be true.
*  Option B is directly stated to be true.
*  Option D is directly stated to be true."
Ngumuphi umugca wemsebenti locasha inombolo lencane yebantfu base-Venezuela?,"The correct answer is **C: I-Oyila**.

The passage states that only ""one percent"" of Venezuelans work in the oil sector, which is the smallest proportion mentioned. The other sectors have significantly higher proportions: agriculture (one in five), manufacturing (one in four), and the service sector (two out of three).
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguyiphi kulemikhakha lelandzelako lecasha bantfu inombolo lekhulu yebantfu base-Venezuela?","Based on the passage:

*   Two out of three working Venezuelans work in the service sector.
*   Roughly one in four work in manufacturing.
*   One in five work in agriculture.
*   Only 1% work in the oil industry.

Since two out of three is the largest fraction, the service sector employs the largest number of Venezuelans.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Umsebenti (Service)**.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kuhlangana kutivumela kutsi tenteni tinkhanyeti?","The correct answer is **C: Khipha kukhanya nekushisa**

The passage states: ""Tinkanyeti tiniketa kukhanya nekushisa ngenca yemandla laphuma ngesikhatsi ema-athomu e-hydrogene akheka (nobe ahlanganiswa) ndzawonye kwakha ema-elementi lasindzako."" which translates to ""Stars give off light and heat because of the energy released when hydrogen atoms form (or are fused) together to form heavier elements."" This directly says that stars emit light and heat due to fusion.
"
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungentiwa kuhlangana lokubuyisako lokulusito?,"Impendvulo lelungile ngu **A: I-Hydrogen**.

The passage states, ""Emanti akhiwa tincenye letimbili tema-athomu e-hydrogen kanye ne-athomu yinye yemoya lesiwuphefumulako."" This translates to ""Water is made of two parts of hydrogen atoms and one atom of the air we breathe (oxygen).""
"
Uma emanti ashintja simo yini lokusale kufana?,"The correct answer is **A: Sakhiwo se-molecular**.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that even when a substance changes state (gas, liquid, solid), its chemical makeup remains the same. Water (H2O) is used as an example, highlighting that it's always two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, regardless of whether it's ice, liquid water, or steam. This refers to the **sakhiwo se-molecular** (molecular structure).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kuminyana (Density):** The passage mentions that liquid nitrogen is denser than gaseous nitrogen. Density changes when a substance changes state.
*   **C: Simo semtimba (Physical state):** The passage explicitly states that the physical state changes (gas, liquid, or solid).
*   **D: I-nitrogen lemanti (Liquid nitrogen):** The passage uses liquid nitrogen as an example. The question asks what remains the same for **water** as it changes state."

Here's why:

*   **A: Kunganyelwa lokukhulu lokuvela kutiphatsimandla tembuso** - The passage explicitly states that the states didn't want to cooperate with the Congress and that the Congress was dependent on state authorities for enforcing its measures. This *was* a problem.
*   **C: Tichibiyelo letidzinga kugunyatwa ngelivi linye** - The passage also states that the Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended. This *was* a problem.
*   **D: Sikhulu selive lonkhe lesingekho** - The passage says that there was no chief executive. This *was* a problem.

*B: Kungabi nemandla phakatsi kwencubekelaphambili* is not mentioned in the passage as a problem with the Articles of Confederation."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngusiphi sitatimende lesiveta ngalokungiko simo sahulumende lomkhulu phakatsi kweMphi Yetingucuko?","The correct answer is **C: Bameli bembuso abakabi khona**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""tifundza titsetse hulumende kalula kutsi bameleli bakhe bebangekho tikhatsi letiningi."" This directly supports the claim that representatives of the state were often absent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umtsetfo wetintsela uphocelelwe ngukhongolose kanye netiphatsimandla telive** The passage directly contradicts this, stating: ""ICongress ayisenamandla ekucoca intela...beyiphindze ite imvume yekungayinaki imitsetfo yemtselo kanye neluhlelo lwemtselo lolubekwe nguhulumende.""

*   **B: Tichibiyelo tendzatjana betincike egunyeni lakhongolose** The passage says: ""Ema-Articles bekadzinga imvume levumelanako kuto tonkhe tifundza ngembi kwekutsi alungiswe"" Therefore the changes depend on the state.

*   **D: Hulumende lomkhulu bekanetincenye letibili letiyinhloko** The passage mentions that there was no president of the country, nor were there judges, meaning that there were not two central parts of the government."

Yini lengakashiwo njengesinyatselo lesidzingekako ehlelweni le-Italy lekuthumba emave ase-Afrika?,"The passage states:

*   Italy needed to control the Mediterranean to reach Africa.
*   To do so, they needed to overcome British bases and ships in Egypt.

Therefore, the necessary steps were:

*   To dismantle British bases.
* To remove ships from Egypt.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Kususa imikhumbi eGibhithe (Removing ships from Egypt):** This is mentioned as a necessity in the passage.
*   **B: Kwakha imikhumbi lengetiwe (Building more ships):** The passage mentions Italy already built ships.
*   **C: Kwakha i-pad yekucalisa yeliciniso (Building a launch pad of truth):** This is not mentioned in the passage and does not make sense in this context.
*   **D: Kubhidlita tisekelo taseBritain (Dismantling British bases):** This is also mentioned as a necessity in the passage.

The best answer is **C** because it's the only one NOT mentioned as a necessary step."
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, yini lebeyibukwa njenjongo yekucala ye-Italy ngalemphi?","The correct answer is **A: Kutfumba emave ase-Afrika**.

This clearly implies that the invention (irada/radar) forced submarines to submerge to avoid detection.
"
"Ekusebentisweni kwawo kwekucala, imikhumbingwenya beyinebubanti lobukalekile kakhulu kuyiphi indzawo?","Based on the passage:

The text states: ""Ngaleso sikhatsi beyihamba kancane kakhulu futsi beyingakhoni kudubula endzaweni lekhashane."" (At that time, they were very slow and could not shoot at a distant area.)

This directly addresses both speed (mobility/travel) and the ability to shoot (firepower). Comparing to the answer choices, option C aligns most closely with the explicit information provided.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Dubula (Shoot)**, because the passage indicates that the submarines of that era were limited in their shooting range/capabilities.

Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungakentiwa i-Red Army?,"Impendvulo lecondzile ngu **A: Kwakhiwa kwebuso be-Ukrainian**.

Nansi incazelo:

*   Lendlalela lichaza kutsi i-Red Army yente lokulandzelako:
    *   Yangena ePoland ngekwephula imitsetfo leminyenti (lokuchaza kutsi ""kwephulwa kwesivumelwano"" kwenteke)
    *   Yahlasela tifundza tasemphumalanga yePoland.

*   Lendlalela alikhulumi nge Red Army lehlela kabusha libhuloho.

*   Lendlalela alikhulumi nge Red Army leyakha buso be Ukrainian.

Ngako, ngalokusekelwe kulwatiso lolunikiwe, ngiko kuphela lokungentiwanga yi-Red Army kwakungukwakha buso be-Ukrainian."
Kwentekani kunjiniyela lomkhuli weMasotja Elishumi ase-Italy?,"The correct answer is **C: Uthunjwe maBritish** (He was captured by the British).

The passage states: ""Ekuhlaselweni kwemphumalanga yeBardia, emaBritish abamba Njiniyela Losetulu Welishumi Wase-Italy, General Lastucci."" This clearly indicates that the British captured the Senior Engineer of the Tenth Army of Italy, General Lastucci.
"
Wabulalelwaphi Italo Balbo?,"The correct answer is **D: E-Tobruk**.

The passage states that Marshal Italo Balbo was killed by friendly fire when arriving in Tobruk.

"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguwaphi emasu kulalandzelako layincenye lebalulekile yekuzindla kwe-Tibetan?","Ngiko lobese ukhetha imphendvulo lengiyo ngekusekelwe kulendzima:

The correct answer is **C: Kubona boNkulunkulu ngeliso lengcondvo**

**Justification:**

The passage explicitly states: ""Intfo bantfu base Tibet labazindla ngayo yi-Deity Yoga. Nawucabanga ngabonkulunkulu labehlukahlukene imizila yemandla iyahlanteka...""  This directly indicates that visualizing deities is a central part of Tibetan meditation.

While the passage mentions breathing techniques (A) and mantras (B) as being used to awaken Kundalini energy, it highlights Deity Yoga (C) as the *focus* of Tibetan meditation. Understanding yoga philosophy (D) is mentioned, but not in the context of it being a specific meditation technique.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, i-Chakras ivulwa njani ibeketelela “sikhungo” semitsi yase-Tibetan?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Ngekubona boNkulunkulu ngeliso lengcondvo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Intfo bantfu base Tibet labazindla ngayo yi-Deity Yoga. Nawucabanga ngabonkulunkulu labehlukahlukene imizila yemandla iyahlanteka, emandla ayavuseleleka bese kwakheka likhono lekuhlukanisa lokulungile nalokungakalungi."" This directly links visualizing deities to cleansing energy channels and developing discernment. While A, C, and D are also elements mentioned, the passage most closely associates the visualization of deities with the benefits described."
Ngubani lothule ingoma yesibili yemkhuleko phakatsi ehlelweni?,"The correct answer is **D: NguJai Shankar Choudhary**.

The passage states that Sanju Sharma started the singing and was followed by Jai Shankar Choudhary.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani lowathula ingoma yemkhuleko ngalesikhatsi kunikelwa kudla?","The correct answer is **A: NguLakkha Singh**.

The passage states: ""Lakkha Singh wayetfula kahle ichhappan bhog bhajan futsi"" which translates to ""Lakkha Singh was presenting the chhappan bhog bhajan well too"". This implies he was the one singing the devotional song during the offering of the 56 different food items (Chhappan Bhog).
"
Bekungumuphi umdlalo wesibili ekugcineni kwebusuku?,"The passage states: ""Kucedzela, licembu lekudansa iFire of Anatolia lenta lombukiso i""""Troy""""."" which translates to: ""Finally, the Fire of Anatolia dance group performed the show """"Troy""""."" This means Fire of Anatolia was the final performance. The question asks about the *second to last* performance. The sentence before that states: ""Umhlabeli waseTurkey Sezen Aksu uhlabele kanye nemhlabeli we-tenor wase-Italy Alessandro Safina kanye nemhlabeli longumGreki Haris Alexiou."" which translates to: ""The Turkish singer Sezen Aksu sang together with the Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and the Greek singer Haris Alexiou.""

Therefore, the second to last performance was Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina and Haris Alexiou.

The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina kanye naHaris Alexiou**.
"
Ngubuphi buve ba-Alessandro Safina?,"The correct answer is **D: Wase-Italy**. The passage explicitly states that Alessandro Safina is an Italian tenor singer.
"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, ngusiphi kuletitatimende letilandzelako lesingasilo liciniso?","The statement that is NOT true according to the passage is **A: Bekunemlilo e-Santa Clara**.

The passage mentions the fire captain, but it doesn't actually say there was a fire. It describes a hot day and people being stuck on a roller coaster. The fire captain's quote seems to be about the general situation, not a specific fire incident. The other options are explicitly mentioned in the passage:

*   **B: Bantfu bebakhacamele ku-roller coaster:** The passage states ""...sikhatsi losicitsa uvalelekile ku-roller coaster sikwenta ungakhululeki..."" implying that they were stuck.
*   **C: Bagibeli banikwe emanti:** The passage says ""Bagibeli baniketwa emanti njengoba bebalindze...""
*   **D: Kutsatse lokungenani imizuzu lengu-60 kukhipha umuntfu wekucala lobekagibele lomshini wekutijabulisa:** The passage says ""kutsatsa lokungenani li-awa linye kutsi umuntfu wekucala aphume."" One hour is equal to 60 minutes.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani lophawulile mayelana nekungakhululeki kwelizinga lekushisa?","The correct answer is **B: Umphatsi wemlilo**.

The passage explicitly states ""Kapteni wemlilo Scott Kouns utsi..."". This translates to ""Fire Captain Scott Kouns says..."" and then he makes the comment about the discomfort caused by the heat.
"
Lapho bekuncamuka khona gezi ngenca yeTsunami?,"The correct answer is **A: E-Tonga**.

The text states ""...gesi wahamba kwesikhashana, lokwavimbela tiphatsimandla taseTonga kutsi tive lesicwayiso..."" which directly indicates a power outage in Tonga due to the events.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, beyitsintseka kanjani iTonga ngekuncamuka kwagezi?","The correct answer is **D: Tiphatsimandla atikakhoni kutfola ticwayiso letifanele**.

The passage states that the power outage ""prevented Tongan authorities from receiving the tsunami warning issued by the PTWC."" This directly means the authorities were unable to receive the warnings.
"
Emaphoyisa ayokhona nini kusebentisa tibhamu tawo tematubane kute bashaye sivinini sekushayela kwaJonny Reid?,"Impendvulo lecondzile ngu: **A: Ngalesikhatsi ahamba ngesivinini lesingu-160 emakhilomitha ngelihora**

Lomlayeto usho kutsi emaphoyisa akhone kufundza sivinini saJohny Reid kuphela ngalesikhatsi ehlisa sivinini saya ku-160km/h.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungani kumatima emaphoyiseni ase-New Zealand kubamba sivinini saJonny Reid?","The correct answer is **B: Imoto beyiphasi kakhulu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Emaphoyisa aseNew Zealand bekanebumatima kusebentisa letibhamu tabo letinesivinini kubona kutsi Umnumzane Reid bekagijima kakhulu ngelizinga lelinganani ngenca yekutsi Black Beauty unjani...""

This directly implies that the police had difficulty because of the nature of the Black Beauty car, and the text continues to say, ""futsi lesikhatsi lesisodvwa lamaphoyisa lakhone kufundza ngaso sivinini seMnumzane Reid kwaba ngulapho ehlisa sivinini kuya ku-160km/h"" This shows that they could only accurately measure his speed when he slowed down to 160km/h.
"
Kutamatama kwemhlaba bekugcile kuphi macondzana ne-Butte?,"The correct answer is **D: 65 emamayela enyakatho**.

The passage states the earthquake was approximately 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Butte. Since the question asks the earthquake's location *relative to* Butte, the answer is that Butte is 65 miles north of the earthquake's epicenter.
"
Kwentekani ngesikhatsi seludlame e-Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **D: Lijele lashiswa**

The passage states: ""Lijele lase Iraq i-Abu Ghraib lishisiwe ngesikhatsi kusuke ludlame."" which directly translates to ""The Iraqi Abu Ghraib prison was burned down during the violence.""
"
Kungani lijele lase-Iraqi lizuze ludvumo? ,"The correct answer is **D: Kutfolakala kwekuhlukunyetwa kwetiboshwa**.

The passage states the prison became notorious *after* the prisoner abuse was discovered. While the other options may be related to the prison, the passage directly links its notoriety to the abuse revelations.
"
Luhlobo luni lemcimbi lobowutawuba eMaui War Memorial Stadium?,"Based on the passage, the event was a ""lelicembu lebahlabeleli likhansele umbukiso"" which translates to ""a singing group cancelled a show.""

Therefore, the answer is not explicitly listed, but based on the options, the closest would be a show, not listed.

Since none of the options are directly related to the passage, the answer is unknown."
Lowagcina anikete inchazelo mayelana nekuhociswa kwemcimbi?,"The correct answer is **B: Inkampani yekuphatsa**.

The passage states that ""Inkampane lephetse lelicembu, i-HK Management Inc, ayikaniketi sizatfu sekucala ngesikhatsi ikhansela...kodvwa yasola tizatfu letinengcondvo ngelusuku lelilandzelako.""  This means the management company (inkampani yekuphatsa) ultimately offered a reason.
"
Bobani labaningana betakhamuti tase-Bishkek labacabanga kutsi banelicala lekuphanga?,"The correct answer is **D: Insha**.

The passage says that ""tigebengu tihamba etitaladini tigcekeza titolo letinetimphahla tebatsengi"". Tigebengu translate to **insha**.
"
Ngubani losole babhikishi baseningizimu ngekutapa?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **not explicitly stated**. The passage says residents are protesting about the breakdown of law and order, but doesn't say who is accusing the protesters of looting. So, the answer that best fits the context, albeit indirectly, is:

*   **D: Emacembu ebantfu** (loosely translated as ""groups of people"")

**Explanation**

The passage says, ""Takhamuti letinyenti taseBishkek tibhikishe tisuka eningizimu tikhala ngekwephulwa kwemtsetfo."" This translates to ""Many Bishkek residents marched from the south, complaining about the violation of the law."" The passage does not state who is accusing these protesters of looting, but in circumstances like the one described here it's often groups of people that are making accusations.
"
Ngubani lowatfola indandatho lekhuphule intsengo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngemuva kwekuvela eThangini laShaka**.

The text specifically states that Ring's sales increased after Siminoff appeared on Shark Tank.
"
Jamie Siminoff ukhetse nini kucala i-Ring?,"Impendvulo lecondzile ngu **A: Ngemuva kwekubona insimbi yakhe yasemnyango benyinganeli**

Lesisho lesitsatfu sekucala sesigaba sichaza kahle kutsi Siminoff wakhetse kucala nini i-Ring. Lesi sinye siyehluka kuletinye tinkhetfo letintsatfu, letichaza imicimbi leyalandzela ngemuva kwaleso sincumo.
"
Sicephu ngasinye semusho wenkosatane saloko lokugcinela indzawo yekuhlala?,"The best answer is **A: Umdlalo wamabonakudze**

Here's why:

*   The passage describes a PBS show (""Umbukiso we-PBS""). PBS shows are television programs, making ""umdlalo wamabonakudze"" (television show) the most direct and relevant answer.

The other options are related to the passage, but aren't the central focus the passage is about:

*   B: Umtapo welwati wendzawo - Libraries are mentioned as places where children can find recommended books, but the show itself is not a library.
*   C: Tingcikitsi - Themes are present in the show but is not what the passage is about.
*   D: Tincwadzi - Books are the subject of each episode, but the show itself is not a book.
"
Lokungenteka kube nemtselela ekusuleni Luchungechunge lekufudza umusho wenkosatana?,"The correct answer is **A: Luchaso lolunganeli**.

The passage discusses the possible reasons for the end of TV shows like Reading Rainbow. The reasons mentioned are:

*   **Financial constraints (uchekeka kwemali):** The show lacked the financial budget to stay on the air.
*   **Changes in educational philosophy on television (filosofi yekufundzisa etinhlelweni tamabonakudze):** The way kids shows are structured changed, possibly making Reading Rainbow seem outdated.

The reasons provided are a lack of money and the current culture around kid's tv shows. It does not explain Princess Series.

Therefore, the most fitting answer is ""luchaso lolunganeli"" (insufficient information) because the text talks about the factors influencing the cancellation of educational TV shows in general, not specifically the ""Princess Series."""
Ngikuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo ingcabano leyentiwe tikhulu te-Amsterdam kanye ne-Museum mayelana nesihlahla?,"Impendvulo lelungile ngu- **B: Kufanele igcinwe**

Lesicaphuno sisho kutsi tikhulu kanye ne-Museum batawufuna kutsi sigawulwe. Leyo yindlela yekuphela lephambene nekwenta umbango wayo.
"
Ngekwemhloli lomkhulu wekuhlolwa kwe-RSPCA kufanele kube kutayelekile kulokulandzelako?,"The correct answer is **C: Kufakwa kwekugada**

Here's why:

The passage states that the RSPCA wants to enforce CCTV cameras in slaughterhouses. David O'Shannessy, the chief inspector of the RSPCA, says that monitoring and inspection should be routine in Australia. Therefore, installing surveillance/CCTV is something he thinks should be more routine."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lengasita ekuciniseni kubaluleka kwenhlalakahle yetilwane kubasebenti base-Australia labahlindzako?","The correct answer is **A: Kufakwa kwekhamera i-CCTV**.

The passage states that the RSPCA believes CCTV footage will send a strong message to workers handling animals that their welfare is paramount. Therefore, installing CCTV cameras is seen as a way to reinforce the importance of animal welfare.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini umsebenti walomuntfu loboshiwe?","The correct answer is **A: Mfundzi**

The passage states ""...umngcwabo wa-Jeff Weise nalabanye labatsatfu...kulomunye umfundzi uboshiwe..."" meaning ""...the funeral of Jeff Weise and three others...another student has been arrested..."". Therefore, the arrested person is a student.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungani kusabalala tindzaba tekutsi kubanjwe lomunye umngwabo loboshiwe ngoba bangaki labahlukumetekile?","The correct answer is **C: Imfica**.

The passage states: ""Tindzaba tivakele wonkhe ummango weRed Lake namuhla njengobe umngcwabo wa-Jeff Weise nalabanye labatsatfu kulabantfu labayimfica labatsintsekile wachubeka nalomunye umfundzi uboshiwe mayelana nalokudubula kwasesikolweni mhlaka-21 Indlovulenkhulu."" This clearly indicates that there were *imfica* (nine) people affected. The reason the news is spreading is due to the funeral of Jeff Weise and three others of the nine victims.
"
Ekuphendvuleni umbhikisho nguliphi live lelingamange lichubekele phambili nesivumelwano salo se-ACTA?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Poland**. The text states that ""the government of Poland decided not to sign the agreement, for now"" after protests.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngumaphi emave lalandzelako kuhlehlisa inchubo yekujoyina i-ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: I-Latvia**.

The passage explicitly states: ""ILatvia neSlovakia bonkhe baphutile ngeluhlelo lwekujoyina i-ACTA.""
"
Bangaki bantfu labalimele ngenca yetigameko tekushisa kakhulu kwe-iPod?,"The correct answer is A: 4

The passage states that there were ""six fire incidents and minor burns to four people."" So, the number of people injured due to iPod overheating incidents is 4.
"
Ngubani lowatse sigameko sekushisa ngalokwecile besingasisibi kakhulu?,"The correct answer is **A: I-METI**.

The passage states that METI (the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in Japan) reported that Apple called the additional 34 incidents ""not so serious incidents.""
"
Ngesikhatsi senkhuluma indzaba Steve Jobs atsi li-apula litayisungula ngekushesha?,"The correct answer is **B: Lolucingo**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Lamuhla i-Apple itokwakha kabusha **lucingo**, sitocopha umlandvo lamuhla"" (Today Apple will rebuild the **telephone/phone**, we will make history today).
*   Therefore, Steve Jobs was referring to rebuilding/reinventing the **telephone/phone**
"
Bekuyini inhloso yenkhuluma ya-Steve Jobs yemahora lamabili?,"The correct answer is **C: Kucalisa makhalekhikhini**.

The paragraph states that Steve Jobs took an iPhone out of his pocket and said ""Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone, we are making history today."" This clearly indicates the purpose of his speech was to launch the iPhone (makhalekhikhini).
"
Yindzaba Cristina Fernandez ayikamenteli enkhundleni yemidlalo yase-Argentine?,"The correct answer is **B: Inhloso yakhe yekuphatsa umbuso** (Her intention to rule the government).

The passage states that Mrs. Kirchner ""utfule inhloso yakhe yekungenela kuba ngumongameli"" which directly translates to ""she presented her intention to run for president."" Running for president is directly related to the intention of ruling/governing the government.
"
Christina Fernandez umemetele kuphi inhloso yakhe yekugijima?,"The correct answer is **B: e-Buenos aires inkundla e-La Plata**

Here's why:

The passage states that she announced her candidacy in La Plata, a city 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires. The specific venue was the Argentine Theatre, but the main location is La Plata. While the Argentine Theatre and Buenos Aires are mentioned, ""La Plata"" is the more precise and complete answer to the question of *where* she made the announcement.
"
Yini letfolwe yi-ACMA mayelana neBig brother?,"The correct answer is **A: Imitsetfo yokucwaninga beyingakaphulwa** (The censorship rules had not been broken).

The passage explicitly states that ACMA found that Big Brother did not violate internet content regulations because the content was not stored on the Big Brother website.
"
Ngutiphi tinhlaka lekufanele imidiya iwele ngaphasi kwayo kute icabangele lokucuketfwe i-inthanethi?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Kumele ngekweliciniso uhlale endzaweni ukhonta**.

The passage states that for online content to be regulated under the Broadcasting Services Act, it must ""permanently reside on the content host's service."" This is essentially the same as saying ""it must actually reside on the service providing the content.""
"
Ngubani umholi we-Liberal Party yase-Australia?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngu-John Howard**.

The passage states that Peter Costello was expected to succeed Prime Minister John Howard as the leader of the Liberal party. This means John Howard was the current leader at the time.
"
Kungani i-Australia ibete kwakudzala imboni yemandla enuzi ?,"Based on the provided quote, the only reason discussed as to why Australia *might* not have a nuclear power industry is:

*   **D: Kubita kakhulu (Too expensive)**

Peter Costello says if nuclear power is ""commercially viable"" (not too expensive), then Australia should pursue it. This implies that cost is a primary consideration and a potential barrier to the industry's development. The other options are not explicitly mentioned in the excerpt."
Ngumuphi umshwibi locudzelana naye ngelusito lemhlahlandlela?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngu-Maciej Krezel**

The text states: ""Indvodza lengaboni emehlweni yasePoland lentjuza echweni Maciej Krezel nalomsitako Anna Ogarzynska baphume namba 13 emcudzelwaneni weSuper G."" This clearly indicates Maciej Krezel is the skier who uses a guide. Anna Ogarzynska is his guide.
"
Nguliphi live lelicadze endzaweni Yelishimi ku-Super-G Kubesifazana labamile?,"A: I-Finland
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngusiphi sitatimende lesimayelana ne-Blake lesingasiso selucobo?","The correct answer is **B: Wavuma kuhlasela**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Blake **phikile kutsi kunebantfu labekabahlasela** which translates to ""denied that he was attacking anyone."" This directly contradicts option B.
*   The other options are all supported by the passage:
    *   **A: Waboshwa kulendzawo yesigameko** - The passage mentions he was arrested at the scene.
    *   **C: Wasebentise lipali ngesikhatsi sekuhlasela** - He claimed he used a pole for self-defense.
    *   **D: Watse emabhodlela ajikijelwe kuye** - He stated that thirty people were throwing bottles at him."
"Ngalokusekelwe kulendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungamange kwente ku-Blake?","The correct answer is **C: Wahlaselwa ngelipali**.

The passage states Blake *used* a pole for self-defense, claiming he was being attacked with bottles. It does *not* say he was attacked *by* a pole. The other options are explicitly mentioned as happening to Blake:

*   **A: Watfolakala anelicala lekuhlaneketela bulungiswa (Watfolakala enelicala lekutama kuphatamisa kusebenta kwemtsetfo.)** This is a direct translation of ""Watfolakala enelicala lekutama kuphatamisa kusebenta kwemtsetfo.""
*   **B: Waboshwa (loboshwe kulendzawo yalesigameko)** The passage states he was arrested at the scene (""loboshwe kulendzawo yalesigameko"").
*   **D: Watjelwa kutsi kungenteka atfunyelwe ejele (Lelijaji latjela Blake kutsi """"cishe kutokwenteka"""" kutsi utotfunyelwa ejele.)** The judge told him it was ""likely"" he would be sent to prison (""Lelijaji latjela Blake kutsi """"cishe kutokwenteka"""" kutsi utotfunyelwa ejele."").

Therefore, the only thing that *didn't* happen to Blake, according to the passage, is being attacked with a pole.
"
Ingabe yini sikhwama se-U.N. sekufutfumala kwemhlaba ngekwawo lesingeke sisetjentiselwe kona?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuletsa buchwepheshe emaveni latfutfukako**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states that technology transfer is a separate discussion point at Bali, *not* part of the U.N. funding for climate change impacts. The U.N. fund is specifically for helping countries *adapt* to the effects of climate change (like building flood defenses or improving water management), whereas transferring technology is seen as a means of helping developing countries develop sustainably, which is a separate item.

*   **A, C, and D** are all explicitly mentioned in the text as potential uses for the U.N. fund.

Therefore, the U.N. fund would *not* be used for bringing technology to developing nations.
"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, yini i-U.N. lenelitsemba lekuyisindzisa?","The correct answer is **A: Imali, ngekwabelana ngebuchwepheshe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""I-U.N. nayo yetsemba kutsi itawucedzelela kuhlanganisa imali yekusita emave lahlaselwe kushisa kakhulu kwemhlaba."" (The U.N. also hopes to finalize gathering funds to help countries affected by global warming.) This directly supports the ""Imali"" (money) part of option A.
* The passage also mentions: ""kufundzisa labanye ngebuchwepheshe kute kusite ekutfutfukiseni emave lasatfutfuka kutsi atsi atfutfuka abe angawonakalisi umhlaba."" This directly supports the ""ngekwabelana ngebuchwepheshe"" (by sharing technology) part of option A.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Titjalo (Plants):** While the passage mentions expanding crops as a possible use for the funds, the U.N.'s primary hope is to finalize the fund itself.
*   **C: Emahlatsi emvula lasele (Remaining rainforests):** While protecting forests is mentioned in the passage, it is not the U.N.'s specific hope in this context.
*   **D: Bantfu labatsikametwe kungaphatfwa kahle kwemanti (People affected by poor water management):** While improved water management is a possible use of the funds, the U.N.'s primary hope is to finalize the fund itself.
"
Ngukuphu kulokulandzelako lonkungangabalilwa mngu-Albert McCall njengalamanye lokusamele kuvunyelwane ngawo?,"The correct answer is **D: Imvume yentsela**

Here's why:

*   The quote explicitly states, ""Sisengakavumi mayelana nemitsetfo yemisuka nekukhokha nekuvumelana ngemitselo..."" which means they haven't agreed on taxation agreements.
*   The quote also states, ""Sisengakavumi mayelana nemitsetfo yemisuka"" which means the rules of origin are still yet to be agreed upon.
* The quote does state that the frame work they have is enough to start trading on July 1st 2020 which means the start date is confirmed.
* The quote explicitly mentions that Benin will join."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kungani kuhweba kungacali ngeNhlaba?","The correct answer is **D: Imitsetfo yekucala kanye nemvume yentsengo kuvumelwane ngayo**.

The passage states: ""Sisengakavumi mayelana nemitsetfo yemisuka nekukhokha nekuvumelana ngemitselo..."" This directly indicates that rules of origin, payment modalities, and tax concessions were *not* yet agreed upon.  Therefore, the original trade and licensing had been approved.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, liphephandzaba lase-Atlanta lasola ngani tikhulu tetemfundvo?","The correct answer is **C: Kungasebenti ngetinkinga taphakatsi letitholiwe**.

The passage states that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's report revealed that the schools ""saw problems but took no action on the findings."" This directly corresponds to option C, ""failure to act on internally found problems."" The report *itself* didn't accuse the officials of falsifying test scores; it revealed the problematic *results* and the lack of action. The falsification was revealed later through evidence.
"
"Ngalokusekelwe elwatini loluniketwwe endzimeni, yini lekungakashiwo ku-journal-Constitution?","The correct answer is **B: Bufakazi kutsi emaphepha ekuhlolwa alingwe ngabo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Bufakazi bukhombisa kutsi emaphepha eluhlolo aphatanyiswa"". That is, the test papers were tampered with.
*   The passage explicitly states: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published a report that showed: ""tinombolo taloluhlolo tikhuphuke ngekushesha, nekutsi lesikolwa satibona tinkinga kodvwa sangatsatsi tinyatselo kuloko bekutfoliwe."" That is, untypical test scores were improved.
*   It also explicitly states the year that 34 educators were indicted in 2013, making C incorrect.
*   The passage makes no mention of innovative urban education.

Option B, evidence that test papers were scored, does not appear in the passage, so it is the answer."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguluphi lwati lolatiwako mayelana nekubhoma?","The correct answer is **B: Ngutiphi takhiwo ibhomu lechume dvute nato** (Which buildings did the bomb explode near).

The passage states that bombs exploded ""eceleni kwetakhiwo tahulumende"" (next to government buildings).  The other options are explicitly stated as uncertain or not yet confirmed in the passage.
"
"Soloku wajoyina iManchester City ngo-2017, mingaki imidlalo layidlalile Jesus?","The correct answer is D: 53

The passage states: ""Kusukela ngaleso sikhatsi lomdlali waseBrazil sewudlale emahlandla langu-53 kulelicembu lakhe..."" meaning ""...since then the Brazilian player has played 53 times for his team...""
"
Nguliphi licembu lapho Jesus bekathola £27 million ngekuyijoyina?,"The correct answer is **B: Manchester City**.

The passage states that Jesus joined Manchester City from Palmeiras.
"
ngusiphi sitatimende lesingasilo liciniso mayelana tivakashi tasehhotela?,"The correct answer is **D: Liningi letivakashi betivela edolobheni lelincwele**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states that the hostel was in Mecca and catered to visitors coming for the Hajj pilgrimage.
*   **P** also states that the hostel guests were primarily from the United Arab Emirates.
*   Therefore, a large number of the visitors would **not** have been from the holy city.
*   Options A, B, and C are all true.

Therefore, option D is the only statement that is not true based on the provided information."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngusiphi sitatimende saletilandzelako lesiliciniso?","The correct answer is **B: Tonkhe tivakashi tibuya e-United Arab Emirates.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Letivakashi tasehostela ikakhulu bekutakhamuti tase-United Arab Emirates"" (The hostel guests were mainly citizens of the United Arab Emirates). ""Ikakhulu"" means ""mainly"", so we can infer that all the guests were from the United Arab Emirates.
*   **A: Kute labashonile** is incorrect because the passage clearly states that there are at least 15 fatalities.
*   **C: Letivakashi betikhona ngelusuku lekwandulela hajj** is incorrect because the passage mentions ""busuku be-hajj pilgrimage,"" indicating the night *of* the hajj pilgrimage, not the night before.
*   **D: Liningi letivakashi lihlala eMecca** is incorrect because the passage says that the visitors are from the United Arab Emirates."
"Ngalokusekelwe endzimeni, kutsi nguluphi lwati mayelana nekuhlangana lokungacaci?","The correct answer is **C: Utselela wekushayisana emhlabeni**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Bososayensi batsi kuchuma lokwabangelwa ngulokushayisana kwaba kukhulu kakhulu. Basetama kutfola kutsi kube ngakanani lokuphihliteka nekutsi uMhlaba utsikameteke njani."" This indicates that scientists are still trying to determine the impact of the collision on Earth. Therefore, the extent of the collision's impact on Earth is uncertain.

The other options are incorrect because the passage either states them directly or suggests they will be known soon:

*   **A: Bukhulu bekushayisana** - While the exact size is still being determined (the extent of the debris), the passage mentions the satellite's weight and speed.
*   **B: Indzawo yekushayisana** - The passage mentions the collision occurred 491 miles above Earth.
*   **D: Indzawo yemfecumfecu** - The U.S. Space Command is tracking the debris, implying that its location is being monitored."
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lesadzinga kuncunywa mayelana nekushayisana?","The correct answer is **D: Sikali lekungiso sekuphahlaka**.

The passage states that scientists are trying to determine the extent of the collision and how it affected the Earth. This directly relates to the scale of the crash. The other options are not the primary focus of what the passage is about the scientists trying to determine.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, nguyiphi indzawo Batten lake wayibamba ehlwini lwaseMelika lebantfu labacebe kakhulu?","The correct answer is **C: Yesi-190**

The passage states that Batten was ranked as the 190th richest person in America in 2008.
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lapho Batten ente umnikelo khona?,"The correct answer is **B: Enyuvesi yase-Virginia**.

The passage states that Batten ""bekafaka sandla ekunikeleni kuleso sikolwa,"" and the sentence before identifies ""leso sikolwa"" as the ""Kolishi Letebuciko Nesayensi yaseNyuvesi yeVirginia"" (College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Virginia).
"
Litsini ligalelo lemtsetfo sivivinya losayinwe umbusi Arnold Schwarzenegger?,"The best answer is **D: Imfuneko Yedecal emidlalweni leneludlame**

Here's why:

*   The passage clearly states that the law requires violent video games sold in California to have an ""18"" label. This directly corresponds to requiring labels on violent games.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as accurate:

*   **A: Kuvimbelwa kwekutsengisa noma kwekucashwa kwemidlalo yevidiyo leneludlame kulo lonkhe lase-California** (Prohibition of selling or renting violent video games throughout California): This is not entirely correct. The law prohibits selling/renting *to minors*, but doesn't completely ban the sale of violent games.

*   **B: Tinhlawulo temali yalabente lokubi** (Monetary penalties for wrongdoers): While the law *does* introduce fines, this is a consequence of violating the law, not the main effect of the law itself.

*   **C: Kuvimbelwa kwekutsengisa noma kwekucashwa kwemidlalo yevidiyo neludlame ngaphandle kwe-California** (Prohibition of selling or renting violent video games outside of California): The passage is specific to California.

"
"Ngekusho kwenzima, ngubani londlulwe ngulokukhulumiwe?","The correct answer is **D: Ngu-Duvall**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Duvall didn't leave a clear picture for Miller (who is the focus of the story). This suggests that Duvall is the one being talked about or discussed (though indirectly).
* The rest of the passage is Miller reacting to something Mike said, but the primary context is Duvall's absence of information.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokuliciniso kulokuhlangene nako kwa-Miller ekucileni macala?","The correct answer is **B: Bekangakanaki ngalesikhatsi atilungiselela**.

Here's why:

* The text says Miller said, ""Mike ukhuluma kakhulu nakuchubeka lelicala...bengitilungiselela ngako-ke angivanga kahle kutsi bekatsini."" This directly translates to ""Mike talks a lot as the case progresses... I was preparing so I didn't hear well what he was saying."" This indicates he wasn't paying attention because he was preoccupied with preparing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Duvall wente umbono ku-Miller ngesikhatsi sekulalela emacala**: The text doesn't explicitly say Duvall was *making* a point to Miller *during* the hearing. It only mentions Duvall didn't leave Miller a large picture to look at.
* **C: Bantfwana baDuvall lababili bakhuluma kakhulu ngesikhatsi sekulalelwa kwelicala**: The text only mentions Duvall had two grown children; it doesn't say they were at the hearing or talking.
* **D: Bekayinakisisile indzaba yaDuvall**: Miller's statement implies he *wasn't* paying attention, not that he was focused on Duvall's situation.

Therefore, option B is the only one directly supported by the text.
"
Ngubani lophakamise kutsi kubuyeketwe ‘Umtsetfo Wemoya Lohlantekile’?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngu-Jack Layton**.

The passage states that ""Layton ucele lushintjo ngesikwelede etintfweni letiphatselene nelushitjo kutemvelo kumhlangano ne-PM, wacela """"kutsi kucedvwe kubhala kabusha"""" Lushintjo kulephathi ngesikwelede setemvelo."" This indicates that Jack Layton requested changes to the bill, implying he suggested it be reviewed.
"
Ngubani lophikile kutsi “sento semoya lohlobile” besisebentiswa njenge sento sangaphambi kwelukhetfo?,"The passage says that after the Federal Government started financially supporting the Mersey hospital, ""the governing Liberal party and local federal MPs criticised the move as an election ploy.""

Therefore, the answer is **D: I-federal MP**.  While the Prime Minister is mentioned, they are defending the action, not criticizing it.
"
Takhi te-cyanuric acid nemelamine takha ini lapho uma tisabela emchameni wakati?,"Impendvulo lecondzile ngu **C: Emakristali**

Lesicatfu lesihlatiya siyacacisa kutsi i-cyanuric acid ne-melamine tiyahlanganisa kuze takhe emakristali langahle avale tinso. Loku kuyakwenta impendvulo ""emakristali"" imphendvulo lecondzile.

Loku kusho kutsi i-FTIR isetjentiswe kute ihlole kwakheka kwe-kristali.

Yini lengazange yenteke kulomshayeli lobandzakanyeke engotini?,"The correct answer is **C: Wasuswa esibhedlela eCambridge wayiswa ekulesinye eGreat Yarmouth**.

The passage states the opposite: the driver was moved *from* James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth *to* Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. The other options are all supported by the passage.
"
Yini lebeyingagcamanga ngemdlalo weNingizimu Afrika ngesikhatsi semchudzelwano welibhola lembhoco.,"The best answer is **C: Umdlalo lophuculiwe ekucaleni kwemchudzelwano**.

The passage specifically mentions ""iNingizimu Afrika itse kuphakamisa lizinga ngesikhatsi lomcudzelwano usachubeka,"" which translates to South Africa intending to raise the level as the tournament progresses.  This directly implies improved performance as the tournament continues.  The other options are described as already being strengths of the team.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, umdlalo waseNingizimu Afrika ucale nini kuba ncono?","The correct answer is **D: Njengoba umcudzelwano uchubeka**.

The passage states: ""iNingizimu Afrika itse kuphakamisa lizinga ngesikhatsi lomcudzelwano usachubeka."" This translates to ""South Africa aimed to raise their level as the tournament continued.""
"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, ngusiphi kuletitatimende letilandzelako lesingakhombosi ngalokungiko umnotfo wase-China?","The correct answer is **D: I-China ayikase itfumele timoto ngaphandle kundlila iJalimani**.

The passage states: ""Kwekucala ngca, emnyakeni lophelile iShayina itfumele timoto kulamanye emave kwendlula iJalimane futsi yendlula neMelika yaba ngiyo lenemakethe lehamba phambili kulemboni."" (For the first time, last year China exported more cars than Germany and surpassed the US to become the leading market in the industry.) This directly contradicts statement D. The other statements (A, B, and C) are all supported by the passage.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, i-GDP yaseChina ingayindlula nini yase-United State?","The correct answer is **B: Emkhatsini kwemashumi lamabili emnyaka** (Within twenty years).

The passage states: ""Umnotfo waseShayina ungase ube mkhulu kunowaseMelika kungakapheli iminyaka lengamashumi lamabili."" This directly translates to ""The Chinese economy may be larger than the American economy within twenty years.""
"
Huwaphakamisa kutsi emave lasatfutfuka enteni?,"The correct answer is **D: Kugwema indlela lendzala yekungcola**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Hu wakhutsata emave latfutfukako """"kutsi agweme lendlela lendzala yekungcolisa kucala bese ayakhuculula kuhlobisa ngekuhamba kwesikhatsi."""" (Hu encouraged developing countries ""to avoid the old way of polluting first and cleaning up later."")

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: Batsetse tibopho letichilita sigaba sabo sekutfutfuka (Take on responsibilities that stifle their development stage) - Hu said countries should not take on responsibilities beyond their capacity.
*   B: Gcila ekuphumeni kwemnotho (Focus on economic output) - While economic development is important, Hu emphasized environmentally sustainable development.
*   C: Bandlulele ngale kwetibopho tabo tamanje (Exceed their current obligations) - Hu said countries should not take on responsibilities beyond their capacity.
"
Lokungakashiwo ngu-Hu?,"The correct answer is **C: Lusuku lapho kushiswa kwekhaboni kutsembakala kutsi kutoncanyulwa khona**

Here's why:

*   **A: Sisekelo sekusikeka (The basis of the cut):** Hu mentions that the carbon dioxide reduction per unit of GDP will be at a significant rate, compared to 2005 levels.
*   **B: Seluleko emaveni lasatfutfuka mayelana nekungcola (Advice to developing countries on pollution):** Hu explicitly advises developing countries to avoid the ""pollute first, clean up later"" model.
*   **D: Sibalo sekuncamuka kwekushiswa kwekhabhoni (The amount of carbon emissions reduction):** The passage states that Hu did *not* specify the exact amount of the reduction.

The passage does not state a specific date when the carbon emissions cut will be achieved, therefore, **C** is the answer."
Kunaku lokulandzelako ngukuphi Veerman latsite simo besingasikahle?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Angola**.

Richard Veerman, who speaks for Medicines Sans Frontieres, said that Angola is facing the worst outbreak ever and the situation will continue to be severe in Angola.
"
Ngenca yemshushisi lototsatsa sikhundla saHuhne?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngu-Davey**.

"
Ngubani lotobamba lichaza langcongcoshe wetemabhizinisi ngemuva kwekushushiswa?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngu-Lamb**.

The passage states: ""Norman Lamb MP kulindzeleke kutsi atsatse lomsebenti loshiywe nguDavey wekuba nguLobuke Temabhizinisi"" (Norman Lamb MP is expected to take over the job left by Davey as the Secretary of State for Business).
"
Yini loku badlali bakhutsata tibukeli kutsi tente ngesikhatsi se-operaye-Camille Saint-Saen?,"The correct answer is **A: Bahlanganyele ekusebenteni kwe-cannabis**.

The passage states, ""Labantfu labaphefomako babhema insangu nabasesiteji lokwenta kutsi wonkhe umuntfu lolangekhatsi afise kubhema."" This translates to ""The performers smoked marijuana on stage making everyone watching want to smoke."" Therefore, the actors encouraged the audience to use cannabis.
"
Ngubani locale wabhema ijoyinti ngesikhatsi se-opera?,"The passage states that ""Labantfu labaphefomako babhema insangu nabasesiteji..."" which translates to ""People who breathe smoke marijuana on stage...""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **C: Badlali** (The actors)"
Nguliphi lelinye ligama le-”spacewalk” lelidlalwe ngu Leonov?,"The correct answer is **C: Umsebenti extravehicular**.

The passage states: ""NgeNdlovulenkhulu mhlatili-18, nga-1965, wenta i-extravehicular activity (EVA) lephetfwe yekucala ngca, noma i-""""spacewalk"""",...""  This clearly equates EVA with ""spacewalk"".
"
Leonov wahola incenye yeSoviet kumuphi umsebenti?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku-Apollo-Soyuz**.

The passage states: ""Ngemuva kweminyaka lelishumi, wahola iSoviet leyincenye yemsebenti we-Apollo–Soyuz..."". This directly says Leonov led the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission.
"
Ngubani lolemele kulengoti?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngu-Gibson**.

The passage states ""Gibson waphutfunyiswa esibhedlela kodvwa wafa ngekushesha ngemva kwaloko,"" which translates to ""Gibson was rushed to the hospital but died shortly after that."" This clearly indicates that Gibson was injured in the accident. The passage specifically states that the lorry driver was unharmed. While the children were upset, there's no mention of them being physically injured.
"
Kwentekeni kulabantfu lababandzakanyeke kulengoti?,"The correct answer is **B: Munye bekangakalimali, munye ufile**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that Gibson died after being taken to the hospital.

"
Bososayensi labasebenta kuleluhlelo bebanelitsemba lekubona imphumelelo lebangwa ngukuphi kulokulandzelako?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Indzaba lemnyama (Dark matter)**.

The passage explicitly states that the simulation was designed to model the interaction between dark matter in the Sagittarius galaxy and dark matter in the Milky Way, with the desired effect being caused by the changing gravitational forces between them.
"
Bososayensi bebabukisisa indzaba yakuphi kulokulandzelako?,"Based on the provided text, the scientists were investigating the relationship between the Sagittarius galaxy and the Milky Way (which is also referred to as ""Mtsambo Wetinkhanyeti""). The text specifically mentions how the Milky Way influences the Sagittarius galaxy, similar to how a magnet affects the Earth.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: I-Sagittarius galaxy kanye neMtsambo Wetinkhanyeti**.
"
"Ngalokusekelwe kulendzima, yini lengagcekwa bagcini bemtsetfo?","The correct answer is **C: Bobani labaniketwa tinkontileka tekwakha kabusha**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions ""kusolwa lokubanti ngemitamo yekwakha kabusha igcile ngekuniketa ngetinkontileka tekwakha kabusha kulabo lababukile labangekhetsi eWashington."" This directly points to concerns about *who* received the reconstruction contracts.
*   The other options are somewhat related but not the primary focus of the criticism highlighted in the passage:
    *   A: Imali yekusita: The money is the root of this problem because there is an investigation of what happened with the money
    *   B: Kweswela kwemzamo wekwakha kabusha: While there might be implicit criticisms of the overall reconstruction effort, the *main* concern is about contract allocation.
    *   D: Imali yekwakha kabusha: This is related, but the passage's *specific* accusation is about *how* that money was being distributed (i.e., who got the contracts).

Therefore, C is the most accurate answer."
Ngubani logceka emakontileka ekwakha kabusha kwemizamo yekusita ye-Hurricane Katrina?,"The correct answer is **D: Labaphakatsi e-washington**.

The passage states that the criticism of the rebuilding efforts centers around awarding reconstruction contracts to ""insiders with connections in Washington."" This means people who are close to or have influence within the Washington political scene were benefiting from these contracts.
"
"Ngekusho kwesicephu, tibani letivela emkhatsini kwe-Stardust titobonakala kuphi kucala?","The correct answer is **B: Enyakatho ye-California**.

The passage states: ""kulindzeleke kutsi yente letibukwako kubantfu baseNyakatfo neCalifornia, e-Oregon, eNevada, kanye nase-Utah."" and later ""Itawundlula ngenhla kwelugu laseningizimu neCalifornia bese ikhanyisa sibhakabhaka phakatsi ne-Oregon ichubekele eNevada nase-Idaho iye e-Utah,"". This indicates that Northern California is the first location where the sightings are expected.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, umkhumbi-mkhatsi utocopha umlandvo wakuphi kulokulandzelako?","The correct answer is **C: Kubuyela emhlabeni ngekuphutfuma lokukhulu**.

The passage explicitly states: ""IStardust itobeka lirikhodi lelisha ngekuba ngumshini loya enyangeni losheshako kubuya eMhlabeni, iphula lirikhodi lelabekwa ngeNkhwenkhweti yanga-1969 ngesikhatsi kubuya i-Appolo X command module."" This directly indicates a record for the fastest return to Earth.
"
Uhlobene njani Dkt Malar Balasubramanian Ku-Saroja Balasubramaniam?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndvodzakati**.

The passage states that the body found in the trunk of the car was that of Saroja Balasubramanian, and the doctor accused of murder is Dr. Malar Balasubramanian. The passage indicates that Saroja Balasubramanian is Dr. Malar Balasubramanian's mother (""make"").
"
Watfolakala kuphi umtimba waSara Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Ebhuthini yemoto**.

The passage states: ""Lapho batfole umtimba waSaroja Balasubramanian, loneminyaka lengu-53, umbonywe ngetingubo letinengati. Emaphoyisa atsi lomtimba kubonakala shengatsi bowulapho cishe lilanga linye."" which translates to ""There, they found the body of Saroja Balasubramanian, 53 years old, covered with bloody clothes. Police said the body appeared to have been there for about a day.""
"
Yini letholwe I-eBay?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The passage states that eBay plans to leverage Skype's strong presence in regions like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil. This implies that eBay previously owned Skype and is now planning to separate from it.
"
Yini lefuna kukuzuza i-eBay ngalokutsenga?,"The passage mentions eBay's plan to diversify its revenue streams and gain recognition in regions where Skype has a strong presence. This directly implies that eBay aims to **expand into new territories**.

"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani longazange achumane netiboshwa letisala egcekeni ngemuva kwekulwa?","The correct answer is **D: Tisebenti tasesibhedlela**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions:
    *   Negotiators (""Labacocisani"") trying to resolve the situation.
    *   Police (""Emaphoyisa"") entering the yard and containing the prisoners.
    *   Firefighters (""Labacisha umlilo"") extinguishing the fire.
    *   Injured inmates being taken to the hospital (""Labalimele bamikiswe esibhedlela"")

The passage does not say hospital staff interacted directly with the prisoners remaining in the yard.
"
Ngukuphi kwalokulandzelako lokubangekutsi tiboshwa tihlehle kulesiphitsiphitsi?,"The correct answer is **B: Lisisi lelikhalisa tinyembeti**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that police wearing riot gear entered the yard and contained the inmates with **tear gas**. This directly implies that tear gas was used to control the situation, causing the inmates to retreat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tingcoco letiyimphumelelo (Successful negotiations):** The passage explicitly says that the negotiators were *not* successful in communicating with the inmates.
*   **C: Tiboshwa letilimele (Injured inmates):** While some inmates were injured, their injuries led to them being taken to the hospital, the passage does not say if it caused the riot to end.
*   **D: Ngumlilo (Fire):** The fire was part of the disturbance, not the cause of the inmates retreating."
"Ngekwembono wa-Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, yini lekufanele live lase-Iran litikhulule kuko?","The correct answer is **D: Kuncika emafutseni**.

The passage states: ""Umholi lomkhulu welive Ayatollah Khamenei uchaze kwenta oyili litsemba lelive ngekutsi kusitsiyo. Utsi loku bekusolo kuyinkhinga kusukela kusengakenteki ingucuko yeMasulumane nga 1979. Utse lelive kumelwe litikhulule kulenkhinga.""

This directly translates to the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei describing the country's reliance on oil as a problem and stating that the country must free itself from this problem. Therefore, the answer is reliance on oil.
"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, ngubani lowavumela emnotweni wase-Iran?","The correct answer is **D: Inyonyana yase-Europe**.

The passage states that the sanctions included a European Union ban on buying oil, and that oil sales account for eighty percent of Iran's economy. Therefore, the European Union's actions directly impacted the Iranian economy.
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo incenye yenchubo yekuvota kwaseFrance?,"The correct answer is **D: Emavoti abalwa ngulabamele lukhetfo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions clear ballot boxes.
*   The passage specifically mentions signing on the electoral roll.
*   The passage specifically mentions that travelers can send representatives to witness the entire process."
Bantfu labavotako babakhombisa kuphi bantfu lababakhetsile?,"The correct answer is **B: Ephepheni leseliphrintiwe ngaphambili**

The passage states that voters ""faka liphepha leliprintiwe lelishoko kutsi bavotela bani emvilophini."" (put a pre-printed paper saying who they are voting for in an envelope). This makes B the correct answer.
"
Yini leyaholela Allen kutsi acele kutfungatsa ema-Musashi iminyaka lesiphohlongo?,"The best answer is **D: Inshisakalo yakhe empini**.

The passage states Allen started the search for the Musashi because of a ""lifelong fascination with war."" While his wealth and investment in ocean exploration enabled the search, the *reason* he started it was his interest in war.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lena Allen lasebentise kuyo imali yakhe leningi?","The correct answer is **B: Kuhlola lulwandle**.

The passage states that ""Allen kwabikwa kutsi umcebo wakhe lomningi wawu-investela luhlolo lwetelwandle"".
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungenteka kuholele etimeni letiyingoti phakatsi nasedvute kwesitjalo?","Based on the passage, the following led to the dangerous conditions:

*   **A: Emafutsa e-Uranium** - The passage states ""imiphongolo lephetse oyela we-uranium lapho ugcinwa khona udzabukile kantsi uyavuta."" This directly indicates a problem with the uranium oil containers leaking and potentially burning.
*  **D: I-lodine** - The passage says ""...imisebe legijima ngesivinini kanye ne-ayodini kutfolakele kutsi kusuka etitjalweni."" indicating that Iodine is a harmful component that is being released.

While the white smoke is mentioned, it's a symptom or indicator of the problem, not the root cause. Caesium is not mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, the best answers are **A and D**.
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokungasiyo lenye yemathiphu ekuphepha laphakamiswe kubahlali bendzawo kulandzela sigameko lesenteke kulesikhungo?,"Impendvulo lengiyo ngu **C: Gwema kuhogela intutfu lemhlophe.**

Lesigatjana sikhuluma ngendlela lesingatitsetsebenta ngayo kulesimo:
*   Hlala etindlini (B: Hlala phakatsi)
*   Cima ema-air-conditioner (A: Gwema kusebentisa emayunithi emoya)
*   Unganatsi emanti asepompini (D: Gwema kunatsa emanti empompini)

Lesigatjana asitjho kutsi bantfu kufanele bagweme kuhogela intfutfu lemhlophe. Ngako-ke, imphendvulo lengiyo ngu C."
"Ngekwa Dtk. Moll, yini lekhatsata kakhulu mayelana ne-XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **D: Lizinga lekufa lelisetulu**.

The passage states: ""Dkt. Moll ucabanga kutsi letinye tiguli tisitfole esibhedlela lesifo, lokungenani lababili bekutisebenti tasesibhedlela. Ngemnyaka umuntfu lonesifo angase atselele bantfu labangu-10 kuya kulabangu-15 lake waba nabo. Kodvwa, emaphesenti eXDR-TB kulolonkhe licembu lebantfu labanesifuba sengati solo libukeka lilincane; ti-6,000 telinani lebantfu labati-330,000 labatselekile kunoma ngusiphi skhatsi eNingizumu Afrikha. ""Ngesikhulumi leyingcoco utsite lesifo lesisha lesicishe sifane nesangaphambili """"siyinkinga nakakhulu futsi siyakhatsata ngenca yelinani lelikhulu lesibulala ngalo.""""

This clearly indicates that Dr. Moll is most concerned about the high death rate associated with XDR-TB. The other options are mentioned in the text, but the *reason* for his concern is the high mortality.
"
Tingaki tigulane letitfole ikontileka lesha leticinisekisiwe kutsi titisebenti tetemphilo?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**

The passage states: ""Dkt. Moll ucabanga kutsi letinye tiguli tisitfole esibhedlela lesifo, lokungenani lababili bekutisebenti tasesibhedlela.""
"
Hlobo muni webuchwephesha lolusebentiswa luhlelo lwe-NextGen?,"The correct answer is **A: Buchwepheshe lobusekelwe kusethelayithi**

The passage states directly: ""Isebentisa buchwepheshe lobusisekelo besethelayithi..."" which translates to ""It uses satellite-based technology..."".
"
Ingabe i-NextGen ibazuzisa njani balawuli bekuphitsitela kwetindiza?,"Based on the passage, the best answer is **B: Indzawo yendiza lenembe kakhudlwana**

Here's why:

*   The passage states NextGen ""ivumela umoya kutsi ucondzise tindiza futsi unikete bashayeli betindiza umniningwane loliciniso."" (allows air to guide aircraft and gives pilots accurate information). This directly implies more accurate aircraft location information for air traffic controllers.
* While NextGen leads to shorter routes (A), reduced carbon emissions (C), and less fuel (D), the passage highlights NextGen's use of satellite-based technology to give pilots accurate information, thus impacting the air traffic controller's job.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, yini lengazange igcekwe tatimlandvo i-FBI ngekugcila kuyo?","The correct answer is **A: Kukhulisa lizinga lempumelelo yabo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the FBI is criticized for focusing *too much* resources on solving minor crimes to *increase* their success rate. So, increasing their success rate is *not* something they were criticized for *not* doing, but rather criticized for doing *in a way that was perceived as wasteful*.

The other options are directly mentioned as areas the FBI was criticized for focusing on:

*   **B:** is another minor crime that was mentioned and criticized for focusing resources on.
*   **C:** Focusing a lot on child pornography cases: Congress specifically directed the FBI to allocate resources to these cases.

The passage states: ""Imibiko yemaphephandzaba ibike ngemoto yemlilo **legicikile** ngesikhatsi iya endzaweni lokwenteke kuyo ingoti."" (Newspaper reports reported about a fire truck **rolling over** while on its way to the accident site.)
"
"Kulandzela kushayisa kwe-JAS 39C Gripen, siteshi setindiza besivalelwe ini?","The correct answer is **A: Tindiza tekutsengiselana**.

The passage states ""...kwavalwa lesikhungo setindiza kundizela temsebenti"" which translates to ""...the airport was closed to commercial flights"".
"

The passage states that Brzezinski advised Carter on foreign policy during the 1976 election and then served as his National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981. Since the Iranian Revolution happened in 1979, during his time as NSA for Carter, he would have been advising Carter.
"
Ngubani lobambe sikhundla sekuba ngumeluleki wetekuphatsa Eveni lonkhe kwaze kwaba ngu-1977?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngu-Kissinger**.

The passage states that Brzezinski became NSA in 1977, *succeeding* Henry Kissinger. This means Kissinger held the position before him.
"

**A: Ushaye emagoli langetulu kulangu-468 ngesikhatsi adlalela licembu**

Lendzaba itsi Bobek washaya emagoli langu-403 emidlalweni lengu-468, hhayi kutsi washaya emagoli langetulu kulangu-468. Letinye tintfo letishiwo ngemsebenti wakhe nalesikhungo ticiniseke ngalokungiyo ngoba tidzingida tintfo lokukhulunywe ngato kulendzaba.
"
Ngusiphi sitatimende lesimayelanne nemlandvo wa-Bokek ne-Partizan Belgrade lesiliciniso?,"The correct answer is **A: Ucale kudlalela i-Partizan nga-1945**

Here's why:

*   **A: Ucale kudlalela i-Partizan nga-1945** - The passage explicitly states, ""Wabajoyina nga-1945 futsi wahlala kwaze kwaba ngu-1958"" (He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958). This is true.
*   **B: Wadlalela i-Zagreb ngaphambi kwe-Partizan Belgrade** - The passage only states that he was *born* in Zagreb, but doesn't say that he played for them.
*   **C: Wadlalela i-Partizan kwadzimate kwaba ngu-1995** - The passage states that he played for Partizan from 1945 to 1958.
*   **D: Utfole ludvumo ngemuva kwekuvotelwa njengemdlali lovelele we-Partizan** - The passage states he gained fame while playing for Partizan, then was voted best player of all time for the team in 1995.
"
Ngekwendzima ngutiphi tici letihlukanisa iHesperonychus ku-Velociraptor?,"The passage states that Hesperonychus is related to Velociraptor, implying they share some traits. It also explicitly states Hesperonychus had a larger second toe claw, which is given as the meaning of the name *Hesperonychus*. Therefore, the key distinguishing feature mentioned in the passage is the size of the second toe claw.

So the answer is:

B: Eneluzipho lwesibili lolukhundlwana
"
Inchazelo ye”Hesperonychus” iniketwa ngutiphi tici letibonakalako tetinhlobo tetilwane?,"The correct answer is **A: Luzipho(s)**.

The passage states that the name ""Hesperonychus"" means ""western claw"" and refers to the distinctive claws of the animal, specifically the large second claw.
"
Ngutiphi titatimende letilandzelako letiliciniso mayelana nekudubula?,"The correct answer is **D: Kudubula kwenteke eBuffalo**.

Here's why:

*   The text states the couple came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and family and that the husband, a Buffalo native, was killed in the shooting. The location of the shooting is in Buffalo.
*   **A** is incorrect because while they got married in Texas, only the husband was born in Buffalo, the wife is from Texas.
*   **B** is incorrect because only four people were killed.
*   **C** is incorrect because they were married in Texas, not Buffalo."
Ngusiphi sitatimende lekungiso lesimayelana nendzawo lapho kwenteke khona sigameko sekudubulana?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwenteke emcimbini wekugubha iminyaka eBuffalo**.

The passage states that the couple came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and family, and that the husband was killed in a shooting. This implies the shooting happened at the celebration event in Buffalo.
"
Ngekusho kwendzima bekuyini kukhtsateka kwekucala phakatsi kwetikhulu mayelana ne-Luno?,"The correct answer is **A: Kusweleka kwemtfwalo wamanyolo**.

The passage states: ""...baphatsi bacala kukhatsateka kutsi lomkhumbi ungase uwuchitse lomthwalo."" This translates to ""captains began to worry that the ship might spill the cargo."" The cargo in question is described earlier as ""umtfwalo wemcuba,"" which means ""cargo of copper"". Option A, ""Kusweleka kwemtfwalo wamanyolo,"" means ""loss of the cargo of copper."" Therefore, this is the initial concern of the captains.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngutiphi kuletitatimende letilandzelako letingasilo liciniso mayelana nekuphuka kwe-Luno?","The correct answer is **B: Umkhumbi bowunemafutsa langemamitha langu-100 ngesikhatsi sekuphuka**.

Here's why:

* **A: Kuphuka kwenteke ngaphambi kwekutsatsa imphahla** - This is true. The passage states the ship was ""on its way to collect a cargo of copper.""
* **B: Umkhumbi bowunemafutsa langemamitha langu-100 ngesikhatsi sekuphuka** - This is false. The passage mentions a ""100-meter ship"" was *going* to collect cargo. The passage mentions the Luno contained 120-160 cubic meters of gasoline. The length of the Luno ship isn't included
* **C: Kwetisebenti letilishumi nakubili, kwalimala munye** - This is true. The passage indicates that 12 crew members were rescued with only one receiving a broken nose.
* **D: Umkhumbi waphoswa emantini lageletako** - This is true. The passage says ""the strong wind and waves pushed it into the flowing water.""

Therefore, option B is the statement that is NOT true.
"
Kuiphi lishumi leminyaka lapho i-Algeria yatfola khona imphumelelo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngo-1960s**.

The text states: ""Ngabo-1960 wabuyela emuva e-Algeria eveni lebeselitfole imvume yekutibusa kuze afundzise kucondzisa kudlalwa kwemafilimu."" This translates to: ""In the 1960s he returned to Algeria, a country that had gained independence, to teach directing filmmaking."" Therefore, Algeria gained independence in the 1960s.
"
Betikuphi tikilini tamabonakudze tingakalungiseleli umcimbi wemngcwabo?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Kulo lonkhe laseRome**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Bomabonakudze labanyenti labakhulu bafakiwe **etindzaweni letinyenti taseRoma** kuze bantfu babukele lombutsano."" (Many large television screens were installed **in many places in Rome** for people to watch the ceremony).
"
Wentelwe kuphi umcimbi wemgcwabo?,"The best answer is **C: E-St. Peter Square**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the funeral service was held at St. Peter's Square: ""...lomngcwabo eSt. Peter's Square"". While the passage mentions there were other viewing locations in Rome and other cities in Italy and Poland, the main funeral service was at St. Peter's Square."
"Kulandzela kuchuma, ngubani lowalashelwa kulimala lokubi?","The correct answer is **B: Kute namunye**.

The passage states that no serious injuries were reported (""Kute kulimala lokukhulu lokwabikwa""), and the five people treated were for shock (""bantfu labasihlanu labebakulendzawo ngesikhatsi salokuchuma balashelwa kwetfuka""). Shock is not the same as serious injury.
"
Ngubani lobike?,"Impendvulo lekulungile ngu **A: Makhelwane esakhuweni**

Umbiko utsi makhelwane bashaye lucingo futsi babika ngekuvuta kwagesi.
"

"
Sabani sikhali lesihluleke kudubula ngesikhatsi lesitsite ngesikhatsi sekuhlasela?,"Impendvulo lengiyo ngu **B: Sa-Uka**

Umbhalo utsi ""Sikhali sa-Uka sahluleka sibe sikhonjwe enhloko yendvodza yesihlanu"". Loku kusho kutsi sikhali sa-Uka ngiso lesingazange sisebente.
"
Ngiyiphi yalemidlalo lelandzelako leyavotelwa kutsi isuswe ehlelweni lema-Olympic?,"The correct answer is **C: I-Baseball**

The passage states ""baseball ne-softball, lekwavotelwa kutsi kuphume Emidlalweni yema-Olimpiki nga-2005."" This means baseball was voted to be removed from the Olympic Games.
"
Nguyiphi Yalemidlalo ldlandzelako levotelwe likomiti lavelonkhe kutsi liwufake kulemidlalo?,"The correct answer is **C: Inyonyana Yebhola lembhoco**.

The passage clearly states: ""I-rugby, ngalokukhetsekile inyonyane ye-rugby, negalufa yakhetfwa kunaleminye imidlalo lesihlanu lebeyibalelwe kudlalwa kuma-Olimpiki."" This directly indicates that rugby union was voted to be included.
"
Arthur Guinness ekucaleni wacashisa iSt James’ Gate iminyaka lemingaki?,"The correct answer is **D: 9000**.

The passage states that Arthur Guinness signed a 9,000-year lease.
"

The text states that Guinness makes ""over 10 billion euros (US$14.7 billion) annually"".  Therefore, the amount closest to the billion dollar figure is 14.
"
Mangaki emave e-European Union lakhonjiwe laneligciwane i-H5N1?,"The passage states ""Live laseFrance lesikhombisa emaveni aseYurophu Lehlangene kutsi lihlaselwe nguleligciwane; lilandzela i-Austria, iJalimane, Slovenia, iBulgaria, iGreece neTaliyane.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Sikhombisa** (Seven)
"
Likhonjwe kuphi licala lakamuva leligciwane i-H5N1?,"The correct answer is **A: France**.

The passage states that the H5N1 virus was confirmed to have killed a wild duck found near Lyon in eastern France. This is the most recently confirmed case mentioned in the passage.
"
Wagcina nini Haiti kuba nalesifo ngaphambi kwekusakateka lokubangwa masotja ekuthula?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngabo 1800**.

The passage states: ""Ngaphambi kwekutsi emabutfo emphi efike, iHaiti beyingakake yahlangabetana netinkinga letihlobene netifo kusukela nga-1800."" This directly translates to Haiti not experiencing cholera issues since the 1800s before the peacekeepers arrived.
"
Tibi letisuka kuyiphi indzawo letinemtselela ekubhebhetsekeni kwalesifo?,"The correct answer is **B: Enkambu i-UN**.

The passage states that the cholera outbreak was suspected to have started near the UN peacekeeping camp and that waste from the UN camp was not properly treated, leading to contamination of the Artibonite River.
"
Uhlele kwentani hulumende wase-Irish?,"The best answer is **C: Kunetseteka imitsetfo mayelana nekuvunyelwa kwetidzakamiva.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states the Irish government is emphasizing the *urgency* of passing legislation to address the situation.
*   The government spokesperson says it's important the law is applied *quickly* to both public health and law enforcement issues.
*   The health director is concerned about both individual health (related to temporary allowances) and the rise in drug-related crime since the allowances began.

All these points indicate the government wants to *legalize* (or at least *regulate*) drug allowances to address the issues.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Tigwebo letiniketwa labaphula umtsetfo wetidzakamiva:** While related, the main focus is on the legalization/regulation of allowances, not just punishing drug offenders.
*   **B: Kwethula imitsetfo lecinile mayelana nekuvunyelwa kwetidzakamiva:** The passage does not specifically mention that the laws will be stricter
*   **D: Kubandlulula tidzakamiva:** The passage doesn't indicate this. The focus is on finding a legal framework."
Yini lebeyisemtsetfweni kwesikhashana e-Ireland?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: Tidzakamiva**.

The passage states that the health official is concerned about the health of individuals benefiting from the ""temporary allowance"" of ""substances"" (which implies drugs) and about the drug-related crimes that have decreased since this ""now-illegal change"" started. This strongly suggests that drugs were temporarily legal.
"
Uphenyelwa ini umsolwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Kweca**.

The passage states: ""Christopher Garcia... utse lomboshwa wesilisa uyaphenywa ngelicala lekungena endzaweni lakangakavunyelwa kuyo kunelokulimata imphahla."" This directly translates to the person is being investigated for entering a place without permission rather than damaging property. ""Kungena endzaweni lakangakavunyelwa kuyo"" means entering a place where they weren't allowed, which is trespassing (Kweca). While the passage mentions the sign modification, the spokesperson specifically says they are being investigated for trespassing, *not* property damage.
"
"Uma ushintja luphawu, yini langakayenti umsolwa?","The correct answer is **C: Ilimate ngekwemtimba (Damage physically)**.

The passage states: ""Lesayini ayilimalanga"" which translates to ""The sign was not damaged"". The question asks what the suspect did *not* do, and the answer is physically damage the sign.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngukuphi kulokulandzdlako lobekumfundzisi wesingisi Karno langasolwa ngako?","The correct answer is **C: Kuphrinta tikhangiso letingakagunyatwa** (Printing unauthorized advertisements).

The passage explicitly states: ""Imfundvo yanamuhla imsole ngeku-printa tikhangiso atifake emabhasini ngaphandle kwemvumo..."" (Modern Education accused him of printing advertisements and putting them on buses without permission).

While the other options are mentioned in the passage, they are not *accusations* made by Modern Education.
*   A (Kuphulwa kwe-copyright) was a past accusation that didn't result in a penalty.
*   B (Kutsandzana nemfundzi) is implied by the student's statement that he was ""umngani webafundzi"" (a friend of the students), but not an explicit accusation in the passage.
*   D (Kusebentisa lulimi lolungcolile ekilasini) is mentioned as a report, but not a direct accusation from Modern Education.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani longakathunjwa nguRonald Mendoza?","The correct answer is **B: Liphoyisa**.

The passage states that Rolando Mendoza, a former Filipino police officer, took tourists from Hong Kong hostage. The only option that was not taken hostage by Ronaldo Mendoza is Option B, the Police.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubaphi labathunjiwe labangakacinisekiswa kutsi bakhululwe ngaphambi kwesikhatsi?","The correct answer is **A: Letivakashi**.

The passage states that many of the hostages were rescued, but ""at least six are dead *so far*."" This implies that not all of the tourists were confirmed to be rescued or dead.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, ngubani lococa imisayino kute asekele kushada ngebulili lobufanako eBrasil?","The correct answer is **A: Bafaki tikhalo** (Babhikishi).

The passage states that ""Babhikishi betsemba kutsi batawukoleka sikhalo setigidzi letingu-1.2 kuze basetfule Engcungcutseleni Yelive Lonkhe ngaNovember."" This translates to: ""Protesters hope to collect 1.2 million signatures to present to the National Congress in November."" Thus, the protesters are the ones collecting signatures.
"
Babhikishi batasiniketa bani sicelo sabo?,"The correct answer is **C: Khongolose Wavelonkhe waseBrasil**.

The passage states: ""Babhikishi betsemba kutsi batawukoleka sikhalo setigidzi letingu-1.2 kuze basetfule Engcungcutseleni Yelive Lonkhe ngaNovember.""  ""Engcungcutseleni Yelive Lonkhe"" translates to ""National Congress"" in English. Therefore, the protesters hope to present their petition to the National Congress of Brazil.
"
"Ngekusho kwa-Armand Versace, yini leyenteka ngaphambi kwekutsi sicuku sicale kusabela esimeni selitulu?","The correct answer is **C: Kwaba nemoya lonemandla**.

The passage states: ""ngemuva kwemzuzu lowodvwa, lomoya bowugijima ngesivinini lesingu 70km/h..."" which translates to ""after about one minute, the wind was blowing at a speed of 70km/h..."". This indicates a strong wind preceded the hailstorm and the crowd's reaction.
"
"Ngekusho kwaVersace, ucale nini umoya lonemandla?","The correct answer is **A: Imizuzu lembalwa ngemuva kwekutsi sicale siboni**

Here's why:

The quote says ""Ngemizuzu nje lesihlanu, kucale kuhhusha, cishe ngemuva kwemzuzu lowodvwa, lomoya bowugijima ngesivinini lesingu 70km/h"" which translates to: ""Just five minutes after it started drizzling, almost a minute later, the wind was blowing at a speed of 70km/h...""

Therefore, the strong wind started a few minutes (roughly five) after the drizzle began.
"
"Ngaphambi kwaFred, tingaki tivunguvungu letikhulu letirekhodiwe eMpumalanga ya-35°?","The passage states that Fred is the ""third strongest hurricane ever reported east of 35°W"". This means there were two hurricanes stronger than it before Fred.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Kubili** (Two).
"
"Lapho Fred asedvute nsichingi saseCape Verde, bekacondze ngakuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Enshonalanga**.

The passage states that Siphepho, lebesisendzaweni lechele ngemamayela langaba ngu-645 (1040 km) enshonalanga yesichingi saseCape Verde (The storm was located approximately 645 miles (1040 km) west of the Cape Verde islands).
"
Ngukuphi kulokulandzelako lokunesivinini lesisheshako kunetindvuleli tayo?,"The answer is **A: Ngu-802.11n**

The passage states that 802.11n has a significantly higher speed of up to 600Mbit/s. Therefore, it's faster than its predecessors (802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g).
"
Yini ledzingekako kute i-802.11n ibuyele emuva ihambisane ne-802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: Umsakato lokabili (Dual radio)**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Loku kutayivumela kutsi isebentisane ne-802.11a, 802.11b kanye ne-802.11g, kulandzela kutsi siteshi lesiyinhloko sinemisakato lemibili."" (This will allow it to work with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, provided the main station has two radios.)

This directly implies that the dual radio is the key requirement for backwards compatibility with older standards like 802.11b.  The 802.11n access point needs a radio capable of operating on the 2.4 GHz band (where 802.11b operates) in addition to a radio that can use either the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sivinini lesishesheko kakhulu (The fastest speed):** While 802.11n is faster, speed isn't *why* it's backwards compatible. Backwards compatibility is about supporting older communication protocols.
* **B: Likhono le-802.11b lekusebenta ku-5.0Ghz (The ability of 802.11b to operate at 5.0Ghz):** 802.11b cannot operate at 5.0 GHz. This is false.
* **C: Kuphuma kwe-600Mbit/s (600Mbit/s throughput):** While 802.11n *can* achieve this speed, it's not the reason it can be compatible with older standards.  The ability to achieve 600 Mbps throughput does not create backwards compatibility.

Therefore, the existence of the dual radio is what allows the 802.11n access point to communicate with devices using the older 802.11b standard.
"
Mingaki imicimbi lapho umhlomuli wendondi yegolide wema-Olympics lobekumele abhukute kuyo imidlalo yemphakatsi?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuhlanu**.

Here's the breakdown:

Total: 1 + 1 + 3 = 5
"
Kungani lowazuza imedali  yeligolide kuma-Olympics angazange anatse umutsi wetinhlungu takhe?,"The correct answer is **D: Akukavunyelwa kuma-Commonwealth Games**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...njengoba angakavunyelwa kuLomdlalo."" which translates to ""...as it has not been approved for the Games.""
"
"Ngekusho kwalendzima, ingabe yini leyaholela ekudzidzekeni mayelana nesehlakalo sekutamatama kwemhlaba?","The correct answer is **A: Kuba khona kwemafu lamnyama**.

The passage states that ""Lamafu aletse litfuba lekudideka kutsi noma kuchuma kwenteke mbamba yini."" This directly links the presence of the dark clouds to the potential confusion about whether an eruption (or, more broadly, a geological event) actually occurred.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, kuvela nini kugucuka kwesigaba?","The correct answer is **C: Ngeti 10 Indlovulenkhulu** (March 10).

The passage states: ""Lokutamatama kwemhlaba lokuphumele emonakalweni kwenteka nga-March 10 enyakatfolesemphumalanga yalapho kwaba khona nekucubuka kweludzaka lolushisako.""
"
Ngutiphi titatimende letilandzelako mayelana neluphenyo le-Chandrayaan-1’s letingasilo liciniso?,"The statement that is NOT true based on the provided text is:

*   **D: Luphenyo belupentiwe ehlongotsini**

**Explanation:**

The text states that the lunar lander (the Moon Impact Probe, MIP) had an image of the Indian flag painted on all sides, not that the probe itself was painted."
Ngutiphi titatimende letilandzelako letichaza ngalokungiko luphenyo lwenyanga?,"The correct answer is **B: Kushayiseka kwekufika kube imphumelelo**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Yehla dvutane nesigcobo Enyakatho yeNyanga:** The text explicitly states it landed *near the south pole*.
*   **C: Yakhishwa ku-orbiter lenebentfu:** The text says it was deployed from the *Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter*, which is uncrewed.
*   **D: Beyitfwele emathulusi lamabili labalulekile:** The text says it carried *three* important scientific payloads.
*   **B: Kushayiseka kwekufika kube imphumelelo:** The text says ""...and successfully crash-landed near the Moon's south pole"". This directly supports this statement."
"Ngalokusekelwe endzimeni, ngusiphi silinganiso lesisebentiswa ekugcineni sekuvikela lesifo?","The correct answer is **D: Emakhethini etimbuzulwane**.

The passage states: ""...kusakatwe tinkhulungwane tetintfo letikuvikela etimbuzulwaneni..."" which directly translates to distributing thousands of mosquito nets as a preventative measure. While the passage mentions other actions, the distribution of mosquito nets is the specific preventative measure described in the text.
"
Sindlulela njani ebantfwini lesifo?,"The correct answer is **A: Timbuzulwane**.

The passage states that if a mosquito bites an infected pig and then bites a person, the person can contract the disease. This clearly indicates that mosquitoes are the vector for transmission to humans.
"
Kuhluleka kwesigwebo sesibili kungaholela kumuphi umphumela?,"The correct answer is **B: Lilungelo lakusasa letinyonyana tebulili lobufanako**.

The passage states that the failure of the second sentence (which proposed banning same-sex civil unions) ""could allow for civil unions to be approved over time."" This directly supports option B.
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, sisuswe nini sigwebo sesibili?","The correct answer is **C: Ngemsombuluko**.

The passage states ""...kwendluliselwa ngendlela lefanako yi-Senate ngeMsombuluko,"" which translates to ""...passed in a similar way by the Senate on Monday."" This refers to the removal/passing of the second sentence.
"
Aputjutelwe kubani “emaphepha asePanama”?,"The correct answer is **B: Betindzba**.

The passage states that the ""Panama Papers"" resulted in news stories in the spring of 2016, implying they were leaked to the press (betindzba).
"
"Ngekusho kwendzima, Ngubani lowatse batindzaba baseBritish bekaphetse tinkampani letiningi letisebentiselwa kufihla Umcebo?","The correct answer is **C: I-Deutsche Bank**.

The passage states: ""Liphephandzaba laseBritish i-The Guirdian lisikisele kutsi Libhange leDeutsche lilawulwe cishe nguyinye kuletintsatfu tetinkapane teShell letingu 1200 letisentjentiselwe kwenta loku.""  This means The Guardian suggested Deutsche Bank controlled a significant portion of the shell companies used for hiding wealth.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A**."
Ngukuphi lokulandzelako lokungasiso sizatfu sebunyenti betingoti temoya letenteka e-Iran?,"The correct answer is **D: Ingcogco yetindiza letinganakekelwa kahle.**

Here's why:

*   **A, B, and C are directly stated or implied:** The passage mentions old civilian and military airplanes, restrictions on buying new planes due to sanctions, and consequently, poorly maintained aircraft.
*   **D** while related to the issues described in the passage, the correct word is **kutinakekela**, while the option says **ingcogco**
"
Nguyiphi kuletilandzelako lengakafakwa embikweni weLicembu Lekufundza lase-Iraq?,"Let's analyze the provided text and the answer choices:

*   **The passage states:**
    *   The report calls for debate and consensus in the US. (Supports D)
    *   The report criticizes current administration policy. (Supports A)
    *   The report contains 78 recommendations. (Supports C).
    *   The report warns that the factors leading to the Iraq war may not end.

*   **Answer Choice B:** ""Simemetelo sekutsi ngetingucuko letitsite, ludlame lolukhulako e-Iraq lungagwenywa"" (A declaration that with certain changes, increased violence in Iraq can be avoided). The report **warns** that nothing guarantees violence ending or escalating. It doesn't definitively state that increased violence *can* be avoided with changes, but it does suggest change is necessary. However, the implication is that the changes are an *attempt* to avoid escalating violence, not a guarantee.

Therefore, the answer is **B**."

The report does **not** explicitly recommend ""kutsi kumemetelwe siciniseko sekumisa ludlame lolukhulako"" (declaring an end to escalating violence). While the report clearly aims to reduce violence, it focuses on preventing genocide and building relationships, rather than a simple declaration.

This implies that *clarity* in the constitution is being used as a reason to cancel the runoff."
Kungani emancusa agcina atsatse lukhetfo njengalolungadzingeki?,"The best answer is **C: Bekunekungacaci kahle kumtsetfo sisekelo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""Bosomachinga batsi batfole incazelo leyanele yemtsetfosisekelo wase-Afghan kutewuchata ngelukhetfo lolungenasidzingo."" This means there was initially some uncertainty or lack of clarity in the constitution that allowed the engineers to see that the election was unnecessary.

*The other options:

* A: Luphambene nemtsetfo sisekelo - The passage states that the opposite was initially claimed.
* B: Kube netingoti tekuphepha - While security is mentioned as a reason to cancel the runoff, it's not the reason the engineers found the election unnecessary.

*   **B: Sikhumulo setindzisa lesise-Ishikawa:** The passage says the Noto Airport in Ishikawa is closed.

"
"Kulandzela umcudzelwane lokukhulunye ngawo kulesicephu, Kahne unemaphuzu lamangaki kuloMcudzelwane Webashayeli?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The passage states: ""Kahne naTruex, Jr. basendzaweni yesihlanu neyesitfupha ngekulandzelana ngemaphuzu langu-2,220 nalangu-2,207."" This clearly indicates Kahne has 2,220 points.

"Ngekwalesicephu, kukangakhi bantfu babona emateja lawa esibhakabhakeni futsi kamuva abonakala kutsi avela ku-Mars?","The correct answer is **B: Tikhatsi letisihlanu**.

The passage states: ""Kukholelwa kutsi sikhatsi sesihlanu emlandvweni kutsi bantfu bakhumbule loko lokushintje kwaba yikhemikhali lecinisisekisiwe lewele eMhlabeni."" This directly translates to ""It is believed to be the fifth time in history that humans have witnessed something that turned out to be a confirmed Martian meteorite falling to Earth.""
"
"Njengobe kushiwo esiceshini, ngukuphi lokuliciniso ngematje latfolakele kutsi avela ku-Mars?","The correct answer is **D: Kunalangu-34 awo**

*   The passage states ""Kulamatje lati-24,000 lekutsiwa ngema-meteorotes latiwako lawela emhlabeni, angema-34 kuphela lokwacinisekiswa kutsi avela kulenye iplanethi.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Onkhe atfolakele nga-July ngesikhatsi kubukwa ematje lawa esibhakabhakeni** - While 15 *new* martian meteorites were found, it doesn't mean all 34 were.

*   **C: Angabita imali lengu-$11,000 kwendlula ligolide** - The passage states they can cost $11,000-$22,500 *per ounce*, which is about ten times the price of gold, not $11,000 more expensive than gold."

Here's why:

*   **P** states that AOL's dominance in the IM market is due to its large user base in America. It then suggests that Yahoo and Microsoft combined could challenge AOL's user base.
*   **Q** asks how this situation would affect AOL.
*   Answer choice **C** indicates that the user base of AOL would be equal to the combined user bases of Yahoo and Microsoft, which directly relates to the information that it provides in the argument.

The other choices are not relevant:

*   **A:** The text implies AOL's user base could be threatened, not grow.
*   **B:** The text suggests other companies could challenge AOL, not that AOL would be the only one developing the IM market.
*   **D:** The text doesn't suggest AOL will disappear from America, only that its dominance could be challenged."
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungase kucephele ngemuva kwaloluhlelo lolusha?,"The correct answer is **C: Inkhululeko ye-AOL yekutfutfukisa imakethe ngelitubile layo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that AOL's dominance allowed it freedom in developing the IM market.
*   The passage then says that the combined user base of Yahoo and Microsoft could rival AOL's.
*   This implies that AOL's freedom to develop the market at its own pace could be threatened because it will face greater competition from Yahoo and Microsoft, therefore no longer having the same freedom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kutfutfukiswa lokwandzako kwe-inthanethi eMelika:** While increased competition in the IM market could *potentially* contribute to internet development, it's not the direct and immediate consequence implied by the passage.
*   **B: Labasebentisa imakethe ye-IM:** The passage focuses on AOL's potential loss of freedom in developing the market due to competition, not necessarily a change in the number of users.
*   **D: Kuhlangana kwe-Yahoo ne-Microsoft:** The passage refers to the *combined* users of Yahoo and Microsoft, but not an actual merger of the companies themselves. A merger would be an assumption beyond what the passage states."

The passage states that the show ""bewuvetwa kuphela kuwayilesi ye-inthanethi lebitwa ngekutsi yiTogiNet Radio"" before 2015. The other options are not correct as the show was broadcasted at the TogiNet radio before 2015 and only later was AstroNet Radio established.
"

The passage states the website describes the show as ""njengaloyo wasewayilesini yakadzani lohambisana nalokutsite lokusha lokumangalisako!"", which translates to ""like the old radio but with something new and amazing!"".

The text states: ""Nadal utfole emaphoyinti langemaphesenti langema-88 sekaphelele kulomdlalo wawina emaphoyinti langema-76 ekucaleni nje.""  This directly translates to: ""Nadal got 88 percent of the points overall in the match, winning 76 points just in the beginning.""

The passage states: ""Labangu-45 kulabangu 117 kulomdlalo lobewuseGiant Slalom behlulekile kuniketwa sigaba sabo kulomcudzelwano."" This means 45 people in the Giant Slalom failed to finish.
"
Ngumaphi emavi kulawa lalandzelako layiveta kahle imiphumela yeMcudzelwane?,"Let's analyze each option based on the information provided in the text:

*   **A: Emcudzelwaneni wesibili, Carpenado uphume embili kwemntjuzi wase-Hungary** This is incorrect. The text states Carpenado was 1:09.02 behind the Hungarian athlete.

*   **B: Labantjuzako labangu-45 abacedzanga ku-Giant Slalom** This is correct. The text says ""labangu-45 kulabangu 117 kulomdlalo lobewuseGiant Slalom behlulekile kuniketwa sigaba sabo kulomcudzelwano,"" meaning 45 didn't finish.

*   **C: Labantjuzako labengetiwe bayicedzile i-Giant Slalom kune-Slalom** To evaluate this, we need to compare finishers. In Slalom, 36 of 116 failed to finish, meaning 116 - 36 = 80 finished. In Giant Slalom, 45 of 117 failed to finish, meaning 117 - 45 = 72 finished. Thus, fewer athletes completed the Giant Slalom compared to the Slalom. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

*   **D: Carpenado uphumelele esigabeni selishumi ku-Slalom** This is incorrect. The text states that Carpanedo did not finish the Slalom race. She finished tenth in Giant Slalom.

**Therefore, the correct answer is B: Labantjuzako labangu-45 abacedzanga ku-Giant Slalom**"

Here's why:

*   The passage states that after Northern Rock was nationalized in 2010, it was split into a ""good bank"" (Northern Rock plc) and a ""bad bank"" (Northern Rock (Asset Management)). It then says that Virgin bought the ""good bank.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I-Virgin Group nayo itsenge inkampani yekulawula imphahla ye-Northen Rock:** The passage explicitly says that Virgin *didn't* buy the asset management company (""i-Virgin itsenge kuphela """"lelibhange lelikahle"""" laseNyakatfo Rock, hhayi lenkapane yekuphatsa imphahla."")
*   **C: I-Virgin Group inikete lelibhange lusito loluphutfumako ngesikhatsi senkinga yesikweleti sekutsenga indzawo:** The passage states the government of the UK gave the bailout, not Virgin.
*   **D: I-Virgin Group yalibhidela kwekucala lelibhange ngemuva kwekutsi lifakwe ngephansi kwahulumende:** The passage mentions that Virgin bid on the bank *before* it was nationalized (""Licembu laSir Richard Branson lelibitwa ngekutsi yiVirgin Group belilibhidele lelibhange kodvwa sicelo salo sangaphumeleli ngaphambi kwekutsi hulumende alitsatse lelibhange."")

Ngumaphi emavi langakuveti kahle kulawulwa kwetinambutane lokuzanywako?,"The answer is **A: Njengobe loluhlelo belwetanywa kwekucala, aluzange luhlolwe**.

Here's why:

*   **P clearly states that the trial was ""bukelwe nekuphumelela kwalo kuhlolwa"" (observed and its success evaluated).** This directly contradicts option A, which says it wasn't evaluated.
*   The other options are all directly supported by the passage:
    *   **B: Labadubulako batfola ticondziso tekuceceshwa (Shooters received safety training guidelines):** The passage states ""bacibisheli labane labakhetsiwe kulokucibishela kwekucala batfole ticondziso tekuceceshwa ngekuphepha.""
    *   **C: Labadubulako bebacondziswa bogadzi (Shooters were overseen by rangers):** The passage mentions ""Bantfu labadubulako kuloluhlolo lekulawula tilokatana bekufanele bagadvwe ngulabo labagadza tilwane"" which implies rangers were overseeing the shooters.
    *   **D: Kwakhetfwa labadubulako labane (Four shooters were selected):** The passage states ""bacibisheli labane labakhetsiwe kulokucibishela kwekucala."""

"
Yni lengashiwongo embikweni wekucala wenhlangano lensha ye-Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **B: Lendiza ayivunyelwanga kutsi ihlale ngalokuphutfumako**.

Here's why:

* **A: Lendiza yatfunjwa:** The first report (from Xinhua) *did* mention the plane was hijacked.
* **C: Lendiza yaphambukiswa yabuyiselwa e-Afghanistan:** The updated reports say the plane was diverted back to Afghanistan. Since this information is in the *updated* reports, it must not have been in the *initial* Xinhua report.
* **D: Lendiza isongelwe ngebhomu:** The updated reports mentioned a bomb threat. Thus, this information wasn't in the initial report.

Option B is not a consequence of information provided in the original or updated information.
"
Yini leyamenyetelwa nguSara Danius eluhlelweni lwewayilesi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ikomidi itokuma kwenta imetamo yekuchumana naBob Dylan**.

The passage states that Sara Danius announced that the committee had stopped trying to contact Bob Dylan directly about winning the Nobel Prize.
"
Ngubani lokungafinyelelwanga kuye?,"The correct answer is **D: NguBob Dylan**.

The passage explicitly states that the committee was unable to reach Bob Dylan directly.
"
Ngubani lophawule watsi lesitsembiso “sisinyatselo lesikhulu”?,"The correct answer is **C: NguGordon Johndroe**.

The passage states: ""Lokhulumela iBush, Gordon Johndroe ubite kutibandzakanya kweNyakatfo Koriya ngekutsi """"sinyatselo lesikhulu..."""" which translates to ""Bush's spokesperson, Gordon Johndroe called North Korea's engagement a """"big step...""""

"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lokungenteka iyimbangela yekuvuta lokuchubekako kwemaventi elithange?","Based on the passage, the likely cause of the ongoing venting from the tank is **C: Kwandza kwekushisa (Increased heat)**.

The passage states, ""Kusukela ngaLesitsatfu ntsambama, emathange bekaloku avuta lokungenteka kwakubangelwa kushisa lokwakungekhatsi kwelithangi."" This directly links the venting to internal heat.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Indzawo yesibili yekugcina igcwaliswe yaze yefika emtsameni:** The passage states that the secondary containment area was NOT full.
*   **B: Kuhlola lokwetayelekile kweluhlelo lwekulawula umlilo:** The fire safety test caused the power outage, but it is not directly linked to the venting.
*   **D: Ngumlilo kulenye yemaphampu aseFort Greely:** The passage doesn't mention a fire at one of the Fort Greely's pumps."
Kungani emavaluvu ekukhulula avulekile?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuphele gesi ngemuva kwekuhlolwa kwemishini**.

Here's why:

Kuvuleka kwemavalvu kuvumela kutsi umoya uphume nekutsi kuphume oyili ungene ethangeni lelingafaka imiphongolo lengu-55,000 (2.3 wetigidzi temagaloni)."" This directly links the power outage due to a fire safety test to the valves opening."
"Njenganyalo, aphakeme kangakanani emanti e-The Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **C: Afika elukhalo**.

The passage states: ""I-Ninth Ward, lebhekene nesikhukhula lesingetulu kwetinyatselo letingu-20 ngesikhatsi kuchubeka Sikhukhula iKatrina, njengamanje inemanti lafika elukhalweni...""
"
"Ngesikhatsi kuneSiphelo Lokutsiwa NguKatrina, kwentekani e-The Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **C: Emanti bekangefidi langu-20 kuphakama**.

The passage states: ""I-Ninth Ward, lebhekene nesikhukhula lesingetulu kwetinyatselo letingu-20 ngesikhatsi kuchubeka Sikhukhula iKatrina...""  ""Tinyatselo"" translates to ""feet"" in English.  Therefore, during Hurricane Katrina, the Ninth Ward experienced flooding of over 20 feet.

Yini bososayensi labafuna kuyitfola?,"The correct answer is **D: Kutsi uMhlaba wakheka kanjani** (How the Earth was formed).

The passage states that scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, ""ikakhulukati kutsi uMhlaba wakheka njani"" which directly translates to ""especially how the Earth was formed"".
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguyiphi indzima leyadlalwa ngemaphoyisa endzawo kulokuvalwa?","The correct answer is **C: Acondzisa bashayeli betimoti kuleminye imigwaco**

The passage states: ""Emaloli ekutfutsa dodi bekuvinjwe ngawo imigwaco kwaze kwasita emaphoyisa langu-80 kutsi akhombise timoto kutsi tihambe ngaletinye tindlela."" This clearly indicates that the police were directing traffic to other routes.
"

The passage states that ""emaloli ekutfutsa dodi bekuvinjwe ngawo imigwaco kwaze kwasita emaphoyisa langu-80 kutsi akhombise timoto kutsi tihambe ngaletinye tindlela"". This indicates that roads were blocked and police were redirecting traffic. This means the tube entrance was being used to redirect traffic.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: Bekasetjentiselwe kuphambukisa**
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengazange yenteke ngembi kwekutsi umtsebuli wetitfombe ashayiswe yimoti?","The correct answer is **D: Lomtsebuli wetitfombe wakhona kutsatsa sitfombe saBieber** (The photographer managed to take a picture of Bieber).

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions the photographer was trying to take pictures of a police officer pulling someone over. It does **not** say they successfully took a picture of Bieber.
*   The passage directly mentions that the photographer was asked by the highway patrol to return across the street.
*   The passage directly mentions that the photographer parked their car on the side of Sepulveda Boulevard.
*   The passage directly mentions the photographer was trying to take pictures of a police officer pulling someone over."
Yini lomtsebuli wetitfombe lebekatama kuyenta ngembi kwekushayiswa yimoti?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: Kwengca umgwaco lophitsitelako** (Crossing a busy road).

This clearly indicates he was attempting to cross the road when he was hit.
"
Ngumaphi emavi langasichazi kahle simo samengameli ngemuva kwekutfolakala neligciwane?,"The correct answer is **D: Unemfiva**.

The passage states that Arias does *not* have a fever: ""Ngaphandle kwekushisa nemphimbo lobuhlungu... "" (Without a fever and sore throat...).  Therefore, having a fever is something that does *not* accurately describe the president's condition. The other options are all directly supported by the text.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako laliciniso mayelana namengameli?","Let's analyze the provided text and the answer options:

*   **Text:** ""Arias utfolwe kutsi unalo kancane leligciwane... Simo semengameli sizinzile... utawuke sekabe yedvwana ativalele ekhaya lakhe emalanga lamanyentana. Ngaphandle kwekushisa nemphimbo lobuhlungu, ngitiva ngikahle futsi ngiphilile futsi ngingakhona kuchubeka nemsebenti wami ngekuchumana nalabanye.""

Now let's evaluate the answer options:

*   **A: Ute imfiva (He does not have a fever):** The text says, ""Ngaphandle kwekushisa..."" which translates to ""Apart from fever..."" indicating he *does* have a fever. So, this is incorrect.
*   **B: Utawuchubeka asekhaya emaviki lambalwa (He will continue to stay home for a few weeks):** The text mentions ""emalanga lamanyentana"" which means ""several days,"" not necessarily weeks. Furthermore, he aims to return to work next Monday. So, this is incorrect.
*   **C: Seweluleme ngalokwenele kutsi angachumana nebantfu ngelucingo (He is well enough to communicate with people by phone):** The text states, ""ngingakhona kuchubeka nemsebenti wami ngekuchumana nalabanye"" which translates to ""I can continue my work by communicating with others"". This implies he can communicate remotely, potentially by phone. So, this is likely correct.
*   **D: Leligciwane limbambe kamatima (The virus has hit him hard):** The text says ""simo semengameli sizinzile"" which translates to ""the president's condition is stable,"" and he reports feeling ""kahle futsi ngiphilile"" which translates to ""good and healthy"". Thus, this is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Seweluleme ngalokwenele kutsi angachumana nebantfu ngelucingo**."
"Ngekwalesicephu, kunini lapho siphepho lokutsiwa ngu-Tropical Cyclone lokulindzeleke kutsi sichubeke sehla khona?","The correct answer is **C: Ngembi kwekufinyelele lizinga laso lesisetulu**.

The passage states that the cyclone reached speeds of 240 km/h at its peak, and *currently* the wind speed is 83 km/h and expected to decrease further. Therefore, the cyclone is expected to decrease *before* reaching its peak speed.
"
Besingakanani sivinini semoya ngesikhatsi siphepho lokutsiwa ngu-Tropical Cyclone Gonu sinemandla kakhulu khona?,"The correct answer is **A: Emakhilomitha langu-240 ngeli-awa**.

The passage states that Cyclone Gonu reached speeds of 240 kilometers per hour when it was strongest.
"
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungasiso sici se-Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **A: Ingulolunye luhlobo lwetihlahla tasemantini**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Karenia brevis is a ""marine organism."" Tihlahla tasemantini means ""Marine plants,"" which implies it's a plant. Marine organisms can be many things, and the other answers match what the passage says about Karenia brevis (nerve damage, naturally occurring blooms)."
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako iKarena brevis lengakhoni kukwenta?,"Based on the provided passage, the correct answer is:

**B: Kwandza kakhulu ngaphansi kwanome ngutiphi timo**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that *Karenia brevis* (the organism causing red tide) expands significantly when **specific environmental conditions** come together and create a favorable habitat. The passage emphasizes that certain natural characteristics can bring about these conditions. This implies that *Karenia brevis* needs the right circumstances to multiply rapidly, not just any condition.
*   The passage explicitly states the other options as potential effects of Karenia Brevis:
    *   A: The toxin harms the nervous system of both humans and marine life.
    *   C: Causes Red tide in the water, therefore changes the waters color.
    *   D: The passage states that it produces a neurotoxin that can harm the nervous system in humans and marine life."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungazange kwenteke ngenca ye-Siphepho Lokutsiwa Ngu-Felicia?","The correct answer is **D: Kugcwala kwemanti emgwacweni**.

The passage states that no damage or flooding has been reported. The other options are mentioned as having occurred: ""beneficial"" rain, rain accompanied by thunder, and lightning. Therefore, flooding is the only option that the passage indicates did *not* happen.
"

"
Yini leyabangela kutsi iRussia ivale kusetjentiswa kwe-II-76s?,"The correct answer is **B: Ingoti** (Accident).

The passage states: ""IRussia yamisa ema-Il-76s kwesikhashana emvakwalesehlakalo."" (""Russia temporarily grounded Il-76s after the incident."") and that the incident was when ""injini yaphuma nakusukwa"" (""an engine failed during takeoff""). This clearly connects the grounding to the accident.
"
Iyini i-II-76?,"The correct answer is **C: Indizamshini** (Airplane).

The passage mentions ""i-Il-76 beyisolo ilithuluzi lelikhulu lemabutfo omabili eRussia neSoviet"" which translates to ""The Il-76 has been a major tool for both the Russian and Soviet armies."" This strongly suggests it is an aircraft. The fact that an engine came off during takeoff also indicates it's an airplane.

The passage states: ""...tikhutsato latfunyelelwa tona ngulabanye besifazane nebesilisa..."" which translates to ""...encouragements she received from other women and men...""
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini labanye bantfu lebebangafuni bantfu labasikati bakhulume ngayo?","The correct answer is **C: Imphilo yalabasikati**.

The passage states that Fluke wrote that efforts to get women to talk about their health had been successful. This implies that some people *didn't* want women to talk about their health.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguyiphi intfo emkhatsini lehamba kakhulu?","Let's analyze the passage.

The passage describes something being like water and seeing through it, like seeing pebbles at the bottom of the ocean. Stofan then states that Earth is the only place known to show greatness beyond Titan.

The question asks what thing among the choices is implied to be the most vast. The passage doesn't directly say *anything* travels, but rather talks about relative sizes. Earth is described as being greater than Titan.

Therefore, the answer is A: Umhlaba (Earth).
"
Imifula nemachibi lanalokungemanti itfolakele kuphi?,"The correct answer is **B: I-titan**.

The passage describes something that looks like water and is transparent like water. It then mentions Titan as a place on the planet."
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokutfolakele lokungasiwo umphumela walokunye lokuye kwatfolakala ngetinsiba?,"The correct answer is **D: Sicinisekiso sekutsi ema-dinosaur anetinsiba**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the fossil *not only confirms* the widely held belief that dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details about the feathers. This implies that the existence of feathered dinosaurs was already an established idea. The rest of the findings (color, feather evolution, function) are new insights *based on* this specific fossil."
Yini tinsiba te-dinosaur betite kona?,"The correct answer is **C: Timphiko letindzala**.

The passage states: ""Ngenca yokutsi timphiko temadayinasosi atinayolendzawo lecijile lekhule ngalokwanele, lebitwa ngekutsi i-rachis..."" This indicates that the dinosaur wings lacked a well-developed rachis, which is a key component of modern bird wings. The question uses ""timphiko letindzala"" (old wings) to refer to this rachis. The passage goes on to state that the presence of other feather structures indicates that the rachis evolved later.
"

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi emavi langasilo liciniso mayelana nema-lobate scarps?","The correct answer is **B: Kuba khona kwawo kusho kutsi inyanga inaso sandla kulokwenteka emhlabeni**.

The passage states that the discovery of these scarps and their recent formation *contradicts* the idea that the moon doesn't influence Earth's activities. Therefore, it is not true that the existence of lobate scarps implies that the moon influences Earth.  The other options are all supported by the passage.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumuphi umbono mayelana nekuma kwemhlaba loveta kutsi kukhona lokwentekako enyangeni lokutsintsa umhlaba?","The correct answer is **D: Lokwenteka kwetintfo emhlabeni kusandza kwenteka**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""lobate scarps"" (evidence of the moon shrinking) appear to be small and recently formed. This implies that the shrinking process is ongoing or recent. The passage contrasts this recent lunar activity with the idea that the moon doesn't interact with Earth's processes.  Therefore, recent geological activity on the moon challenges the view that the moon has no interaction with processes happening on earth.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengeke ibe ngetulu kwaloku kuze kubekwe licala?","The correct answer is **A: Emavi lengetiwe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""ICrown Office, lekungiyo lebukelele kushushisa, itjele betindzaba kutsi kute lesatokusho kute kube ngulapho ibekwa licala ngalokusemtsetfweni."" - This means the Crown Office will not say anything until a formal indictment occurs. The passage does not specifically say anything about publishing pictures, talking about eyewitness evidence, or publishing headlines being required prior to an indictment."
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengasiyo inkinga lekhona nyalo kubantfu labatingela emasili?","The correct answer is **D: Kuncibilika kwelichwa**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states that:
*   Bad weather is hindering rescue efforts.
*   The size and density of the ice pile are also problems.
*   The collapse of the ice floe is also a challenge

The paragraph doesn't mention the melting of the ice floe as a problem hindering the rescue attempts.
"
"Ngetulu kwelichwa, yini lenye lephazamisa imetamo yekuhlenga?","The correct answer is **B: Simo selitulu**.

The passage states that ""simo selitulu lesibi kakhulu sibambetele imitamo yekusindzisa"", which translates to ""severe weather is hindering rescue efforts"".

"
Ngusiphi sihloko Roberts leva ngatsi asifaneleki kutsi kucocwe ngaso?,"The correct answer is **P: Roberts akakufuni kukhuluma ngemitengo lephatselene nekutsi kuphila kucala kuphi.
A: lapho kuphila kucala khona.

Thus, the option that best reflects this is:

*   The correct answer cannot be found in the multiple choices provided above.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kungashintjashintji kweTijubo Tenkantolo Lephakeme:** Roberts emphasized the importance of legal precedent (stare decisis) in Supreme Court decisions, but he didn't say it was inappropriate to discuss.
*   **B: Sincumo ecaleni la-Roe naWade:** Roberts did talk about Roe v. Wade.
*   **C: Lilungelo lebumfihlo lobunconywako:** Roberts acknowledged the right to privacy connected to Roe.
*   **D: Imininingwane yemacala:** Not addressed in the provided excerpt."
Imisebe yekukhanya lemibili ikhanya kuphi?,"The correct answer is **A: Kubheka esibhakabhakeni**.

The passage states: ""Imisebe lemibili yekukhanya imiswe yabuka etulu, kuze ikhombe esibhakabhakeni ebusuku."" This directly translates to ""Two beams of light were turned upwards, to point at the sky at night.""

"Ngekwalesicephu, titezi titokwakhiwa nini kulendzawo?","The correct answer is **D: Nakusachubeka kwakha**.

The passage states that ""Kwakhiwa kwemabhilidi lamade lamahlanu kuyachubeka endzaweni yesakhiwo..."" which translates to ""Construction of five tall buildings is ongoing in the construction area..."" This indicates that construction is *currently* happening."
Ngukuphi kwatiswa lokuveta kutsi i-The Seven Sisters mihume?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwehlukahluka kwemazinga ekushisa**.

The quote states: ""Tintfombe telizinga lekushisa kwasebusuku nakwasemini tikhombisa kutsi kungenteka kunemehluko. Ayabandza kunetindzawo letiseceleni kwayo ngesikhatsi sasemini bese ayafutfumala ebusuku."" This directly supports the idea that temperature variations are a characteristic of The Seven Sisters caves.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Bukhulu balakungenwa khona kulemihume:** While the quote mentions the size of the entrances, it doesn't directly link that size to the classification of the caves themselves. It's just a description.
*   **C: Kuhlolwa kwemhlaba:** While geological surveys and examination of the soil and rocks around an area can be useful to determine if an area is composed of cave networks, this is never mentioned in the extract provided.
*   **D: Titfombe temihume eMhlabeni:** While it is possible that images of caves on Earth could indicate the existance of The Seven Sister caves, the quote also states that The Seven Sister caves are different from other cave structures on Earth."
Kubonakala kanjani kushisa ku-Seven Sisters?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngetitfombe te-infrared**.

The text states: ""Tintfombe telizinga lekushisa kwasebusuku nakwasemini tikhombisa kutsi kungenteka kunemehluko."" The phrase ""tintfombe telizinga lekushisa"" is a clear indication that the temperature differences were observed using thermal (infrared) imagery.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi emavi langasilo liciniso mayelana nemsolwa?","The correct answer is **D: Bekangakalimali**.

Here's why:

(The man drove a three-wheeled car with guns towards a crowd of people), which confirms he used a vehicle.

*   **B: Kusolwa kutsi wachumisa sichumane (He is suspected of detonating a bomb):** The passage explicitly says ""Lendvodza lesolelwe kuchumisa ibhomu yabanjwa emvakwekulimala kulokuchuma."" (The man suspected of detonating a bomb was arrested after being injured in the explosion).

*   **C: Buve bakhe batiwa tiphatsimandla (His nationality is known to the authorities):** The passage states ""Ligama lakhe solo alatiwa kutiphatsimandla, nobe bati kutsi ulilunga leluhlanga lemaUighur."" (His name is still unknown to the authorities, nor do they know if he is a member of the Uighur nation), therefore it is implied his nationality is not yet confirmed to be Uighur.

*   **D: Bekangakalimali (He was not injured):** The passage clearly mentions ""Lendvodza lesolelwe kuchumisa ibhomu yabanjwa emvakwekulimala kulokuchuma."" (The man suspected of detonating a bomb was arrested after being injured in the explosion). This directly contradicts option D.

Therefore, option D is the statement that is not true according to the passage."

The passage also says ""...simo lesivamile salesikhumulo siphindze sabuyiselwa."", meaning that the station had a problem in returning to the normal attitude.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Kugcina libanga lelifanele kusuka enjinini lencane:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Kusebentisa indiza:** The passage says that the director used the spaceship, but doesn't mean the spaceship was being used to bring back the normal state.
*   **D: Kutfola simo sengcondvo lesetayelekile:** This was a result of the problem, not the problem itself.
"

Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokwatsintfwa unomphela kwakhiwa kwelidamu?,"The correct answer is **D: Kusabalala kwenkhucunkhucu** (The spread of floods).

The passage states directly that the floods, which used to spread across the area, were *mitigated* (tamiswa - moved/controlled) after the dam was built. This means the dam permanently changed the way floods spread. The passage also states that the dam has affected the river's ecosystem.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngubani lowacwayisa i-United States ngekuhlalelwa lokungase kwenteke?","The correct answer is **C: Ngumtfombo longatiwa (An unknown source)**.

The passage states that the U.S. received the information ""kumbiko kubantfu labangakashiwo"" which translates to ""from people who were not named"" or ""from an unknown source"".
"
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako lalichaza kahle lichinga labontsamolukhuni lekuhlasela lokusolwa kutsi likhona?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuchumisa emabhomu emaveni lamabili**

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states the planned bombings are intended to target **Kenya** and **Ethiopia** (Topiya).
*   The text does not mention any targetting of communication infrastructure.
Therefore, B is the only option that aligns with the given information."
Ngumuphi kulabantfu labalandzelako longasiye ummeli?,"The correct answer is **D: NguMakis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

*   **Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos:** The passage states they were found guilty of defrauding people, implying they were in a position to do so, likely in a professional role (related to law, property, or finance). Even if it's not explicitly stated they are lawyers, they are linked to the scandal involving lawyers.

*   **Petros Mantouvalos:** The passage directly states he is a ""lilunga lePhalemende nemmeli"" which translates to ""member of Parliament and lawyer.""

*   **Makis Triantafylopoulos:** The passage identifies him as a ""intsatseli"" (""journalist"") who exposed information on his television program. Therefore, he is not a lawyer."
Nguliphi licembu lebantfu lelingabalwa njengencenye yelihlazo lelikhona kubetemtsetfo baseGreece?,"Based on the provided text, the following groups are implicated in the legal scandal in Greece:

*   **Judges (Emajaji):** The text mentions ""abehluleli"" and specifically names chief judge Evangelos Kalousis.
*   **Lawyers (Bameli):** The text mentions ""abameli"" in general, and specifically names Petros Mantouvalos, a member of Parliament and a lawyer, as being implicated.
*   **Notaries (Bameli bemafa):** The text mentions ""bameli bemafa"" as being involved.

Therefore, the correct answers from the options provided are **B: Emajaji** and **D: Bameli**.

While the text mentions that the investigation was initiated by a journalist (C: Tintsatseli), they are not part of the legal scandal itself.

However, since the question is asking for a single correct answer from the provided options, and both judges and lawyers are explicitly mentioned, **D: Bameli (Lawyers)** is a slightly broader category that encompasses more of the people involved in the scandal. So, if I had to choose just one, I would select **D**.

Therefore, the best answer from the given options is:

**D: Bameli**

*   ""...emukva kwekulahlekelwa ngema-wicket kukaputeni waseNdiya wenta ema-runs langu-36 **walahlekelwa ema-wickets langu-7** ngasekupheleni kwema-innings.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 7**

Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungasiyo imbangela yekukhungatseka kwa-Adam Cuerden?,"The correct answer is **A: Umgomo lomusha wesayithi lomayelana netintfo letitsintsa tasecansini**.

Here's why:

*   **P** clearly states that Adam Cuerden's frustration stems from:
    *   Wales lying about the legal reasons for the art removal.
    *   Wales pretending to listen to him.
    *   Wales's art being removed.
* The creation of a new policy about sexually explicit materials is mentioned as a *result* of the community's frustration, not a cause of Adam Cuerden's specific frustration."
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini leyasuswa kulesayithi?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Tintfo letimayelana nekuya ecansini**.

The passage mentions ""emitamweni leyentiwako nyalo yekubhala umtsetfo mayelana netitfo letiphatselene netemacansi"" which translates to ""efforts being made now to write a law regarding content related to sexuality"". This indicates that content of a sexual nature is the subject of concern and potential removal.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako Amir Khan langakusekeli?","The correct answer is **A: Kufaka labasikati labalwako kuma-Olimpiki (Including women fighters in the Olympics)**

The passage states that Amir Khan, despite supporting the British contestants for the 2012 Olympics, believes ""bantfu besimame akukafaneli balwe (women shouldn't fight)."" This directly implies he does not support women fighting, which aligns with option A.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokutawusekelwa ngu-Amir Khan ngisho nangetulu kwemibono yakhe?","The correct answer is **C: Ema-Olimpiki a-2012**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that even though Amir Khan has personal views against women boxing, he will support the British contestants in the 2012 London Olympics. This directly implies his support for the *Olympics* themselves, since he's supporting the athletes participating in them."
Peter Lenz wafa nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Esibhedlela** (In the hospital).

The passage states he died in the hospital after being taken there.

Kukusiphi simo lapho umgibeli wendiza lowesabako kungenteka khona kutsi azuze ngekucondza indlela indiza lesebenta ngayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Nangabe kwesaba kwakhe kundiza kubangelwa kwesaba lokungatiwa**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kulabanye bantfu, kucondza lokutsite ngendlela tindiza letisebenta ngayo nekutsi kwentekani nawusendizeni kungabasita bancobe kwesaba lokusekelwe etintfweni labangatati noma nasekwehlulekeni kucondzisa tintfo.""

This directly implies that understanding how planes work can help people overcome fear stemming from *not knowing* or not understanding. This aligns perfectly with option B.

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nangabe lomgibeli anemahloni ngekwesaba kwakhe:** While the passage acknowledges fear of flying is common, being ashamed of the fear itself isn't directly addressed as something that can be solved by understanding how planes work.
*   **C: Nangabe umgibeli angahambisani nato tonkhe tinhlobo tetekutfutsa:** The passage focuses specifically on the fear of flying, not a general dislike of all transportation.
*   **D: Nangabe kwesaba kwakhe kuyimbangela yetintfo letibuhlungu letingahlobene nekundiza:** If the fear is rooted in unrelated traumatic experiences, understanding plane mechanics is unlikely to help. The passage suggests knowledge helps with fears rooted in lack of knowledge, not trauma."
"Ngalokusekelwe kulesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako umuntfu lohambako lokhatsateka kakhulu ngemali lokufanele ayente ekugcineni?","The correct answer is **C: Kucatsanisa imali etinkapanini letehlukahlukene tekuhamba.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that it's uncommon to book directly without comparing prices first.
*   It highlights that the same flight can have significantly different prices.
*   Therefore, comparing prices across different sources is emphasized as a cost-saving measure.

While checking airline websites (D) is mentioned, the passage emphasizes comparing prices *before* that, implying a broader comparison of travel companies (C) is the primary step. Options A and B are generally not recommended based on the content in the paragraph.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini bantfu labahambako lokufanele bayente kucala kuze batfole emanani lancono etindiza nakungenteka?","The best answer is **B: Kucatsanisa emanani kumakhasi e-inthanethi lehlukene.**

The passage explicitly states that comparing prices across different sources (presumably including airline websites and travel agencies) is helpful because the same flight can have different prices.  Options A, C, and D go against this advice.
"
Kunini lapho kudzingeka khona kutsi umngani ahambe nentfo lemikiswako?,"The correct answer is **C: Nangabe tintfo titfunyelwa njengemitfwalo lehloliwe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states, ""Imitsetfo yetindiza angeke ibavumele kutsi batfumele liputumende angekho umnikati walo, kulapho-ke wena lawungena khona.""
*   This means the need for someone to accompany the package arises specifically when it's being shipped as checked baggage."

It mentions that even if you usually fly with one airline, the benefits and destinations can vary between airlines *within* the same alliance.

Therefore, the company that would most likely give you more frequent flyer points would be **B: Inkapani loyisebentisa kakhulu ngephansi kwemfelandzawonye lofanako**
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumuphi kulemiva lelandzelako longase ukhinyabetwe kunatsa kakhulu tjwala?","The correct answer is **B: Kubona**.

The passage states that long-term heavy alcohol consumption can lead to ""ukungaboni emehlweni"" which translates to ""blindness"".
"
"Njengobe kushiwo kulesicephu, yini lokungenteka inciphise bungoti tjwala lobunato?","The correct answer is **C: Kunatsa tjwala ngalokusesilinganisweni (Drinking alcohol in moderation)**.

The passage emphasizes the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption and illegally produced alcohol.  Drinking in moderation is the only option presented that would reduce the risks associated with alcohol consumption.
"
Kukuphi lapho emanani etindzawo aphakeme kakhulu khona e-Amsterdam?,"The correct answer is **A: Sifundza SaseCanal**.

The passage states that the Canal District is famous and unique culturally and historically. It implies its prominence and significance. While other options might be related to valuable locations, the passage directly links the Canal District to its prominence.
"
Kungani Sifundza SeCanal sikhetfwe ktusi sibe Yindzawo Yemagugu Emhlaba Ye-UNESCO?,"The correct answer is **A: Kubaluleka kwayo emlandvweni nakutemasiko** and **B: Tindzawo tayo letehlukile**.

The paragraph states the Canal District was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site ""ngenca yekwehluka kwaso ngekwemasiko nangekwemlandvo, netindzawo taso tinguleto letihamba phamphili kulelive"" which translates to ""because of its cultural and historical uniqueness, and its landmarks are the most outstanding in the country."" Therefore, both A and B are correct.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokwenta kuvakashela i-Phnom Krom kube ngulokuzuzisako?","The correct answer is **A: Kubona i-Tonle Sap** and **D: Kuhamba ngesikebhe echibini.**

Here's why:

*   **A: Kubona i-Tonle Sap:** The passage explicitly mentions ""Lesimo lesidzabukisako salelithempeli nalokubukela lesichibi iTonle Sap kwenta lokucanca lelidvwala kube ngulokudzingekile."" (The stunning scenery of the temple and overlooking Tonle Sap lake makes the rock carving a must.)
*   **D: Kuhamba ngesikebhe echibini:** The passage states ""Kuba mnandzi kutsi nawuvakashela khona uphindze ugibele sikebhe lesiya esichingini."" (It's fun to visit there and also take a boat trip to the village).

*   **B: Kuhamba e-Angkor Pass:** While the passage mentions needing an Angkor Pass, it states that it is to enter the temple and not necessarily to travel the Angkor Pass itself. It says ""I-Angkor Pass iyadzingeka kungena kulelithempeli ngako ungakhohlwa kuta nepasipoti yakho uma uta eTonle Sap."" (An Angkor Pass is required to enter the temple so don't forget to bring your passport when you come to Tonle Sap.)

*   **C: Kubona i-Siem Reap:** The passage mentions that Phnon Krom is located 12 kilometers southwest of Siem Reap, not necessarily that one has to visit Siem Reap to make visiting Phnom Krom worthwhile.

Therefore, both **A** and **D** are correct, because the passage highlights the scenic views of Tonle Sap and the boat trip as reasons to visit Phnon Krom."
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini ledzingekako kulabavakashile kuze bangene e-Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Kutfola i-Angkor Pass**

The passage states: ""I-Angkor Pass iyadzingeka kungena kulelithempeli ngako ungakhohlwa kuta nepasipoti yakho uma uta eTonle Sap."" (The Angkor Pass is required to enter this temple so don't forget to bring your passport if you are coming to Tonle Sap.)
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungavimbela sivakashi kutsi sivakashele i-Antarctica?","The correct answer is **A: Imali lenyenti yeluhambo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""Kuvasha kwetivakashi takulamanye emave kuyadula"" (International tourist visits are expensive). This directly implies that high travel costs could prevent someone from visiting.
*   The other options are either advantages or don't really prevent a tourist from traveling to the area."
Sivakashi lesinenshisekelo yekucanca intsaba singase sivakashele yini incenye ye-Antartica?,"The passage states: ""Batsandzi bekuhamba emoyeni ngasikhatsi baya emkhatsini nelive, kucanca tintsaba nobe kufika kuPole..."". This indicates that mountain climbing happens in the interior.

Therefore, the answer is **B: Indzawo Lesekhatsi** (The Interior).
"
Kukuphi lapho amancane khona ematfuba ekutsi indzawo yekuhlola yangembi kwesikhatsi sesimanjemanje ibe khona?,"The passage states that old observatories are typically found in cities or educational institutions because pollution wasn't a big concern back then and they were easier to access. Modern observatories, on the other hand, are in remote, pristine locations. Therefore, the least likely place for a pre-modern observatory would be a remote area.

So the answer is: **C: Endzaweni lechelile** (In a remote area)
"
Kukuphi lapho sibonakudze sesimanjemanje sekwenta luhlolo lokunematfuba lamanyenti ekutsi sibekwe khona?,"The passage states: ""Tibonakudze tesimanjemanje tekucwaninga tinkhulu futsi telizinga leliphakeme futsi tingasetjentiswa **etindzaweni letikhashane letinesimo lesihle.**""

Based on this, none of the options provided perfectly reflect this. However, the closest and most encompassing answer would be:

*   **D: Esakhiweni lesikhulu**

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Emsamo:** While old labs might become museums, the passage focuses on the *location* where modern telescopes are *used*.
*   **B: Etakhiweni tenyuvesi:** While universities might house telescopes, the passage emphasizes remote locations with good conditions, not necessarily university buildings.
*   **C: Endzaweni yetemfundvo:** Again, the key is the *location* being remote and suitable for optimal conditions.

While ""large facility"" isn't as specific as ""remote locations with good conditions,"" it's the closest match among the provided choices because modern telescopes are *large* and require *facilities* to house and operate them.

"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kukuphi lapho timo tingaba nguletiphephe khona kutsi ungabhukusha?","The correct answer is **C: E-Central Auckland**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the beaches along Tamaki Drive in Central Auckland (Mission Bay and St Heliers) are safe for swimming.
*   Although the passage states that almost all the beaches in the North Shore area are safe to swim in, the question is asking for where the conditions *specifically* stated to be safe to swim. Since the passage explicitly mentions the beaches along Tamaki Drive in Central Auckland as being safe to swim, this makes option C the correct answer.
*   While Long Bay and Devonport are mentioned as the boundaries of beaches in North Shore, it doesn't explicitly say swimming is safe at those specific locations.
*   North Harbour District is too general; the passage mentions that *almost all* beaches there are safe, but it's not as direct as the statement about Central Auckland."
"Nawusavakashele indzawo lechazwe kulesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungatsatfwa njengalokungakafaneli?","The correct answer is **B, C, and D**. Here's why:

*   **B: Kushiya lokudvwetjiwe endzaweni letsile (Leaving graffiti):** The prompt specifically asks you not to deface the location with graffiti.

*   **C: Kuhlekisa (Making jokes):** The prompt asks that you refrain from making jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis. Making jokes in general shows disrespect in a solemn location.

*   **D: Kuhhudla sakhiwo (Vandalizing a structure):** This is a form of damage and disrespect, and it goes against the request to treat the location with respect.

*   **A: Kutiphatsa njengalohlonipheke kakhulu (Behaving respectfully):** The prompt explicitly states that you should respect the location, so behaving respectfully is appropriate."
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokuchaza tilwimi te-lingua francas?,"Based on the provided definition, the correct answer is **D: Lokuphilako** (Living).

Here's why:

The passage describes a *lingua franca* as a language used for communication between people who don't share a native language. This means it's a real, *living* language that has evolved to fulfill this specific purpose.  The other options don't fit the description:

*   **A: Mbumbulu** (Artificial): While some lingua francas might incorporate elements of artificial languages, the core concept is that they are naturally occurring and used.
*   **B: Longesiyo imvelo** (Not natural): This could be somewhat true, but it's more accurate to say that the *use* of the language as a lingua franca is driven by a specific need and widespread usage. The language itself might be natural.
*   **C: Lokwakhiwe** (Constructed): This is usually what it is, a constructed way of speaking.

Therefore, **D** is the best answer.
"
Ngumaphi emavi langatichazi kahle tilwimi letingasito letiyinhloko?,"The best answer is **D: Tilwimi letakhiwe letisetjentiswa kakhulu bantfu labakhuluma tilwimi letehlukene.**

Here's why:

*   **P** describes constructed languages (tilwimi letakhiwe) designed for communication where a common language may be lacking. It also mentions their use as a bridge between speakers of different languages.
*   Option **D** directly captures this essence: constructed languages used by people who speak different languages.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Tilwimi letisetjentiselwa kuchumanisa bantfu lokungenteka abevani nabakhuluma:** This is too broad. Many things facilitate communication between people who don't share a language (translators, gestures, etc.).
*   **B: Tilwimi kokubili temvelo naletakhiwe:** The original paragraph mainly describes constructed languages.
*   **C: Tilwimi letakhiwe kuze ticatulule tinkinga tekuchumana:** While true, this doesn't highlight the key aspect of bridging communication gaps *between speakers of different languages*.

Therefore, **D** is the most accurate and specific answer based on the information provided in **P**."
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini umuntfu lokufanele ayihlole nangabe atohamba ngemkhumbi ebusika?","The correct answer is **A: Indzawo ligumbi lelikuyo**.

The passage states: ""Nangabe uwela leNyakatfo Baltic ebusika, hlola indzawo yalendlwana..."" which translates to ""If crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the cabin location...""
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nangabe umkhumbi umuntfu lawugibele usehlobo, yini langase ayigweme?","Based on the passage, if someone takes a cruise in the winter, they should check the harbor area for ice because traveling through ice can be a very jarring experience for those most affected. The passage also mentions that cruises to Saint Petersburg involve spending time in the city and that passengers on cruises do not need visas (check the terms).

The question asks what a passenger on a summer cruise might avoid. Of the options, only *traveling through ice* is something specifically related to the winter season as it says you have to look for ice in the harbor during the winter.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Kuhambe echweni**.
"
Kungani siCatalan sikhatsi lesinyenti sisetjentiswa etimphawini nasetimemetelweni eBarcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: Lulwimi lwekucala lolusemtsetfweni kulelidolobha**.

"
Nguluphi kuletilwimi letilandzelako lolusetjentiswa kakhulu eTitimeleni eBarcelona nakukhishwa timemetelo letentiwa njalo?,"The correct answer is **B: SiCatalan**.

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokunematfuba lamanyenti ekutsi indzawo yekulala leniketa nekudla kwasekuseni futsi lesezingeni lelisetulu ikubeke embili?","Based on the passage, the most likely answer is **A: Tintfo temenyu letikhetsekile**. Here's why:

*   **Emphasis on Breakfast:** The passage explicitly mentions that high-end B&Bs offer ""sidlo lesitsandvwako kuleso sigodzi sangaleso sikhatsi semnyaka noma sidlo selikhetselo lesitsandvwa nguloyo lonimemile."" (a regional favorite or a personally curated breakfast). This highlights the importance of a special and unique breakfast experience.

*   **Other Options:**
    *   While B, C, and D are nice amenities that could add to the experience, they are not explicitly mentioned as high priorities like the special breakfast options. The passage mentions antique furniture, well-maintained grounds, and a swimming pool as nice touches, but not necessarily essential for a top-tier experience. High-speed wifi is not mentioned at all.

Therefore, the passage emphasizes the breakfast experience (""sidlo selikhetselo lesitsandvwako nguloyo lonimemile"" - a personally curated breakfast) more than any other listed amenity."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungasilo lelinye lemaphuzu layinhloko ekucudzelaneni kwema-B&B akanokusho?","The correct answer is **A: Kuhlobisa kwesimanjemanje** (Modern decor).

Here's why:

*   The passage focuses on luxurious B&Bs competing on:
    *   High-end bedding (hand-stitched quilts, antique beds) - relates to **C: Tintfo tekulala letisezingeni lelisetulu** (High-end bedding)
    *   Breakfast featuring local or custom dishes - relates to **B: Tinhlobonhlobo tekudla kwasekuseni lokuniketwa ngetikhatsi letitsite** (Variety of breakfasts offered) and **D: Kudla netinatfo lokutfolakele endzaweni** (Local food and ingredients).
    *   The overall ambiance of historic buildings and manicured grounds.

*   The passage does not mention modern decor as a specific point of competition or emphasis for luxury B&Bs. It highlights historical elements and personalized experiences more."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungeke kubanjelwe eBeijing nga-2022?","The correct answer is **B: Imicimbi yekunjuza echweni yaseTaizicheng**.

The passage states that ""Leminye imicimbi yekuntjuza echweni itoba seTaizicheng,"" meaning some of the skiing events will be held in Taizicheng.  The other options are explicitly stated to be held in Beijing.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuluku lokulandzelako lokutawubanjelwa eBeijing nga-2022?","The correct answer is **C: Ema-Olimpiki asebusika**.

The passage explicitly states ""Lidolobha laseBeijing eShayina litobamba Imidlalo yaseBusika yema-Olimpiki nga-2022..."" (The city of Beijing in China will host the Winter Olympic Games in 2022...)
"
Ngubani losengotini yekutfola i-avian influenza?,"The correct answer is **C: Bantfu labasebenta ngetinkhunkhu** and **A: Bantfu lababuka tinyoni**.

The passage explicitly states ""Kaningi kufakwe bantfu labasebenta ngetinkhunkhu, kodvwa futsi kunengoti kulabo lababuka tinyoni."" This means both poultry workers and bird watchers are at risk.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako lawuchaza kahle umkhuhlane wetinkhukhu?","The correct answer is **C: Bantfu lababuka tinyoni basengotini yekuwutfola**.

The passage states: ""Kaningi kufakwe bantfu labasebenta ngetinkhunkhu, kodvwa futsi kunengoti kulabo lababuka tinyoni."" This directly indicates that bird watchers are at risk of contracting avian flu.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tisebenti tetinkhukhu kuphela letiwutfolile:** The passage states poultry workers are *often* infected, but *also* mentions a risk for bird watchers, so this is false.
*   **B: Banyenti bantfu lokubikwe kutsi banawo kwendlula tinyoni:** The passage mentions fewer than 1000 human cases. It does not discuss how many birds have it, so this statement cannot be confirmed from the passage.
*   **D: Bonkhe bantfu lokubikwe kutsi banawo bafile:** The passage says *some* cases have led to death, not all."

"Ngekwalesicephu, kunini lapho khona i-ID ingase ihlolwe kuletinye tetitimela leteca imincele?","The correct answer is **D: Nasisahamba sitimela**.

The passage states: ""Etitimeleni letiya kulamanye emave luhlolo lwentiwa ekhatsi kulesitimela lesihambako futsi kufanele ube ne-ID lesemtsetfweni nawugibela leto titimela."" This translates to: ""On trains going to other countries, the inspection is done inside the moving train and you must have a valid ID when you board those trains.""

*   **P:** Singapore is a safe place to travel. It is easy to get around and you can buy anything once you get there. It is often warm with strong sunlight.
*   **A: Kubanjwa inkunzi (Being mugged):** Imphendvulo P itsi Singapore iphephile.
*   **B: Kungakhoni kufinyelela etitolo (Not being able to access shops):** Lokoku akucatjisisi, ngoba imphendvulo P itsi ungatsenga yonkhe intfo nakufikile kulendzawo.
*   **C: Kuhlushwa kukhatsala (Suffering from heat exhaustion):** Imphendvulo P ikhuluma ngekushisa nekukhanya kwelilanga. Lokuku kungenta ube nekhatsala.
*   **D: Kulahleka (Getting lost):** Imphendvulo P itsi kulula kuya ngakha kulendzawo.

Ngakoke, nakusetjentjiswa imininingwane lekhona, imodeli ihlatiya kutsi Imphendvulo C inelitsemba lelikhulu lekutsi kwenteke kunaletinye tinketho."
Ngubani longase afuna kungadli emakhekhe aseJalimane?,"The correct answer is **A: Umuntfu loguliswa kakhulu ngemantongomane**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that many baked goods in Germany contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other types of nuts. Someone with a severe nut allergy would need to avoid these.
*   The other options are less likely: someone who dislikes desserts or chocolate may not prefer them, however someone with a nut allergy can be seriously impacted."
Ngusiphi sitsako lesitsatfwa njengencenye yemakhekhe aseJalimane yangesikhatsi lesitsite?,"The correct answer is **A: Emahhabhula (Apples)**.

The passage states that apple cakes are made year-round (""entiwa umnyaka wonke""), implying they are a constant part of German baking. The other fruits are mentioned as being seasonal (summer only). Hazelnuts and almonds are mentioned as common ingredients, but not specifically tied to a particular season.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungeke kunconywe nawuhamba ngemali lencane?","The correct answer is **C: Cela imali kubantfu**.

The passage explicitly states that budget travelers should *not* beg or steal from others. Asking for money from people falls under the category of begging. The other options are either explicitly mentioned as ways to travel cheaply (reducing costs) or implied as necessary (being willing to compromise on comfort).
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngubani longaba nesikhatsi lesimatima nakahamba ngemali lencane kakhulu?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Umuntfu lote sikhatsi lesicinile** (A person without flexible time).

The passage states that those who want to travel cheaply, with little to no cost, need to have time to spare to make up for the lack of money. Therefore, someone *without* flexible time would find it difficult to travel very cheaply.
"
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langakuchazi kahle kushayela emkhatsini we-Point Marion ne-Fairmont?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuyetfukela kutsi litubane lelibekiwe ligcinwe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the suggested speed is clearly marked (35-40 mph) and that sticking to it is important. Therefore, it's **not** rare to maintain the suggested speed. The passage implies that you *should* keep to the speed limit.

The other options are all supported by the text:

*   **A: Kunetincenye letindze temigwaco yasemaphandleni**: This is true because the passage talks about open, wooded areas.
*   **B: Imizila mincane**: This is true because the passage mentions narrow lanes.
*   **D: Isevisi yamahlalekhikhini ayisiyo inkinga**: The passage states that cell service is surprisingly good in this area.

"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokufanele kukhatsate kakhulu bashayeli labashayela emgwacweni i-Buffalo-Pittsburg?","Based on the passage, the biggest concern for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, specifically between Point Marion and Fairmont, should be **C: Kujika ngekushesha**.

The passage explicitly mentions ""ekwehleleni nasemenyukeleni, imivila lemincane, nasemakoneni lavelele"" (hills and valleys, narrow curves, and blind corners). This clearly indicates that sharp turns are a significant characteristic and potential hazard of that section of the road.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungadzingeki kuze ucale kugcuma emfuleni losendzaweni leneliwa?,"Based on the definition provided in passage P, all the options listed are requirements for canyoning *except* the ability to canyon. Canyoning *is* the activity, so you can't require the ability to do it in order to *start* doing it.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Likhono lekugcuma (Likhono lekugcuma).**
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungase kudzingeke nawusagcuma emfuleni losendzaweni leneliwa?,"The best answer is **D: Likhono lekubhukusha** (The ability to swim).

Here's why:

*   **River trekking** involves navigating rivers, often requiring swimming skills.
*   The other options are not necessarily essential:

    *   **A: Likhono lelisetulu lekudlala** (Superior athletic ability) while helpful for any physical activity, is not strictly required for river trekking if you have a basic level of fitness.
    *   **B: Sipiliyoni sekunjweza ekhatsi emantini** (Experience submerging in water) - While helpful, basic swimming skills can get you through many river trekking situations.
    *   **C: Sitifiketi sekugcuma emfuleni losendzaweni leneliwa** (River trekking certification) is not usually required, depending on the specific river and the trekking activity."
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengasita umuntfu lohlela kuyokhempa emotweni?","The best answer based on the passage is **B: Imoti levumela tihlalo kutsi tilale.**

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions that ""kukhempa ngemoto kungenteka nawunekhumbi lencane nobe i-SUV, Sedan nobe Station Wagon lenetitulo letikhonako kulala phansi."" This highlights the importance of having seats that can lie flat for sleeping comfortably.
*   Option A is true but too general, it doesn't give a specific recommendation.
*   Option C is incorrect because the passage compares car camping to tent camping.
*   Option D is incorrect as the passage compares car camping to tent camping which could attract unwanted attention."
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini bantfu labakhempa etimotweni labangase bafune kuyigwema nabafuna kunganakeki?","The correct answer is **C: Kugcumeka lithende edolobheni nome endzaweni lengasiyo yawonkhewonkhe.**

The passage states that putting up a tent in a random place might attract unwanted attention, which is something people camping in their cars might want to avoid. The other options are either benefits of car camping or not related to avoiding attention.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngubani lowakha i-Casablanca kabusha lihlandla lesibili?","The correct answer is **D: Inkhosi yaseMorocco**.

The passage states that the Portuguese rebuilt Casablanca and named it Casa Branca, but then abandoned it after an earthquake. Then, ""Lombusi waseMorocco walakha kabusha lelidolobhakati walicamba ngekutsi yiDaru l-Badya..."" (The Moroccan Emperor rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Badya...).
"
Bobani labashiya lidolobha lesimanje lase-Casablanca ngemuva kwesehlakalo semvelo?,"The correct answer is **B: NgemaPutukezi**.

The passage states that the Portuguese abandoned the city after the earthquake in 1755.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, i-Sintra yakutfola kanjani kucashelwa phakatsi kwebantfu bekuhamba?","The correct answer is **C: Kubuketa lokuhle kwa-Lord Byron**

The passage explicitly states that Sintra became famous among foreigners ""ngenca yembiko lokhatimulako webukhakhati balo lowabhalwa nguLord Byron"" which translates to ""because of the glowing account of its beauty written by Lord Byron"".
"
Yini lengacashelwa yi-Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Umbuso webantfu lomusha**.

The passage states that ""a new republic was formed"" with Armenia's help, but ""no state...recognized it."" This implies that Armenia helped create a new, unrecognized state (a new republic). Therefore, that new republic is what was created, and hence what Armenia is associated with.
"
Yini lechubeka iphazamisa buhlobo emkhatsini we-Azerbaijan ne-Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Sifundza sase-Nagorno-Karabakh**.

The passage explicitly states that the dispute over the Nagorno-Karabakh region continues to damage relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
"
"Nawusahamba ngetekisi e-Charlotte, yini lengaholela ekukhokhisweni lokwengetiwe?","The correct answer is **B: Kuba nebagibeli labatsatfu**.

The passage states ""Ubhala kakhulu nangabe unebantfu lohamba nabo labangetulu kwabangu-2, ngako lendlela lena ingabita kakhulu ngaphandle kwesidzingo."" This means having more than 2 passengers (therefore, 3 or more) will result in a higher fare.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengatsatfwa njengentfo lembi ngekuhlala e-Charlotte nebantfwana?","The correct answer is **B: Kutsatsa itekisi**.

The passage states that taxis in Charlotte are not frequently used by families because they can be expensive, especially with more than two people. This is presented as a disadvantage.
"
"Ngembi kwekufika kwebantfu base-Spain, bobani lebebaphetse incenye lesenyakatfo ye-Chile?","The correct answer is **D: Ema-Incas**.

The passage states that before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, northern Chile was under the rule of the Inca empire.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungazange kwenteke nga-1810?","Let's analyze the passage:

*   **1810:** The passage states that Chile declared independence. It also states that Napoleon's wars were happening, leaving Spain without a functioning government.

The passage does *not* say Chile praised Spain, but instead declared independence from it.

Therefore, the answer is **B: I-Chile yancoma Spain** (Chile praised Spain)."
Bantfu bangafika kanjani etindzaweni letichelile esifundzeni sase-Liguria?,"The passage states: ""Imigcwaco, titimela kanye nemikhumbi lehlanganisa tigodzi, timoto atikhoni kufinyelela kuleto tindzawo.""

This means the correct answer is **C: Ngesitimela nome ngesikebhe** (By train or by boat).
"
Ligama lesiTaliyane lelitsi ‘Cinque Terre’ libhekisela kuphi?,"The correct answer is **A: Tindzawo letisihlanu**.

The first sentence of the passage states that ""Cinque Terre, lokusho kutsi Tindzawo Letinhlanu..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre, which means The Five Lands..."". Therefore, ""Tindzawo letisihlanu"" (The Five Lands) is the meaning of the Italian name ""Cinque Terre"".
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi luhlobo lwesikebhe lolulungela timo letingase tibe nguletishelelako ebusika?","The answer is **D: Emabhudzi lete iphethini lejulile lengema-intji langu-1/5**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that a pattern of 5mm (1/5 inch) or more is needed on the sole of winter footwear to prevent slipping.
*   The passage recommends flat and wide heels.

Therefore, option D aligns with the information provided in the passage."
Ngukuphi kuloku lokungeke kusite ekuvikeleni kushelela emigwacweni lenelichwa ngesikhatsi sasebusika?,"The passage mentions that sand, gravel, and salt (calcium chloride) are used to make roads and sidewalks easier to walk on in icy conditions. Therefore, the answer is **D: Emanti (Water)**. Adding water would make the ice worse, not better.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokuchaza kahle kufana lokukhona emkhatsini we-Hawaii ne-Cook Islands?,"The correct answer is **C: Letindzawo tinesikhatsi lesifanako**.

The passage states, ""Njengoba tihambisana ngetikhatsi neHawaii... "" which translates to ""As they have the same time zone as Hawaii...""

The other options are incorrect based on the passage:

*   **A: Totimbili letindzawo tinemahhotela lamanyenti lamakhulu:** The passage implies Cook Islands *lacks* large tourist hotels, contrasting it with Hawaii.
*   **B: Totimbili letindzawo atisiwo emave:** The passage states the Cook Islands is a self-governing island country in free association with New Zealand
*   **D: Totimbili letindzawo tite emadolobha:** The passage states that the Cook Islands have islands and the main island is Rarotonga. This implies they do have towns.
"
Ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungayichazi kahle i-Cook Islands?,"The correct answer is **C: Emadolobha lamakhulu yi-Rarotonga ne-Aituta**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Lesichingi saseCook site emadolobha kodvwa sinetichingi letingu 15 letehlukene. Lesiyinhloko yiRarotonga kanye ne-Aitutaki."" (The Cook Islands do not have cities, but have 15 different islands. The main ones are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.) This clearly states that the Cook Islands *do not* have cities. Rarotonga and Aitutaki are the *main islands*, not cities.
*   The passage directly supports A, B, and D.
"
Nguyiphi kuletindzawo letilandzelako talabagadza tilwane lenetinhlobo letimbili tetindzawo tekulala longakhetsa kuto?,"The correct answer is **A: I-Sirena**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Sirena ngiyo kuphela indzawo lapho ungakhona kulala khona futsi udle nekudla lokushisako ngetulu nje kwekukhempa."" This implies that Sirena offers both camping and a place to sleep (potentially a lodging of some kind) with hot meals.
*   The passage also states: ""E-La Leona, San Pedrillo utfola kuphela indzawo yekukhempa awukutfoli kudla khona."" This indicates that La Leona and San Pedrillo only offer camping and no food.
*   Los Patos is not mentioned in the provided context, therefore we do not have enough information to determine what it offers."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi lapho ungafuna khona imvume yepaki nawufuna kusebentisa kheshi kunesikweleti?","The correct answer is **B: E-Puerto Jiménez**.

The passage states: ""Kungenteka kutsi utfole imvume yekungena epaki ngalokucondzile eRanger Station ePuerto Jiménez, kodvwa abawemukeli emakhadi ekubhadala ngesikweledi."" This means you can potentially get a permit at the Ranger Station in Puerto Jiménez, and they don't accept credit cards, implying they accept cash.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi luhlobo lwekuntjuza echweni lolwentiwa endzaweni leyehlelako?","The passage describes activities related to visiting snowy areas, and makes an analogy of ""skiing"" to ""hiking up a mountain."" It implies that skiing can cover more distance than hiking.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Kuhamba nge-ski (Skiing)**
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengasita bantfu labantjuza etindzaweni letisemaphandleni labafuna kufinyelela litubane lelisetulu?","The correct answer is **C: Timo letikahle**.

The passage states: ""Esimeni lesikahle utawukwati kuhlanganisa sigaba lesidze kunekuhamba ngetinyawo..."" which translates to ""In an ideal situation you will be able to cover more ground than hiking..."" This indicates that ideal *conditions* will help you cover more ground. While sturdy boots might be necessary, the passage directly highlights ideal conditions (Timo letikahle) as the factor leading to faster travel.
"
Bantfu labebahambile labanenkinga yekwetfuka nababuyela ekhaya yini labakutfola kumatima kuyenta?,"The correct answer is **D: Kwetayelana nelisiko lendzawo yakubo**.

The passage describes ""reverse culture shock"" which is the difficulty of readjusting to one's home culture after living abroad.  The passage explicitly states that people who have lived abroad often find it difficult to readjust to their home culture and have lost some of their old cultural habits.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kwetfuka nawubuyela ekhaya kungabe matima ngalokukhetsekile kuluphi luhlobo lwemuntfu lobekahambile?","The correct answer is **B: Bantfu labahambako labasheshe betayele nabakulamanye emave**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Tivakashi letakhandza kumelula kutivumelanisa nalelisiko lelisha ngasikhatsi tiba nebumatima kuphindze titivumelanisa nelisiko lesive sakito."" This directly connects ease of adaptation abroad to difficulty readjusting at home. The easier it is to adjust to the foreign culture, the harder it is to readjust to their home culture.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Bantfu labahambako labahlangabetane nekwetfuswa lisiko:** While culture shock *is* mentioned in the context of returning, the core argument focuses on the difficulty of *re-adjusting* *after* adapting, not simply having experienced culture shock initially. Everyone going abroad experiences some form of culture shock, but the degree to which one adapts affects their reverse culture shock.
* **C: Bantfu labahambako labaseseholidini letitsandzani:** The passage does not talk about romantic holidays specifically. It addresses returning home after *significant* time living abroad, which changes a person.
* **D: Bantfu labahambako labete sineke:** While impatience could certainly exacerbate the difficulties of reverse culture shock, it's not the central factor highlighted in the text. The passage emphasizes the cultural adaptation itself.

Therefore, option B is the most supported by the text.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokufanele bantfu bangakwenti esilwaneni lokutsiwa yimusi?,"The correct answer is **C: Kutsatsa kancane ingoti yaso (Underestimate its danger).**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** People who don't know moose are dangerous get too close and put themselves in danger. This implies they are underestimating the moose's potential for harm.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kunganaki kutsi ikhona (Ignoring its presence):** While it's true that not being aware of a moose can be dangerous, the passage emphasizes *underestimating* its danger, not just ignoring it.
* **B: Kuya ngelitubane leliphansi kakhulu (Moving at a very slow speed):** The passage does not suggest that movement speed is relevant to moose safety.
* **D: Kuyibukela khashane (Watching it from afar):** Watching from a distance would be the safest course of action, the opposite of what people should *not* do.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langasilo liciniso mayelana nesilwane lokutsiwa yimusi?","The correct answer is **A: Ngekwemvelo tilwane letinelulaka**.

Here's why:

*   **P states:** ""...IMoose (leyatiwa ngele elk) ngekutalwa alinalo lulaka,..."" which directly translates to ""Moose (also known as elk) are by nature not aggressive."" Therefore, option A contradicts the given information.
*   **Option B is True:** ""Bantfu labangati kutsi lesilwane lekutsiwa imooses iyingoti bangasondzela kakhulu kuyo batifake engotini."" This suggests that some people do not consider moose dangerous.
*   **Option C is True:** ""...iyativikela uma ibona kuhlaselwa. Bantfu labangati kutsi lesilwane lekutsiwa imooses iyingoti bangasondzela kakhulu kuyo batifake engotini."" This implies that people getting too close can provoke a defensive reaction.
*   **Option D is True:** ""...iyativikela uma ibona kuhlaselwa."" This confirms that moose do defend themselves when necessary."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kwaloku lokulandzelako lokungeke kube yingoti kakhulu kumuntfu lohamba elugwadvule?","Ngekusekelwe kulesicaphuno, impendvulo lecondzile ngu:

**B: Kubona lutalagu lolwenta kube ngatsiumuntfu ubona emanti**

Lesicaphuno sigcizelela:

*   **Kushisa:** Kungabangela inkinga yemanti (kushoda kwemanti) nekukhatsala, lokuyingoti kakhulu elugwadvule.
*   **Emakhata asebusuku:** Kudzingeka tintfo tekutfutfumela.

Lutalagu luyinkohliso. Ngisho nobe luyakukhungatsa, alukakufaneleki njengenkinga lenkhulu njengekutsi kushode emanti, emandla, nobe timphahla letifutfumele.

Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungashiwongo njengengoti bantfu labahamba elugwadvule labangase babhekane nayo?,"Impendvulo lelungile ngu- **D: Kushiswa lilanga**

Lokunye lokubekiwe kukhuluma ngako kokubili kushoda kwemanti (A), letinye tinkinga letiphatselene nelutalagu (B) kanye nendlela emakhata angaholela ngayo ku-hypothermia (C) nasebusuku. Kodvwa kushiswa lilanga akukabekwa ngalokucondzile njengalengoti lephatsekako.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguliphi licembu lebantfu lelatsintseka kakhulu ngemuva kwekufika kwebahloli bemave?","The correct answer is C: Ema-Taíno

The passage states that the Taino population was decimated by the Spanish conquistadors.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi lulwimi lobelukhulunywa bantfu baseCaribean?","The correct answer is **D: Si-Arawakan**.

The passage states: ""EmaCaribes bekabantfu lebebakhuluma si-Arawaka"".
"
Ngubani lokufanele abongwe ngekwenta umdlalo wekuntjuza echweni watiwe njengemdlalo wekutijabulisa?,"The answer is **B: Bantfu BaseNorway**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that in 1861, the first ski club was opened by Norwegian people in Australia. This club helped in making the sport more known and accessible.
*   The other options are not the primary group credited with popularizing skiing as a recreational sport according to the passage.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kungasiphi sikhatsi lapho kuntjuza echweni kwacashelwa kwekucala njengemdlalo?","The correct answer is **D: Ngelikhulu lesi-17**

The text states: ""Kushibilika elichweni kusukela emuva cishe ngelikhulu lesi-17..."" This indicates that skiing as a sport existed since around the 17th century. While earlier forms of sliding on snow existed, the passage marks the 17th century as the point where skiing emerged.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokuhlotjaniswa ngesichingi lesikhulu kunato tonkhe elugwini lwe-Afrika lesemphumalanga?,"The correct answer is **C: Tilwane tesiganga**.

The passage states: ""IMadagascar ilive lelikhulu futsi ibe sifundzave ngekwaso nakutiwa etilwaneni tesiganga."" This directly links the largest island (Madagascar) to its unique wildlife.
"
Yini lengasiyo imfanelo yetichingi letincane taseMphumalanga Ye-Afrika? ,"The correct answer is **C: Kwatiwa ngetilwane tesiganga (Kwatiwa ngetilwane tesiganga)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Madagascar is known for its unique wildlife (""IMadagascar ilive lelikhulu futsi ibe sifundzave ngekwaso nakutiwa etilwaneni tesiganga.""). It doesn't say this about the smaller islands.
*   The passage mentions that many smaller islands are independent or have relations with France (""Letiningi tichingi letincane ngemave latimele, noma tinebudlelwane neFrance..."").
*   The passage mentions that many islands are known for beaches and resorts (""...tatiwa ngemabhishi lamahle lanetindzawo tekungcebeleka."")"
"Ngekwalesicephu, Liphasika ligunjwa njani, ikakhulukati emasontfo emdzabu?","The passage mentions the following regarding how Easter is celebrated, particularly in traditional churches:

*   Holding vigils on Easter Saturday night
*   Celebrating Christ's resurrection at midnight

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Kubamba umlindzelo ngeMgcibelo (Holding vigils on Saturday)**. The others are mentioned but not as direct liturgical celebrations in the passage.
"
"Kuze ugweme letinye tintfo letifunekako nawungena e-Ecuador, sakhamuti saseCuba kufanele sicale sibe nani?","The correct answer is **D: Matisi waseMelika**.

The passage states: ""Bantfu baseCuba labasebentisa emakhadi aseMelika laluhlata kufanele bavakashele i-Ecuadorian Consulate kute bakhululwe kule mfuneko.""  This means holding a US Green Card (Matisi waseMelika) exempts Cuban citizens from certain requirements.
"
Yini timfuneko tekuvakasha e-Ecuador letingentelwanga yona?,"The correct answer is **A: Kugcina linani letivakashi lilincane.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states the requirements are ""tentelwe kutsi kube nekuhleleka kulabo lahambako emkhatsini walamave lamabili"" - this aligns with option B.
*   The requirement of a return ticket is to provide evidence of the duration of the visit, thus aligning with option C.
*   The passport validity requirement directly addresses passport expiration, thus aligning with option D.

Option A is not mentioned as a reason. While the measures might indirectly affect the number of visitors, the main intention is for organized travel, not to limit the number of travelers."
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungase kubite kakhulu kulelinye live kwendlula eveni lakho?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Emafulemu lasezingeni lelisetulu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""Emafreyimi laphakeme emagama emabrand lakhona kuletindzawo letinjena anetinkinga letimbili; lamanye mhlawumbe angemafreyimi mbumbulu, futsi lalangiwo mbamba langenisiwe mhlawumbe angadula kunewasekhaya."" This indicates that name-brand frames might be *more* expensive in other countries due to import costs.

The other options are less likely:

*   **A: Kuhlolwa kwemehlo:** The passage suggests that eye exams might be *cheaper* abroad (""Tibuko temehlo tingaba nguletishiphile emaveni angephandle"").
*   **C: Umshuwalensi wemehlo:** The passage is about getting exams at home if insurance covers it, it doesn't suggest that eye insurance will be more expensive somewhere else.
*   **D: Emafulemi lete ligama:** The passage is about name-brand frames, and no-name frames are not mentioned."
Nguyiphi ingoti lengase ibe khona ngekutsenga emafulemu lasezingeni lelisetulu kulelinye live?,"The correct answer is **C: Angase abe ngemafulemu mbumbulu**.

The passage specifically states ""...lamanye mhlawumbe angemafreyimu mbumbulu..."" (some might be fake frames). The other options are not directly mentioned as a risk of buying *high-end* frames specifically from other countries. While the passage discusses eye exams and insurance, those are separate points, not inherent risks of buying those particular frames.
"
"Mayelana nekucetjentiswa kwemali e-Falklands, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako laliciniso?","Let's analyze the passage to determine the correct statement:

*   **A: Ngemakhadi etikweleti nampondo waseNgilandi kuphela lokwemukelwako etichingini letingephandle:** This is incorrect. The passage states that credit cards may not be accepted in remote settlements, but British Pounds *may* be accepted.

*   **B: Kuphela kwendzawo lapho kwemukelwa khona lidola laseMelika kuse-Stanley:** This is incorrect. The passage states that US Dollars are accepted in Stanley. However, the passage does not say that is the ONLY place that accepts them. It does state British and American currency MAY be accepted in remote settlements.

*   **C: Mpondo wase-Falkland kufanele ushintjwe ngemuva kwekuphuma etichingini:** This is incorrect. The passage says it's *difficult* to exchange Falkland pounds outside the islands and advises to exchange it *before* leaving.

*   **D: Ngaphandle kwampondo wase-Falkland, mpondo waseNgilandi ngalokuvamile ngiyo imali leyemukelwako:** This aligns with the text, which says that British pounds are accepted anywhere in Stanley and that British currency MAY be accepted in remote settlements. This makes it the most universally accepted currency besides the Falkland pound.

**Therefore, the correct answer is D.**
"
"Ngalokusekelwe kulesicephu, ngawuvakashela i-Falklands usuka eMelika, kukuphi lapho lenye indlela yekubhadala ngaphandle kwelikhadi lesikweleti ingaba lusito khona ngalokukhetsekile?","The correct answer is **C: Etichingini letingaphandle**.

The text states: ""Etichingini letikhashane emakhadi esikweleti angeke avunyelwe, nakuba kungase kusebente intsengo yase-British neyaseMelika...buta kumnikati wesitolo kutsi nguyiphi indlela yokubhadala layamukelako.""

This directly indicates that cash (British Pounds or US Dollars) is particularly useful in more remote settlements (etichingini letingaphandle) where credit cards may not be accepted.
"
Ngumuphi umcimbi longahlotjaniswa nekugunjwa kwemikhosi yelithempeli?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Kutalwa kwendlovu** (Birth of an elephant).

Here's why:

*   The text mentions temple festivals often commemorate the temple's anniversary, the birth of a deity, or other significant events related to the temple. It doesn't mention elephant births as a common reason for temple festivals. While elephants are often present in the festivals, their individual births aren't stated as a reason for celebration."
Kukuphi lapho kungabonakala khona tindlovu letihlotjisiwe?,"The best and most accurate answer based on the provided text is:

**C: Eludvwendvweni lwasemikhosini yasethempelini**

Here's why:

*   **The text specifically states:** ""...nekungena njalo kwetindlovu letihlotjisiwe, i-orchestra yelithempeli naleminye imigidvo"" which directly links decorated elephants to temple festivals.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Nome ngukuphi kusukela ekupheleni kwaNovember kuya emkhatsini waMay** This is a time period and not a location. While the temple festivals happen during this time, it doesn't tell us *where* the elephants can be seen.
*   **B: Emathempelini** While the festivals are held at temples, the text focuses on the *procession* or parade, which is a more specific location within the festival setting. The elephants are part of the procession, not necessarily just standing around in the temple.
*   **D: Etitaladini taseKerala** While the processions *might* go through streets, the text doesn't explicitly state this. The focus is on the temple festival procession. It is more likely that the elephants are part of the procession within the temple grounds, or nearby.

Therefore, C is the most accurate answer directly supported by the text."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungenteka kuyindlela lencono yekonga imali encenyeni yebhizinisi nome yelizinga lekucala endizeni?","Based on the passage, the best answer is **C: Kubhuka indiza yelizinga lekucala lengayi ngalokucondzile endzaweni loya kuyo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that you usually cannot get discounts on business or first-class seats on *direct* flights. This implies that if you are willing to take a flight with layovers (not direct), you might have a better chance of finding a less expensive option.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Kubhadala ngenkapani yakho**- The passage only mention that the cost may be paid by your company but does not imply that it can be a way to save on the cost
*   **B: Kubhuka incenye yelizinga lekucala kunencenye yebhizinisi** - The passage implies that a first-class ticket is more expensive than a business-class ticket
*   **D: Kutfola sephulelo** - The passage says it's generally not possible to find discounts on business or first class on direct flights."
"Ngekwalesicephu, kufuna ini lokungaba kucitsa sikhatsi nawubhuka letinye tigaba tekugibela endizeni?","The correct answer is **C: Tephulelo**.

The passage states ""...asikho sidzingo sekufuna sephulelo ebhizinisini noma tihlalo telizinga lekucala endizeni lesuka ngalokucondzile ku-A iye ku-B."" This clearly indicates that seeking discounts on business or first-class seats for direct flights is a waste of time.
"
Yini lokungadzingeki yengetwe nawusacatsanisa imali yetindiza letiya e-Afrikha nemali yemhlaba wonkhe?,"The correct answer is **B: Tindleko temtselo wekuhamba e-Afrikha**.

Here's why:

The passage instructs you to factor in extra costs *outside* of Africa when comparing travel costs.

*   **A: Tindleko tema-visa etindzawo letingaphandle kwe-Afrikha** (Visa costs outside Africa) - This *should* be added, as it's an extra cost for travel outside of Africa.

*   **C: Tindleko te-visa yase-Afrikha** (Visa costs for Africa) - This is a travel expense that you would have to pay and should be factored in.

*   **D: Tindleko tekwekuhamba emgwacweni etindzaweni letingephandle kwe-Afrikha** (Road transport costs outside Africa) - This *should* be added, as it's an extra cost for travel outside of Africa.

*   **B: Tindleko temtselo wekuhamba e-Afrikha** (Tax for traveling in Africa) - The passage asks what *shouldn't* be added. A tax is not an expense that is only for traveling outside of Africa, so it doesn't need to be added.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini titolo letinkhulu leseticala kuniketa kukhetsa lokuhlukahlukene kuyo?","The correct answer is **A: Kudla lesekuvele kuvutsiwe**.

The passage states: ""Siyenyuka sibalo setitolo letinetinhlobo letingafani tekudla lokuphekiwe."" which translates to ""The number of stores offering a variety of cooked foods is increasing."" This directly indicates that large stores are starting to offer a wider selection of already cooked or prepared foods.
"
Nguluphi lusito loluniketwa titolo letinkhulu lolungase lukhange likhasimende lelitsenga kudla lesekuvele kuvutsiwe?,"The correct answer is **A: Titolo tekudlela**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that a growing number of grocery stores have prepared foods, and some even have a ""place to eat,"" even if it's basic. This ""place to eat"" is essentially a small dining area.
* The passage also mentions that buying food from a grocery store is a relatively cheaper way to eat and that grocery stores offer a chance to eat prepared food.

The other options are incorrect:

*   B: Kukhetsa lokuncane lokuhlukehlukene (Limited selection) - The passage states that there is a growing *variety* of prepared foods available.
*   C: Kudla lokungakavutfwa (Uncooked food) - The question specifically asks about pre-cooked food.
*   D: Hhavini we-microwave (Microwave oven) - While some stores might have microwaves, the more significant amenity that would attract a customer looking for prepared food is a space to eat."
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungenteka kungacondvwa bantfu baseBelgium naseSwitzerland labakhuluma siFulentji?,"The passage states that people in Belgium and Switzerland learn standard French in school and would be able to understand standard French number systems. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

The passage also mentions that the difference between Belgian/Swiss French and French spoken in France isn't significant. This suggests option D (SiFulentji lesinyenti lesikhulunywa eFrance - ""Much French spoken in France"") is less likely to cause misunderstanding. They learn the standard version.

The passage specifically says the number system is different and the pronunciation of *some* words differs slightly. While they learn the standard versions, differences exist. Therefore a specific pronunciation (C) is more likely to cause a slight misunderstanding than something incredibly obscure (B). However, the *most* likely problem given the passage is the differences in number systems.

However, given the structure of the question and the options, the best answer is:

**A: Luhlelo lwetinombolo lolwetayelekile lwesiFulentji**

Here's why: The passage explicitly points to the number system as a key difference. They *learn* the standard number system, implying that while they may understand it, their *default* is different. The question asks what they might *not* understand; if you exclusively used the standard number system, they may struggle to understand you (because they are more used to their version), even if they eventually could. The other options are less certain to cause misunderstanding. Therefore the most likely.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako eFrance lokungafani naseBelgium nome eSwitzerland?,"The correct answer is **B: Luhlelo lwetinombolo**.

The passage explicitly states that the number system in Belgian and Swiss French has distinct features compared to French in France. The other options are either incorrect or not directly supported by the passage:

*   **A: Indlela yekubita onkhe emagama:** The passage says *some* pronunciations differ slightly, not all.
*   **C: SiFulentji letivamile lesifundziswa etikolweni:** The passage states that Belgian and Swiss French speakers *do* learn standard French in school.
*   **D: Indlela lamanye emagama esiFulentji labhalwa ngayo:** The passage does not talk about the writing of the words, only pronunciation and number systems."
Kukusiphi simo lapho ungase unganikwa khona imali yekushonelwa?,"Impendvulo lecondzile ngu **C: Nawuhamba ngeLufthansa usuka eParis uya eMelika**.

"
Ngukuphi lokuliciniso mayelana nemali yekushonelwa?,"The correct answer is **D: Kufanele ubhuke ngalokucondzile nenkapani yetindiza usebentisa lucingo.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Kuto tonkhe tikhatsi, kufanele ubhuke ngamakhalekhukhwini wakho ngalokucondzile esiteshini setindiza"" This translates to ""In all cases, you have to book directly with the airline by phone."""
Kunini lapho kusebentisa i-GPS levamile kungaba lusito kakhulu khona kunekusebentisa i-app ye-GPS?,"The correct answer is **C: Nangabe uphuma ku-inthanethi**.

The passage states that the phone GPS app might not work well or be unavailable if your phone is not connected to the internet. This implies that a regular GPS device (which doesn't rely on the internet) would be more useful when you're offline.
"
Yini lengasiso sizatfu lesihle sekusebentisa i-app ye-GPS nakucatsaniswa nemshini we-GPS lotimele?,"The correct answer is **A: Kungabi nesidzingo sekukhatsateka ngema-datha**.

Here's why:

*   The passage points out the *disadvantage* of using GPS apps: they might not work well if your phone can't connect to the internet or has a weak signal. This is directly related to data usage and connection. A dedicated GPS device doesn't rely on cellular data.

The other options are listed as advantages:

*   **B: Konga imali** (Saving money) - The passage mentions saving money by not buying maps or renting GPS devices.
*   **C: Kubalekela kurenta** (Avoiding rental) - The passage mentions avoiding rental fees from car rental companies.
*   **D: Kungabi nesidzingo sekutsenga emabalave lamasha** (Not needing to buy new maps) - The passage mentions avoiding the cost of buying new GPS maps.

Therefore, needing to worry about data connection is a reason against using a GPS app compared to a dedicated GPS device, making A the correct answer."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ungacinisekisa kanjani kutsi ucondzaniswa nemkhumbi lofanelekako?","The correct answer is **C: Kubhuka nenkapani lesebenta ngekuvakasha eGalapagos**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Ciniseka kutsi inkhapani lotoyisebentisa inelwati lolujulile ngetihlenge nangetinhlobonhlobo temikhumbi. Loku kutocinisekisa kutsi lolokutsandzako kanye/nobe bumantima bakho buyafanana nemkhumbi lolokufanela kakhulu."" This means booking with a knowledgeable company will match your preferences and abilities with the right boat.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Kubhuka ngemacembu ebangibeli labangu-8+ labatsandza tintfo letifanako:** While traveling with a like-minded group might enhance the experience, the passage does not explicitly state it ensures getting the right ship.
*   **B: Kubhuka ngesikhatsi lapho babancane bantfu labayifunako:** Booking during off-peak season might make booking easier, but it does not ensure getting the ship that best matches your needs.
*   **D: Kusheshe ubhuke:** Booking early secures a spot but doesn't guarantee you'll be on the most suitable vessel.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungasetjentiswa njengelichinga lekugcina tivakashi tigembula?","The correct answer is **B: Tintfo letifana nemathikithi amahhala ekhonsathi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes strategies casinos use to keep visitors gambling longer. These strategies involve manipulating their perception of time and money, providing readily available food, drinks, and entertainment to keep them engaged and in the casino.
*   Options A, C, and D are mentioned in the passage as tactics casinos employ:

    *   A - While not explicitly said, the absence of windows is to control the perception of time.
    *   C - Free drinks are mentioned.
    *   D - No clocks are mentioned.
*   Option B, ""Tintfo letifana nemathikithi amahhala ekhonsathi"" (Things like free concert tickets), directly aligns with the strategy of providing entertainment to keep visitors in the casino and gambling. This would be a way of ensuring the guest stays within the premise of the casino.

Therefore, the best answer is **B**."
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini umuntfu logembulako lohlakaniphile lokufanele ayigweme?","The correct answer is **A: Kunatsa kakhulu tjwala**.

The passage explicitly states that intoxication impairs judgment and that gamblers know the importance of staying sober. Therefore, a smart gambler should avoid excessive alcohol consumption.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguyiphi incenye yenkhulumo lebhalwa ngafeleba ekhatsi nemusho?","The correct answer is **A: Tento**.

The passage states that words next to ""Sie"" (which likely refers to verbs in this context) always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence. This is done to distinguish verbs from other words. Therefore, the passage indicates that **verbs** are capitalized mid-sentence.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini kubhala emabito ngabofeleba lokungayenta ibe lukhuni kakhulu?","The correct answer is **C: Kubhala** (Writing).

The passage states: ""...ngisho noma **kubhala kuba matima** nekutfola sidzingo sekutsi ligama lelisento noma lelisiphawulo lisetjentiswe ngendlela lefanele yini."" This translates to: ""...even though **writing becomes difficult** and finding the need for the verb or adjective to be used in the correct way.""

Therefore, writing in capital letters makes writing more difficult according to the text.
"
"Etincenyeni letisemakhaya teMalaysia, ngusiphi sento lesisho kutsi “kota”?","The passage states: ""...e-Malaysia, lokungenani kuhlanganise bantfu base-Malaysia labasetindzaweni tasemakhaya, kusho kutsi """"wota"""" lokufana nemuno wekukhomba logobene wakhomba umtimba...""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Kugobisa umunwe wekukhomba**.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngusiphi sento lesingase sisho kutsi “buya”?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Kugoba umunwe wekukhomba**.

The passage states that in Malaysia, raising your hand means ""come here,"" similar to a beckoning gesture with a curved index finger.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lebangela kutsi kube netimfa letinkhulu elichweni?","The correct answer is **C: Imihumbe yelichwa lewako** (Ice cave roofs collapsing).

The passage states: ""Emabondza kanye neluphahla lemihume yelichwa angawa kantsi timfa tingavaleka."" This directly translates to ""The walls and roofs of the ice caves may collapse and the crevices may close."" This means the collapsing ice cave roofs are contributing to the changes in the crevices. Therefore, C is the best answer.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokungafihlwa ngema-snow bridges?","The passage states: ""Loku kutobangela kuphahlateka, nekuvuleka kwemhlaba lokungahle kufihlwe mabhuloho elichwa."" This translates to ""This will cause collapse and openings in the ground that **may be hidden by snow bridges**.""

The passage then lists things that could collapse/open:
*   ""Emabondza kanye neluphahla lemihume yelichwa angawa"" - The walls and roof of the ice caves may fall.

The question asks: ""According to the passage, which of the following may be hidden by snow bridges?""

From the passage, the answer is openings in the ground. Among the available options, only tigadla telichwa, in other words big cracks/openings in the ice can be hidden by snow bridges.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Tigadla letinkhulu telichwa**
"
"Ngalokusekelwe kulesicephu, bantfu labahambako kufanele batsatse tinyatselo tekuphepha ngembi kwekuvakashela yiphi indzawo?","The correct answer is **B: Tindzawo letitungelete iGoma**.

The passage states: ""Noma iGoma iphephile ngalokuvakalako, konkhe kuvakashela ngaphandle kwe-Goma kufuna kuhlatiywe kutocondza lesimo sekulwa lesichubekako esifundzaveni saseNyakatfo Kivu.""

This clearly indicates that travel *outside* of Goma requires assessment due to ongoing conflict in the North Kivu province.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungeke kube yithiphu lenhle kumuntfu lovakashela iGoma?,"The best answer is **D: Incenye lephansi yentsabamlilo iNyiragongo itfolakala edolobheni**.

Here's why:

* **A: Timphu letiseNyakatfo YeKivu timnandzi** The passage doesn't discuss weather.
* **B: Yindzawo lekahle naleshiphile Yekucaca Intsaba Ubuke Emagorila** The passage states Goma is a base for tracking gorillas and that this is one of the cheapest places to do so in Africa.
* **C: Ematekisi etidududu ayindlela lekahle yekuhamba** The passage explicitly mentions using ""boda-boda (motorcycle taxis)"" to get around Goma.
* **D: Incenye lephansi yentsabamlilo iNyiragongo itfolakala edolobheni** While Goma is a base for climbing Nyiragongo, the *passage does not state the base is at the foot of the Volcano, just that you can visit the volcano from the city.

Therefore, option D is the statement that is NOT supported by the text and would be a bad tip to give to someone visiting Goma.
"
Kunini lapho itotfolakala khona imvume yasendzaweni yasemakhaya yelilanga lekucala nga-August?,"The correct answer is **B: Nga-April 1**

Here's why:

*   The passage states permits become available on the 1st of the month, four months *prior* to the month you want to camp.
*   To camp in August, you need to count back four months: August -> July -> June -> May -> **April**.
*   Therefore, permits for August camping become available on April 1st."
Ngumuphi umgomo lokhona wekuvikela sihosha?,"The correct answer is **D: Timvume timbalwa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""Timvume tilinganiselwe kuphela kuvikela ikhenyoni."" (Permits are limited solely to protect the canyon). This translates directly to ""Permits are limited"".

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Luhlelo lwemvume loluniketwa labafike kucala** (A permit system offered on a first-come, first-served basis) - While the passage does mention that popular locations fill up quickly on a first-come, first-served basis, this isn't the *primary* goal of the permit system. The *primary* goal is canyon protection.
*   **B: Timvume titfolakala kuphela ngaJanuary 1** (Permits are only available on January 1) - This is incorrect. The passage says permits become available on the first day of the month, four months *after* the initial month.
*   **C: Timvume titrolakala kuphela ngeticelo letentiwa matfupha** (Permits are only available with in-person applications) - The passage does not mention anything about how the applications must be submitted."
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokunematfuba lamancane ekutsi kutfolakale eluhlotjeni lwemahhotela lachazwe kulesicephu?,"The correct answer is **D: Emagumbi lasandza kulungiswa atfutfukiswa ngendlela yesimanje**.

Here's why:

*   **P emphasizes:** The description highlights the importance of antique furnishings, the absence of modern amenities, and the ""lived-in"" feel of these hotels. Newly renovated rooms with modern upgrades would directly contradict this core characteristic.

Let's look at why the other options are more likely:

*   **A: Libhala lema-cocktail:** Cocktail bars were popular during the time periods mentioned (19th and early 20th centuries) and fit the ambiance of luxury and sophistication.
*   **B: Indzawo yekudlela ye-gourmet:** Fine dining has always been associated with high-end hotels, offering a way to cater to wealthy guests and provide a memorable experience.
*   **C: Tivakashi letatiwako naleticashelwako:** The passage states these hotels were frequented by the wealthy and famous, so it would be typical to find notable and discreet guests staying there."
"Ngekuya ngekwatiswa lokukulesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako tivakashi tasehhotela lokunematfuba lamancane ekutsi tikubeke embili?","The passage describes hotels frequented by wealthy and famous individuals, emphasizing their historical significance, antique furnishings, and exclusivity. The passage also mentions that wealthy tourists may choose to travel the world by staying at these hotels.

Considering this, the option least likely to be a priority for guests of these hotels is:

*   **D: Emanani lafinyelelelako emagumbi (Affordable room rates)**

Wealthy travelers who prioritize unique historical experiences, luxury, and exclusivity are unlikely to be concerned about affordability. The other options are more aligned with their preferences: antique furnishings, a restaurant with a famous chef and an entertainment venue.
So the correct answer is D."
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lokufanele igwenywe tivakashi letivakashela iGreenland?","The correct answer is **D: Kubhekisela kubantfu bemdzabu baseGreenland ngekutsi ngema-”Eskimo”**.

The passage explicitly states that while the term ""Eskimo"" might be acceptable in America, it is considered offensive to Arctic peoples who are not American, particularly in Canada. It advises visitors to Greenland to avoid using the term.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokunematfuba lamanyenti ekutsi kube yinkinga kubantfu labavakashela iGreenland bangakatilungiseleli?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Simo selitulu (The weather)**

Here's why:

*   **Simo selitulu (The weather):** The passage explicitly states that the weather is the primary danger visitors are unprepared for. It further elaborates on the need for warm clothing in winter and potential sleep disruption in summer due to long daylight hours.

The other options are less likely to be a problem for unprepared tourists based on the text:

*   **A: Timbuzulwane lokutsiwa ngemaNordic (Nordic mosquitoes):** While the passage mentions the annoyance of Nordic mosquitoes, it states that they do not transmit diseases.
*   **B: Bugebengu (Crime):** The passage states that crime is not a significant issue in Greenland, particularly compared to other countries.
*   **D: Bantfu bendzawo (Local people):** The passage warns about the term ""Eskimo"" but does not indicate that the local population would pose a problem to tourists."
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako nyalo lokusetjentiswa njengendzawo yetitolo?,"Based on the provided text:

*   **Jardin de la Union** is now a central plaza with many events happening, and restaurants surrounding it.
*   **Callejon del Beso** (Alley of the Kiss) is a narrow alley famous for a love story.
*   **Templo de San Diego** is the only remaining structure from a former complex.

The description of the Jardin de la Union matches the concept of a central plaza with nearby restaurants, so the correct answer is:

**A: I-Jardín de la Unión**
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungatfolakali e-Jardín de la Unión?","Based on the provided text:

*   **Jardín de la Unión** has many restaurants surrounding the garden.
*   There are many events, day and night.
*   There are free concerts in the evenings.
*   **Callejon del Beso (Liphaseji Lekucabuza)** is where you can find the love stories.
*   **Templo de San Diego** is an old religious building.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: Sakhiwo lesizala sebantfu labashintje inkholo (Building that houses people who changed religion).**

The text mentions the Templo de San Diego as a remaining structure from a former priest's residence, not a building specifically for converts.
"
"Ngalokusekelwe kulesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako mayelana neluhambo lwelilanga langase atsatfwe njengalangasilo liciniso?","Based on the passage, the statement that is **not** true is:

**D: Kuhamba emini akusiyo intfo lekahle leyentiwa ngaphandle kumindeni lenebantfwane**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Imindeni lenebantfwana labancane ingase idzinge kulungiselela kakhudlwana, kodvwa lilanga linye nje ungephandle lingatilungela ngisho netinswane nebantfwana labasafundza enkhulisa."" (Families with young children may need extra preparation, but a day trip can work for even toddlers and pre-schoolers.)

The passage explicitly says that families with young children can enjoy day hikes, although they might need to prepare more. Therefore, option D contradicts the information provided in the passage.
Options A, B and C are true as the passage mentions that very little preparation is needed for easy trails, distances vary but can be covered in a day, and that people of average fitness can enjoy day hikes."
"Ngekwalesicephu, kunini lapho luhambo lwasemini ludzinga khona kutilungiselela lokuncane?","The correct answer is **A: Nangabe loyo lohambako acinile emtimbeni**.

The passage states that ""Kukhuphuka intsaba lilanga lonkhe uhamba endzaweni lengasimatima kangako kudzinga kulungiselela lokuncane, futsi noma ngubani lophilile ngekwelizinga lelisesilinganisweni angakujabulela."" This directly connects being reasonably fit with needing less preparation for a day hike.
"
Uyini umehluko etsafeni laseRogaland nome Agder nalicatsaniswa nayo yonkhe iNorway?,"The correct answer is **D: Sikhatsi lesinyenti avalwe sitjalo lokutsiwa yi-heather**.

The passage states that in Rogaland and Agder, such areas are called ""hei"" which means treeless areas covered in heather. This distinguishes them from the general ""vidde"" of Norway, which is described as a large, open, treeless area without vegetation limits, but not specifically mentioned as being covered in heather.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kulolu lokulandzelako lokungeke kube ngulokujwayelekile ngeNorway?","The correct answer is **B: Ematsafa emahlatsi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes open, treeless landscapes (""yi-vidde"" and ""hei"") and fjords.
*   It mentions moors (""hei"" covered in heather).
*   It does *not* mention forest plains as a typical feature."
Kunini lapho tivakashi letinesifiso sekuntjuza echweni letingavakashela khona titeshi letisegcumeni?,"The correct answer is **A: Ebusika**.

The passage states: ""Kunebuhle nekutsandzeka lokuhlukile ebusika, titeshi temadvwala titfola sitfwatfwa lesanele futsi kunetintfo letinengi longatenta kufaka ekhatsi imidlalo yasesitfwatfweni."" This translates to: ""There is different beauty and charm in winter, the hill stations get enough snow and there are many things you can do including snow games."" This directly implies that winter is the time when people interested in snow activities should visit.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kunini lapho kuba netivakashi letinyenti khona etiteshini letisegcumeni?","The correct answer is **C: Ngesikhatsi selihloba laseNdiya** (During the Indian summer).

The passage states: ""Linani letivakashi letiya endzaweni lesemagcumeni yaseNdiya tiba tinyenti ehlobo."" which translates to ""The number of tourists visiting the hill stations of India is very high in summer.""
"
Yini lokufanele ugweme kuyenta nawunelitsemba lekutfola sikebhe lesifuna lusito?,"Based on the passage, the best answer is **D: Kungabanaki labanye labacela kugibela tikebhe**.

The passage emphasizes the importance of talking to *as many people as possible* and getting your name and abilities known. Ignoring potential crew members on other boats would directly contradict this strategy. The passage suggests you should try to speak to as many people as possible, and this includes other people looking for boat work. Therefore, ignoring people looking for the same thing is not something you should do when looking for a boat to work on.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Kwehla wenyuka kuma-dock** (Wandering around the docks): The passage explicitly advises to ""hambahambe etikebheni"", which translates to wandering around the boats.
*   **B: Kutayelana nabokaputeni** (Familiarizing yourself with captains): The passage encourages talking to captains.
*   **C: Kukhangisa ngemsebenti lowentako** (Advertising the work you do): The passage specifically states ""ngekwesisekelo utofaka timemetelo letikhombisa kutsi ungasita"", which means posting announcements or spreading the word about your skills."
Yini lokufanele uyente nawuseceleni kwebashayeli betikebhe nawusafuna tikembe letidzinga lusito endzaweni yekupaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Chumana nebashayeli bemikhumbi**.

The passage explicitly advises you to ""try to talk to boat captains in the liquor selling area.""  This directly translates to contacting (Chumana) boat captains. The other options are contrary to the advice given in the text.
"
Nguyiphi indzawo lengakhanga tivakashi letinesifiso sekutfola umlandvo wekubuswa kwesichingi?,"The correct answer is **A: Lugu loluseNyakatfo (The North Coast)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Liningi lelikhulu lentfutfuko yasemadolobheni yesichingi iHong Kong, ligcwele ngekuminyana emhlabeni lophindze watsatfwa ngasegwini lelisenyakatfo. Lena yindzawo lapho baseBrithani labangena ngenkhani kuyo bayenta yabo ngako ngangabe ufuna bufakazi balendzawo kutsi yatsatfwa ngubani ekucaleni, lena yindzawo lekahle longacala kuyo.""

This directly connects the North Coast to the history of British influence and colonization, making it the place where tourists interested in this history should start.
"
Nguyiphi indzawo lengakhanga sivakashi lesitsandza indzawo lenhle?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Indzawo lengaselwandle lokutsitwa yi-Kowloon**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kuyibukela kahle i Hong Kong, shiya lesichingi uchubeke uye e Kowloon waterfront lebukene naso.""  This translates to: ""To view Hong Kong well, leave the city and proceed to the Kowloon waterfront facing it."" This directly suggests that Kowloon waterfront is a good place to see a beautiful view of Hong Kong.

Yini letinye tihlalo temahhashi letinayo kuze tivikele kutsi lunyawo lwemgibeli lubanjwe yifulemu yekufaka tinyawo?,"Based on the passage provided, the answer is **B: Tindvuku tekuphepha (Safety bars)**.

The passage states that English saddles have ""safety bars that cause the leather stirrup to fall away from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider."" This describes the function of safety bars - to release the stirrup in a dangerous situation.
"
Ngusiphi sici selibhudzi lemgibeli welihhasi lesikhulisa lizinga lekuphepha nakasebentisa emafulemu ekufaka tinyawo?,"The correct answer is **C: Sitsendze**.

The passage states: ""Kwekucala, bagibeli labanyenti bagcoka emabhudze lanesitsedze"" which translates to ""First, many riders wear boots with heels."" The passage implies that wearing boots with heels is a safety precaution.

Yini leniketwa tivakashi kusetjentiswa emanethiwekhi etekuvakasha?,"The correct answer is **A: Tindzawo tekuhlala lapho labanakekela tivakashi kubantfu bendzawo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the network connects travelers with locals in the cities they are visiting. The example of Casey Fenton shows that the initial need was for a place to stay, and he found free accommodations with locals.
*   While Casey found a cheap flight (B), that's not the primary focus or offering of the hospitality network itself.
*   While C and D can be an advantage, the definition of the Hospitality exchange network is the places to stay."
"Ngalokusekelwe kulesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako mayelana nemanethiwekhi etekuvakasha?","Based on the text provided, the correct answer is:

*   **B: Lamanye emanethiwekhi angase adzinge kucinisekiswa lokwengetiwe kwetivakashi**

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Kujoyina le-network kudzinga nje kugcwalisa lifomu nge-inthanethi; noma lamanye ema-network aniketa noma adzinga lolunye luhlolo."" This directly supports the idea that some networks might require additional screening or verification.

Here's why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: Tivakashi ngaso sonkhe sikhatsi tinikwa imininingwane yebantfu bendzawo labatotisita:** The text states that the list is only ""ngaletinye tikhatsi linemininingwane letsite luphindze lubuketwe ngulabahambele."" It doesn't happen *always*.
*   **C: Tivakashi titawunikwa luhla lwebantfu labatotisita labakhona kulelidolobha letiya kulo:** Similar to A, the text says that this list is sometimes available; it isn't guaranteed.
*   **D: Kuphawula lokwentiwa mayelana nebantfu bendzawo labanakekela tivakashi kuyatfolakala ngaletinye tikhatsi:** The text states ""linemininingwane letsite luphindze lubuketwe ngulabahambele"", which can be interpreted as feedback, but it doesn't mean its *always* available."

Therefore, the answer is **C: Shukela wekhokhonathi**.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, sifo lesitsatsalwanako sandza kanjani?","The correct answer is **B: Emagciwane lokutsiwa ngema-pathogen** (Germs called pathogens).

The passage states that a ""sifo lesitsatselwanako"" (communicable disease) is caused by germs, which includes viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites. ""Emagciwane lokutsiwa ngema-pathogen"" is the closest translation of ""disease-causing germs"" or ""pathogens"".
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lebeyingatiwa kutsi ibangela sifo lesitsatselwanako?","The correct answer is **B: Emagciwane**, **C: Emabhakthira**, and **D: Kukhuntsa**.

The passage states: ""Sifo lesitsatselwanako sifo lesibangwa ligciwane kungaba yivariyasi ibhakthiriya ifangasi noma tilwanyana letimunya ingati.""

This means that viruses (emagciwane), bacteria (emabhakthira), and fungi (kukhuntsa) can all cause communicable diseases. Option A, ""Kugoma"" (Vaccination), is a preventative measure against disease, not a cause.
"
Kukusiphi simo lapho kukhetsa khona i-web proxy kune-VPN kwenele kumuntfu?,"The correct answer is **C: Lomuntfu ngalokuyinhloko ukhatsateke ngekuhambiswa kwatiswa kwe-http.**

Here's why:

* **VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)** encrypt *all* your internet traffic and route it through a remote server. This provides comprehensive privacy and security, making it suitable for situations where you want to hide all your online activity, bypass censorship, or protect sensitive data.  They handle all types of internet traffic, not just HTTP.

* **Web proxies** only route your HTTP (and sometimes HTTPS) traffic through a proxy server. They are less comprehensive than VPNs.  They are useful for basic anonymity and bypassing simple restrictions, but they don't encrypt all your traffic.

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umuntfu ufuna kuphambukisa konkhe kwatiswa:**  A VPN is better for this, as it routes all traffic.
* **B: Umuntfu ukhatsate kakhulu ngekuvinjelwa nekuhlolwa kwetintfo takhe:**  While a web proxy can help with this to some extent, a VPN provides much stronger protection against censorship and surveillance because it encrypts all traffic.
* **D: Lokwentiwa ngulomuntfu kudzinga i-bandwidth lenemandla lasetulu ngalokusesilinganisweni:** A VPN might be preferable here, as some proxies can be slower and introduce bandwidth bottlenecks. However, this isn't directly related to *why* a proxy would be *sufficient* versus a VPN.  If performance is critical, and the only concern is HTTP traffic, a well-optimized proxy *could* be sufficient, but a VPN is generally better for sustained high-bandwidth activities.

Therefore, if the user's primary concern is simply masking HTTP traffic, a web proxy is sufficient, and a VPN might be overkill.  This is because HTTP is what is used for browsing most websites. Option C captures the reason for choosing a proxy as opposed to a VPN best.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langasilo liciniso mayelana nema-VPN nema-web proxies?","Impendvulo lecondzile ngu **D: Ema-VPN angahambisa kwatiswa kwe-http kuphela.**

"
Yini levumela umuntfu kutsi asebentise inkapani yelucingo ngephandle kwendzawo lahlala kuyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Tincingo letihanjiswa nge-inthanethi**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngoba tincingo tihlanganiswe ne-Inthanethi, akunasidzingo sekutsi usebentise lucingo lenkhampani yalapho uhlala khona noma lapho uvakasha khona."" This directly links the use of a phone company outside of one's location to the internet-based phone system.

"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lokungase kudzingeke yentiwe kuze kungene letinye tincingo?","The correct answer is **A: Tsenga inombolo yemhlaba wonkhe**.

The passage states: ""Esikhatsini lesinyenti, kufuneka utsenge inombolo yamhlabawonkhe levumela tincingo tePSTN kutsi tikushayele."" This directly indicates that a global number is often required to receive calls from PSTN lines.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungayichazi kahle indlela yekubita emagama esiTaliyane?,"Impendvulo lengiyo ngu: **D: Indlela emagama lamanyenti labitwa ngayo iyahluka kuye ngankhamisa lolandzelako**

This sentence tells us that the red-tiled roofs are original, meaning they predate the modern buildings and shopping centers. The other options are characteristics of modern cities.

The passage states ""Kubona timbali tetihlahla letinyenti endzaweni yinye, letatiwa ngekutsi i-hanami..."". While the passage mentions plum blossoms being important in China initially, it is cherry blossoms that are associated with Hanami in Japan.
"
Ngubani lowabamba imicimbi yekucala leyayentelwe kubukwa kwema-cherry blossoms?,"The correct answer is **C: Umbusi waseJapane**.

The passage states: ""EJapan, emaphathi ekucala umhleli wawo bekuba ngumbusi...nalamanye emalunga ebukhosi eceleni kweNkantolo Yasebukhosini."" This directly says the first parties were organized by the Emperor of Japan.

Here's why:

*   **A: Kubaluleka kwalelidolobha kutenkholo:** The passage explicitly states Jerusalem's religious significance makes it a major tourist attraction.
*   **C: Emasiko alo:** The passage mentions culture as a central aspect of Jerusalem.
*   **D: Tindzawo letinyenti temlandvo:** The passage emphasizes Jerusalem's rich history, archaeological sites, and cultural landmarks, making it a key draw for tourists.
*   **B: Kuba kwalo lidolobha lelikhulu ka-Israyeli:** While mentioned, the passage also notes that Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital is disputed internationally. The fact that it's the capital *itself* is less of a tourist draw compared to its religious, historical, and cultural significance."
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungakashiwo kulesicephu njengentfo iJerusalema leyatiwa ngayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Emandla ayo kutepolitiki**

Here's why:

*   **Umlandvo wayo lomangalisako (A):** The passage directly mentions Jerusalem's amazing history dating back thousands of years.
*   **Kubaluleka kwayo kutenkholo (C):** The passage states that Jerusalem is sacred to three monotheistic religions and serves as a spiritual and religious center.
*   **Tindzawo temasiko (D):** The passage mentions cultural sites, historical remains, and museums.

The passage focuses on Jerusalem's history, religious significance, and cultural attractions, but it does not specifically mention its political power or influence. While it notes that some countries don't recognize it as Israel's capital, it doesn't detail the extent or nature of Jerusalem's political clout.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi luhlobo lwesivakashi lolungeke luzuze ngekutsenga i-Wild Card?","The correct answer is **B: Sivakasi lesivakashela i-Kruger National Park kuphela.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that a Wild Card allows entry to *multiple* selected South African National Parks, or *all* South African National Parks.
*   A visitor only going to Kruger National Park wouldn't benefit from the Wild Card because they'd be paying for access to parks they aren't visiting.
*   The other options are likely to benefit, since a Wild Card would either save them money or allow them access to the parks they want to visit."
Ngumaphi emavi langayichazi kahle i-Kruger National Park?,"The correct answer is **B: Tilwane tiyehlukahlukana etindzaweni letinyenti talephaki**.

Here's why:

*   **B: Tilwane tiyehlukahlukana etindzaweni letinyenti talephaki** - The passage states that the park is divided into 14 sections, and ""incenye ngayinye ineluhlobo lolutsite letilwane tasendle"", meaning each section has unique wildlife. This means tilwane tiyehlukahlukana etindzaweni letinyenti talephaki.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ibhekwa njengendzawo lehamba embili eNingizimu Afrikha ngekukhanga tivakashi** - While the passage mentions it's a popular tourist destination, it says that it is ""ngulenye yetindzawo letitsakatelisako"", not the most popular tourist attraction.
*   **C: Iyiphaki lencane kunato tonkhe e-South African National Parks** - The passage says that the park is 19,500 km², this means that this is a very large park, not a small park.
*   **D: Tivakashi tiyakhona kungena kuyo ngekutsi titsenge i-Wild Card** - The passage says that, ""Kungase kuzuzise nekutsi utsenge Likhadi Lasendle, lelenta kutsi ungene emapaki lakhetsiwe eNingizimu Afrika noma kuwo onkhe emaPaki Esive eNingizimu Afrika."" This statement does not directly states that tivakashi tiyakhona kungena kuyo ngekutsi titsenge i-Wild Card.

Here's why:

*   **A: Ngisho nebacanci labanemandla kungenteka baphelelwe ngumoya** - The passage doesn't say that even the strongest climbers will get winded. It simply says to expect to get winded (""lindzela kuphelelwa ngumoya""), implying it's a common experience, regardless of fitness level.

*   **B: Kute kwekubambelela kuto tonkhe tincenye letehlelako** - The passage says, ""... lapho kukhuphukela khona tinsimbi tekubambelela tiniketa indzawo yekubambelela lesekalanako."" It does not state there are handrails for *all* sections.

*   **C: Kufanele wendlule umhume etulu** - The passage explicitly mentions that there is a small cave near the top that you must crawl through (""Kunemhume lomncane eceleni kwalapha etulu lokufanele wendlule kuwo..."").

*   **D: Tindzawo letehlelako tiba yingoti nakumanti** - The passage warns that the climb can be dangerous quickly if it's wet (""...kukhulukati uma kunemanti, njengoba kungaba yingoti masinyane"")."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungasiyo intfo lehamba embili ekudleni kwesi-Majorcan ?","The correct answer is **C: Lokusanhlavu** (C: Seafood).

The passage mentions bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) as staples of Majorcan cuisine. It does not mention seafood as a primary component, though it does say tuna *can* be used as a topping for Pa amb Oli. Therefore, seafood is the least central to the description of Majorcan food provided.

Yini lengase iholele ekucashelweni lokukhetsekile kwe-monk nome i-nun?,"Based on the text, the answer is **D: Kugcoka siketi lesifika ngetulu kwemadvolo**.

The passage states that visitors to religious sites (implicitly referring to houses of worship) need to cover their knees and shoulders. Women are required to wear skirts or wraps that cover their knees, so a skirt that is above the knee would be a violation of this dress code and could lead to being singled out or disapproved of.

Kunini lapho lucingo lwesethelayithi lungeke lulunge khona kutsasa sikhundla samahlalekhikhini?,"The correct answer is **A: Nangabe umugcwa wesethelayithi wekubuka ungase uvimbeke** (When the satellite line of sight might be blocked).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Lucingo lwesathelayithi alitsatsi sikhala sefoni yamakhala ekhikhini, njengobe kufanele uphumele ngaphandle lakute khona lokungavimba isathelayithi kute ukhone kufona."" (A satellite phone doesn't replace a cell phone, as you have to go outside where nothing can block the satellite so you can call.)
*   This directly implies that if the satellite's line of sight is blocked (e.g., by buildings, mountains, dense forests), the satellite phone will not work.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Nangabe lendzawo ichele kakhulu** (When the area is very expensive): The cost of the area is not mentioned.
*   **C: Nangabe lutosetjentiswa ngephandle** (When it will be used outside): The phone is designed to be used outside.
*   **D: Nangabe luhambo lunetidzingo letitsite temadatha** (When the journey has specific data requirements): The journey having data requirements does not affect the ability to use the satelite phone."
Kunini lapho lucingo lwesethelayithi lungaba ncono khona kunamahlalekhikhini?,"The correct answer is **B: Eluhambeni lwesikebhe**.

The passage states that satellite phones are used ""ngulabo labahambisa tintfo, kuhlanganise nemikhumbi yekungcebeleka"" (by those who transport things, including recreational ships). This directly implies that a satellite phone is a better option on a boat trip, especially when cell phone service is unavailable.

"Ngekwalesicephu, kunini lapho umuntfu kufanele avakashele khona iMontevideo nangabe afuna kubalekela umoya?","The passage states:

*   Montevideo is in the Southern Hemisphere, so its seasons are opposite to the Northern Hemisphere.
*   When it's summer in Montevideo, it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
*   Winter in Montevideo can be windy and feel colder than the thermometer reading.

Therefore, to avoid the wind, one should visit Montevideo when it's not winter there. Since Montevideo's summer is the Northern Hemisphere's winter, the best time to visit to avoid wind would be during **A: Ngetinyanga tasebusika eNyakatfo Yemhlaba (During the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere)**."

The other options are mentioned, but not as something many attendees consider a key part of the *experience* of the festival itself:
*   Bringing small children (A) is mentioned as some festivals having designated camping areas, but isn't presented as a widely enjoyed aspect.
*   Music playing late (C) is true but not mentioned as a reason that many people are considering a part of the festival.
*   Arriving early (D) is a suggestion to do so, so you can be in a better camping location, but is not something that is a part of the festival."

*   The passage specifically mentions that ""Bantfu base Australia abalitayeli likhofi lelimhlophe betayele likhofi lelimnyama i-'espresso' necappuccino lenekhrimu,"" which translates to ""Australians don't usually drink white coffee, they drink black coffee, espresso, or cappuccino with cream.""

*   A flat white is a coffee drink that contains milk. This would be unusual according to the passage.

The other options are less likely to cause confusion:

*   **A: Likhofi i-short black:** The passage does state that Australians like black coffee, meaning a short black would be acceptable.
*   **B: Sinatfo lokutsiwa yi-Number One:** The passage explicitly names ""Number One"" as a popular local beer, so ordering it wouldn't be confusing.
*   **C: I-Sauvignon Blanc yaseNew Zealand:** The passage recommends paying attention to wines from New Zealand and Australia, so ordering a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc would be reasonable."
"Njengobe satsatsa emakhulu lamatsatfu eminyaka, sikhatsi sekubusa kwemakoloni sacalwa nguliphi licembu?","The correct answer is **D: The Spaniards**.

The passage states that ""Base-Spain bacala kungena emaveni latsite bawabuse sikhatsi lesaba ngemakhulu lamatsatfu"" which translates to ""The Spaniards began to enter some lands and rule them for three centuries."" This clearly indicates that the colonial rule was started by the Spaniards.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu,nguyiphi indlela lencono yekwenta umuntfu waseParis kutsi akhululeke kuwe?","The correct answer is **C: Bani nenhlonipho**

The passage states: ""Simo sangaphakatsi sabantfu baseParis siyancibilika nangabe ubabonisa inhlonipho."" This directly translates to ""The inner nature of Parisians melts when you show them respect."" Therefore, showing respect is the best way to get a Parisian to warm up to you.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kulolu lokulandzelako lokungatsatfwa njengembono longashintji mayelana nebantfu baseParis?","The correct answer is **A: Kutikhukhumeta**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Parisians are known for being self-centered (""kuticabangela bona""), which is directly related to being arrogant or conceited (""kutikhukhumeta"").
*   The passage also mentions they can be disrespectful (""kungabi nanhlonipho"") and greedy (""kuhaha"").
*   The passage never mentions any aspects of being being blue, playful, or unpredictable.
"
Iyini inzuzo yeLizinga Lekucala Etitimeleni taseCape Town?,"The correct answer is **B: Kute bantfu labanyenti kakhulu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""IMetroPlus ihlalisekile futsi ayikagcwali"" which translates to ""MetroPlus is comfortable and not crowded"". This directly supports option B.
*   The passage states that ""ema-MetroPlus ngaso sonkhe sikhatsi atfolakala ekugcineni kwesitimela dvutane naseCape Town."" The passage does not state that the location is the ""embili kwesitimela"".
*   The passage states that ""IMetroPlus ihlalisekile futsi ayikagcwali kodvwa iyabita kancane"" which translates to ""MetroPlus is comfortable and not crowded but is a little more expensive"". This directly goes against option C.
*   The passage states that ""IMetroPlus ihlalisekile futsi ayikagcwali kodvwa iyabita kancane"" which translates to ""MetroPlus is comfortable and not crowded but is a little more expensive"". This directly goes against option D."
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini sitimela sebagibeli eCape Town lesinayo?","The correct answer is **D: Kokubili ematilogo elizinga Lekucala neLesitsatfu**

The passage clearly states that the IMetroRail has two classes: MetroPlus (First Class) and Metro (Third Class). Therefore, the train has both First and Third class carriages.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako tinambutane lokunematfuba lamancane ekutsi tikwente?,"Based on the provided text, the passage implies that dangerous wild animals are unlikely to be kept as pets. It states that pets can cause skin irritation, allergic reactions, spread diseases, or even cause serious injury or death.

Considering this:

*   **A: Kubangela kucubuka (Causing skin irritation):** Pets can cause skin irritation through bites, scratches, or allergies.
*   **B: Kubangela ema-aleji (Causing allergies):** Pets are a common source of allergies.
*   **C: Kwandzisa ligciwane (Spreading disease):** Pets can transmit diseases.
*   **D: Kubangela kulimala lokunemandla (Causing serious injury):** Dangerous wild animals are more likely to cause serious injury.

Therefore, the answer is **D: Kubangela kulimala lokunemandla**. The passage is implicitly arguing that dangerous animals likely to cause serious injury should *not* be kept as pets, suggesting that this is a less likely scenario than the other options."
Atsengwa kuphi emakhadi elucingo lakhokhelwa kusengaphambili?,"The passage doesn't explicitly state *where* to buy the cards. It focuses on how the cards work and their benefits. Therefore, none of the given options can be definitively confirmed based on the provided text.

However, logically, based on common knowledge about prepaid phone cards, **C: Etitolo letincane (Small shops/Convenience Stores)** is the most likely place to find them.
"
Atfolakala kanjani emanani lancono ekushaya tincingo ngalamanye emakhadi ?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **B: Ngetinombolo letishayela mahhala** (Through toll-free numbers).

The passage states: ""Letinsita tivamise kufinyeleleka ngekushayela inombolo lengabhadalelwa longayishayela ngetincingo letinyenti ngaphandle kwekubhadala."" This directly translates to the services being accessible by dialing a toll-free number, which you can dial from most phones without paying.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngusiphi kuletihlahla letilandzelako lesingakavami e-Plitvice Lakes national park?","The passage mentions beech and fir trees as being common in Plitvice Lakes National Park. It does *not* mention oak or spruce. Therefore, the best answer is **B: I-oak**.
"
Ngutiphi kuletilwane letingakavami letitfolakalako e-Plitvice Lakes national park?,"The correct answer is **D: I-capercaillie**

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions several animals found in Plitvice Lakes National Park, including the brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, and capercaillie.
*   Sambane, ingalukhuni and cassowary are not mentioned in the passage."
"Ngekwalesicephu, emakhodi etifundza asita kuphi?","The correct answer is **B: Kulawula imakethe**.

The passage explicitly states that the ""real purpose is to give companies control of their markets; it's all about making money.""  The passage also argues that the codes don't prevent illegal copying, and therefore options A, C, and D are incorrect.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungemanga mayelana nemakhodi esifundza futsi lasakatwa tinkapani tetindzaba?","The correct answer is **B: Asita ekuvikeleni kukopisha lokungekho emtsetfweni**

Here's why:

*   The passage directly states that the codes ""akanawo umtselela ekukopeni ngalokungekho emtsetfweni"" (have no impact on illegal copying). Therefore, claiming they help prevent illegal copying is false.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ayadzingeka kuze ulawule imakhethe lenkhulu:** The passage implies that the main intention of those codes is to ""kunika tinkampani kulawula timaketse tato"" which means to control their markets.

*   **C: Alusito ekwakheni imali:** The passage strongly suggests that the ultimate goal of the codes is financial, stating ""konkhe kumayelana nekushintjana ngemali"" (it's all about exchanging money). Therefore, the codes help companies make money.

*   **D: Akavamisile kuvikela bugebengu:** The passage indicates the codes are presented as helping to ""tivembela bugebengu"" (fight piracy).

So, option B is the only one that the passage explicitly states is untrue."
"Nawufika eveni lakini, nguyiphi inchubo ngalokuvamile lengakahleleki?","The answer is **A: Kuhlolwa kwalabangenako (Inspection of travellers)**

The passage states: ""Noma-nje kuhlolwa kweteluhambo ngalokuvamile kungekho noma kwenta ngekuhleleka nawufika eveni lakini..."". This translates to ""Although traveller inspections are usually non-existent or done randomly when you arrive in the country..."". Therefore, the process that is usually not well organized upon arrival is the inspection of travelers.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokufanele ukwati ngembi kwekufika eveni lakini?,"The passage says:

*   Immigration checks are usually not strict upon arrival.
*   Customs control can still be a hassle.
*   Know what you can and cannot carry.
*   Declare everything legally.

Therefore, the answer is **D: Nangabe lokutsite lokuphetse kungakavumeleki** (Whether something you possess may not be allowed). The passage emphasizes the importance of knowing what is allowed and what is not allowed to be carried into the country.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, bunyenti bani lobenta kutsi bantfu labacancako bahlale batfola tindlela letinsha eSigodzingi SaseCochamó?","The correct answer is **C: Sicongo (Sicongweni)**.

The passage states, ""Bantfu labacanca tintsaba labavela emhlabeni wonkhe bahlale batfola tindlela letinsha tekuyofika **etulu**."" ""Etulu"" here refers to the summit or peak of the mountain.
"
"Ngalokusekelwe ekwatisweni lokukulesicephu, ngubani lohlanganisa tindzawo letiwelwa kakhulu eNingizimu Yenkhaba Yemhlaba?","The correct answer is **B: I-Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Star Alliance ihlanganisa konkhe ngaphandle kwemphumalanga Ningizimu Pacific kusukela eSantiago de Chile kuya eTahiti."" This means it covers most of the significant crossing points in the Southern Hemisphere.
*   The passage directly says SkyTeam does not cover even one of the crossing points.
*   LATAM Oneworld only covers the specific Santiago to Tahiti route, not a broader range of crossings.
*   South Pacific is a geographical region, not an airline alliance.
"
Ngutiphi tindiza letiwela kancane eNingizimu Yenkhaba Yemhlaba?,"The correct answer is **A: I-Star Alliance**.

The passage states that Star Alliance covers everything except the eastern South Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti. The other options are either locations or airlines, not alliances.
"
Nguyiphi inhlangano yekuvakasha lephumelele i-Global Running Tours?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Go Running Tours**.

The passage states ""I-Go Running Tours letsetse sikhundla seGlobal Running Tours..."" which means Go Running Tours took over Global Running Tours.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, i-Go Running Tours isita ekuhlanganiseni tinhlangano letingakhi tekugijima ube ubuka tindzawo?","The correct answer is **D: Letintsatfu**

Here's why:

The passage mentions Go Running Tours bringing together:

1. Barcelona's Running Tours Barcelona
2. Copenhagen's Running Copenhagen
3. Running Tours Prague

Therefore, the answer is 3."
Yini lokufanele sivakashi siyente nasinelitsemba lekubona kahle lihlosi?,"The correct answer is **C: Sebentisa tibonakudze (Use binoculars)**.

The passage states: ""Emabhubhesi tinhlosi kanye netingwe ngaletinye tikhatsi tiba nemahloni tibonakala kahle nawutibuka ngetipopolo.""  (Lions, leopards, and cheetahs are sometimes shy and are seen best with binoculars.)
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi luhlobo lwesilwane sivakashi lokungenteka sisibone nasisahamba ngemoti?","The correct answer is **B: Tindlulamitsi**.

The passage states: ""Letinye tilwane, letifaka ekhatsi tindlovu netindlulamitsi, titsandza kusondzela etimotweni futsi loko kungasibangela kutsi sitibone kahle.""  This directly indicates giraffes are likely to approach vehicles. The other animals are said to be shy and better viewed with binoculars, suggesting they are less likely to approach a vehicle.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengehlisa imali yeluhambo?","The correct answer is **B: Kutfola licembu lalabane (Finding a group of four)**.

The passage explicitly states that the price per person is cheaper when traveling in a group and recommends forming a group of four to six people.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngubani longaba nenhlanhla yekutfola imali yekuvakasha lencono?","Impendvulo lelungile ngu: **D: Licembu lalabasihlanu**

Lendzaba itsi kuvakasha kuyashipha uma kunebantfu labaningi. Iphindze itsi kuba ncono kuba nelicembu lelinebantfu labane kuya kulabasitfupha, ngoba yiyo leyo linani lelishipha imali lelibhadalwa ngumuntfu ngamunye. Kuloko, licembu lalabasihlanu lingaphakatsi kwalelizinga."
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini leyafaka sandla ekutsi i-San Francisco icashelwe emhlabeni wonkhe?","The answer is **A: Kuba khona njalo etinhlotjeni letehlukehlukene temaciko netindzaba.**

The passage states, ""Kuvetwa lokuvamile kwemiculo, emafilimu, tincwadzi kanye nemasiko lavamile kusite ekwenteni lelidolobha latiwe emhlabeni wonkhe."" (The frequent exposure of music, films, books, and popular culture has helped make the city known worldwide.) This directly supports option A.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langasilo liciniso mayelana ne-San Francisco?","The correct answer is **D: Umnotfo usekelwe tekuvakasha ngalokuphelele**.

Here's why:

* **P states that the San Francisco economy is diverse, with major sectors including professional services, government, finance, trade, and tourism.** This directly contradicts the idea that the economy is *entirely* based on tourism. The other options are supported by the passage.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi luhlobo lwesivakashi lokute ematfuba ekutsi luzuze ngekusebentisa inkapani yekuvakasha?","The correct answer is **B: Sivakashi lesitsambekele ekutentakaleleni kwetintfo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage highlights that travel agencies offer benefits like convenience (knowing you have a place to stay), deals (discounts), bundled services (flights, hotels, meals, transfers), and flexibility (holding reservations).

*   A tourist that wants to do things by themselves will probably not use the service because the tourist agency offers benefits that only apply to people that use the agency to plan travels."
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungakashiwo kulesicephu njengenzuzo yekubhuka usebentisa inkapani yekuvakasha?,"The correct answer is **A: Timphepha tekuhamba letisheshisiwe**.

Here's why:

*   **B: Emadili lashisako:** The passage mentions that travel agents are often given discounts at hotels. This relates to deals.
*   **C: Emaphakheji lafaka konkhe:** The passage explicitly says that travel services can include things like breakfast, airport transfers, and even bundled flights and hotels. This is what an all-inclusive package is.
*   **D: Kubamba indzawo:** The passage states that travel agents can hold a reservation for you while you get your travel documents sorted.

The passage doesn't mention anything about travel companies speeding up the process of getting travel documents like visas. Therefore, ""Timpepha tekuhamba letisheshisiwe"" is not mentioned as a benefit."
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini tinhlelo tekuhumusha lokubhaliwe letingakhoni kuyenta?","The correct answer is **D: Kuhumusha kahle ngaso sonkhe sikhatsi**.

The passage explicitly states ""kuyadzinga kutsi kucashwe, ngoba kungenteka lokuhunyushiwe kungabi ngiko,"" which means that translations may not always be accurate.
"
Yini levumela kutsi kuhunyushwe nawungekho ku-inthanethi?,"The correct answer is **C: Kudawuniloda kwatiswa kwelulimi**

The passage explicitly states that Google Translate allows offline translation *after* you download the language data.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungabangeli kuwa kwelichwa entsabeni?,"The correct answer is **A: Lichwa lelinamatsele**.

The passage states that the stickiness of the snow/ice *causes* the need for it to be disturbed to fall, but it's not a *cause* of the avalanche itself. The other options (people, sunlight, and further snow/ice falling) are all explicitly mentioned as potential triggers.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokwenhla njengengelichwa leliwa entsabeni?","The passage says that avalanches are common in steep areas, but mostly happen downhill. It also mentions that avalanches stick together and need a trigger to fall, and that this trigger can be things like sunlight warming the snow, large snowfalls, or natural disasters, *especially people*.

The question asks which of the following could cause an avalanche? Of the provided options, the best answer is:

*   **A: Lichwa lelinamatsele lelingabangelwanga** - This translates to ""Snow that sticks together that is unprovoked"". The passage says that avalanches need to be ""provoked"" to fall.
Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tindzawo letehlelako letite lichwa** - This translates to ""Steep areas without snow"". If there is no snow, there can't be an avalanche.
*   **C: Lichwa lelinyenti etindzaweni letehlelako** - This translates to ""Lots of snow in steep areas"". The quantity of snow alone isn't enough; there needs to be a trigger, as mentioned.
*   **D: Lichwa lelisala lingatsintfwanga bantfu** - This translates to ""Snow left untouched by people"". The passage implies that people are a *cause* of avalanches, not something that prevents them.

Therefore, the answer is **A**."
"Ngekwalesicephu, khari usekelwe kutiphi titsako?","The correct answer is **B: Emakhambi netinongo**.

The passage states: ""Khari kudla lokuhlanganisa emakhambi netinongo, kanye nenyama noma tibhidvo."" This clearly indicates that herbs and spices are essential ingredients in curry. While other ingredients are mentioned, herbs and spices are the foundational element.
"
"Kuletinye tifundza, lubisi lwekhokhonathi ngaletinye tikhatsi lusetjentiswa esikhundleni sasiphi sitsako kukhari?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: Iyogathi**.

The passage states: ""Etifundzeni letisekhatsi nelive eNyakatfo yeNdiya nasePakistan, iyogathi ivame kusetjentiswa kukhari; ENingizimu yeNdiya nakuletinye tifundza letiselugwini lalelivekati, lubisi lwekhokhonathi livame kusetjentiswa.""

This clearly indicates that coconut milk is used *instead* of yogurt in certain regions.
"
Kungani kudzingeka kutsi ujike utungelete tintsaba tase-Transantarctic kuze ufike etsafeni?,"The passage states: ""They are not fast vehicles so they have to take a long detour around the Transantarctic Mountains before reaching the plateau.""

Therefore, the reason they go around the Transantarctic Mountains is because the vehicles are slow and can't easily traverse the mountains. This connects most directly to **C: Tigulumbha letikhetsekile atisheshi**.
"
"E-South Pole Traverse, yini lephawulwe ngemafulegi?","The correct answer is **C: Timfa letigcwele lichwa** because the passage states, ""Lichwa laso lihlanganisa kuchekeka lokugcwaliswe ngemafulegi.""
"
Yini lengashiwongo kulesicephu njengentfo tivakashi lokufanele tiyai nativakashela iNingizimu Afrikha?,"The correct answer is **C: Cishe onkhe emave lakhelene neNingizimu Afrikha atintile**

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""noma iNingizimu ye-Afrika izindzile akusiwo wonkhe emave labomakhelwane lanjalo."" This translates to ""although South Africa is large, not all neighboring countries are."" This implies that not all neighboring countries are large, directly contradicting option C which claims all neighboring countries are small.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   **A:** The passage explicitly mentions that ""Imininingwane yekutfola i-visa kanye netindleko kuyashiyana emaveni ngemave..."" which means ""Visa requirements and costs vary from country to country.""
*   **B:** The passage supports this, stating that traveling by car is a ""kahle yokubona bonkhe buhle balesifundza kanye nekufika etindzaweni letivame kuvakashelwa tivakashi,"" which translates to ""great way to see all the beauty of the region and get to less-visited places"".
*   **D:** The passage states ""i-4x4 kunconywa yona kakhulu ngoba tindzawo letinyenti kungeneka kuto ngemoto lenemasondvo lamakhulu i-4x4,"" which means ""a 4x4 is strongly recommended because many places are accessible with a 4x4.""

Therefore, option C is the only statement that is NOT supported by the text."
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengatsatfwa njengeseluleko lesibi etivakashini letifuna kuvakasha eNingizimu Afrikha ngemoti?","The correct answer is **D: Akusiwo onkhe emave lakhelene neNingizimu Afrikha lokuyintfo lenhle kuwavakashela**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: *""Kugcine engcondvweni uma utilungisela kutsi noma iNingizimu ye-Afrika izindzile akusiwo wonkhe emave labomakhelwane lanjalo.""* (Keep in mind while you prepare that even though South Africa is expensive, not all the neighboring countries are.) This implies that the expense should not deter a traveler from visiting a country, however, it can be misread that some countries might not be worth visiting. This can be seen as bad advice.

The other options are correct, or at least supported by the text:

*   **A: Tintfo letitsite tetimo letiphutfumako emotini tingase tifunwe ngumtsetfo** (Certain emergency items in the car may be required by law) - This is explicitly mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: Nanome kunconywa i-4x4, tindzawo letinyenti kuyafikeka kuto ngemoti levamile** (Even though a 4x4 is recommended, many places are accessible with a normal car) - The passage states this directly.
*   **C: Kuhamba ngemoti kuhle kakhulu kulabo labafuna kuphuma etindleleni letivamile** (Traveling by car is great for those who want to get off the beaten path) - The passage supports this by saying it's a great way to see the beauty and reach less-visited spots."
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungakashiwo kulesicephu njengengoti lengase ibe khona nawushiya tikhwama takho tingakagadvwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Tingase tiphambaniswe netalomunye umuntfu**.

The passage explicitly mentions the dangers of theft (A), unknowingly carrying drugs (B), and authorities suspecting a bomb threat (D). It doesn't mention the possibility of the bags being confused with someone else's.
"
Yini lengashiwongo kulesicephu ngekutfwala tidzakamiva?,"The correct answer is **A: Kulamanye emave, labephula umtsetfo kwekucala bgase bagwetjwe intsambo (In some countries, first-time offenders may be sentenced to death)**

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that some countries have increased penalties for first-time offenders, potentially including over 10 years of imprisonment or death. However, it does not mention a first-time offender can be sentenced to death.

Let's analyze the other options:

*   **B: Kufanele kube nekucapha lokwengetiwe nawuvakashela lamanye emave (Extra caution should be taken when visiting other countries)** - This aligns with the overall warning in the passage.
*   **C: Tinja letinukisa tidzakamiva tingase tisetjentiswe ngaphandle kwekutsi nitjelwe (Drug-sniffing dogs may be used without being told)** - This is directly stated in the passage.
*   **D: Tiphatsimandla tingase titsatse tikhwama takho, ngisho nome ungatfwalanga tidzakamiva (Authorities may confiscate your bags, even if you are not carrying drugs)** - The passage mentions that unattended bags can attract attention and lead to suspicion of bomb threats, implying authorities might seize them."
Nguyiphi inhlobo yesinatfo lengakashiwo njengentfo longetama kuyenta ekhaya ngesikhatsi uhleli?,"The correct answer is **C: Bhiya**.

The passage mentions juice, coffee, and tea as drinks you can make at home. Beer is mentioned as something you could find in bars or pubs, suggesting it's not something you'd typically make at home.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokufanele ukuvakashela nangabe lidolobha lakho latiwa ngelisiko lalo lekunatsa?,"The best answer is **C: Titolo tetjwala longavamisile kuya kuto**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically suggests exploring ""emabhareni noma etinkantini etindzaweni letidvute longakavami kuya kito kakhulu"" if your city is known for its drinking culture. This directly translates to exploring bars or pubs you don't usually visit.
*   Other options:
    *   A is partly correct as this is mentioned in the beginning, but C is a better answer because it refers to exploring places that are novel to you.
    *   B & D are related to juices/smoothies and tea, which are mentioned in the beginning as alternatives to coffee. However, exploring bars is more pertinent to a city known for its drinking culture.

Therefore, C is the most direct and relevant answer based on the provided text."
Itfolakala kuphi imifanekiso yematuba lebatiwe?,"The correct answer is **B: Ebaleni elisontfo**.

The passage states that the beautiful marble tombstones are located in the churchyard (ebaleni lisontfo).
"
Nguluphi luhlobo lwe-visa lolungase ludzinge kutsi umuntfu aletse bufakazi bekuba nemali leyenele yekumsekela?,"Impendvulo lekungiyo ngu **D: I-visa yekufundza**.

Umbhalo ucacisa kutsi emaveni lamanyenti, nawufuna i-visa yekufundza, utawudzinga kukhombisa bufakazi bekutsi unayo imali yekutisekela kulomnyaka wekucala wetifundvo takho.
"
Ngubani lokunematfuba lamanyenti ekutsi adzinge i-visa lenesikhatsi leseluliwe?,"Impendvulo lecondzile ngu: **C: Umfundzi lovela kulelinye live**

Lemphasi itsi ngisho noma ungayidzingi ivisa nayovakasha sikhatsi lesincane noma uyokwenta ibhizinisi, kuya kuma-mave uyofundza kuwo ngalokuvamile kutawudzinga kutsi uhlale sikhashana kunekuya khona njengesivakashi. Lena indlela lekukhombisa ngayo kutsi umfundzi lovela kulelinye live unematfuba lamanyenti ekutsi adzinge i-visa lenesikhatsi leseluliwe.
"
Kunini lapho kufanele ube nendzaba khona netimbuzulwane?,"Let's analyze each option against the given statement (P):

*   **A: Ngetinyanga tasehlobo (During summer months)** - The statement does mention ""ehlobo"" (summer) as a typical time to be concerned.
*   **B: Nawuhayikha (When you hike)** - The statement says ""...nangabe uncuma kucanca intsaba uhamba ngasemahlatsini emvula"" which translates to ""if you decide to climb a mountain going near the rainforest"". This implies hiking.
*   **C: Etindzaweni temahlatsi lanemvula (In rainforest areas)** - The statement specifically mentions rainforests.
*   **D: Nawusashayela (When you drive)** - The statement says that even a few minutes with an open door while driving through the rainforest can allow mosquitoes to enter.

While summer is mentioned, the main focus of the statement is on the *location* (rainforests) and the *activity* (hiking/driving in or near rainforests). Therefore, options B, C and D are correct. However, since we can only choose one answer, the best answer is C: **Etindzaweni temahlatsi lanemvula (In rainforest areas)** because the entire statement is centered around rainforests, and the other conditions are specific to that location.

So, the best answer is **C**.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lokufanele ungayenti kuze ugweme timbuzulwane nawushayela etindzaweni temahlatsi lanemvula?","The correct answer is **A: Kushiya tivalo temoti tivulekile sikhatsi lesidze**.

The passage explicitly states that even a few minutes of leaving the car door open in a rainforest is enough for mosquitoes to get inside.  Therefore, avoiding leaving the doors open for extended periods is the action you should take to avoid mosquitoes.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langesilo liciniso mayelana ne-Sundarbans?","The correct answer is **D: Ilikhaya letinyamatane letinemabalabala kwendlula ema-Bengal tiger**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Inalamanye emahlatsi lamakhulu lambalwa lasekasele** - The passage states the Sundarbans ""includes some of the last remaining mangrove forests"". This implies there are a few others, so this statement is true.
*   **B: Incenye yendzawo yayo igcwele emachaphoti** - The passage states that ""a quarter of that area is covered with water/swamps,"" so this is true.
*   **C: Yindzawo lenkhulu emhlabeni yemahlatsi e-mangrove** - The passage states ""the world's largest coastal mangrove forest.""
*   **D: Ilikhaya letinyamatane letinemabalabala kwendlula ema-Bengal tiger** - The passage says there are approximately 400 tigers and 30,000 deer. The passage does not support the claim that it is home to more deer than Bengal tigers.

Therefore, option D is not true according to the passage."
Nguyiphi incenye yelihlatsi lesekhatsi kwendzawo yaseNdiya?,"The correct answer is **A: I-Sundarbans National Park**.

The passage states: ""Incenye yelihlatsi lelisemhlabeni waseNdiya ibitwa ngekutsi yiPaki Yesive yaseSundarbans."" This directly answers the question.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngubani lokunematfuba lamakhulu ekutsi alucondze lokungenani kancane lulwimi lwesiNgisi?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Bantfu labancane ngeminyaka**.

The passage states that in some countries, you can expect incomplete knowledge of English, *especially* among younger people. This implies that younger people are more likely to have at least some knowledge of English compared to older generations in those countries. The other options are not directly supported by the text.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lokungaba matima kuyibita?","The correct answer is **B: Emakheli**

The passage specifically states: ""Emavi labhaliwe ngalokuvamile kulula kuwacondza kunemavi lashiwo ngemlomo. Liciniso laloku siyalibona emakhelini, ngalokuvamile lokulukhuni kuphimisela kahle emagama awo."" This directly indicates that addresses are often difficult to pronounce correctly.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngusiphi simo lesingalungela sivakashi lesihlela kutsatsa ibhasi lesuka esiteshini lesisekhatsi nesifundza?","The best situation for a traveler based on the text is:

*   **D: Lesivakashi siya ngasemphumalanga futsi sifika esiteshingi angakashayi 6:20**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that buses going east and to Jakar/Bumthang depart around 06:30 and 07:30. Arriving at the station before 6:20 AM gives the traveler plenty of time to catch the bus that goes east.

Let's examine why the other options aren't as good:

*   **A: Lesivakashi siya e-Jakar futsi sesivele silitsengile lithikithi** - While this is good (having a ticket is recommended), the text doesn't explicitly say this is the *best* situation. The question is asking for a situation where the text best supports the idea that it's a good situation.
*   **B: Lesivakashi siya e-Bumthang futsi kufanele sisuke nga-7** - This traveler is late. It is likely their bus has already left.
*   **C: Lesivakashi siya e-Paro futsi kufanele sisuke nga-11** - The text mentions taxis as a good option for Paro, not buses from the main station. Thus, it's not the *best* scenario based on the given passage."
Nguliph licebiso lelihle esivakashini lesifuna kuya emphumalanga sisuka esiteshini lesisesifundzeni lesisekhatsi?,"The correct answer is **B: Tsenga lithikithi kusengaphambili**.

The passage states: ""Njengoba emabhasi lachumanisa tifundza avamise kugcwala kuyaye kube kahle kutsi lithikithi ulitsenge kusasele emalanga lingakafiki lilanga lakho lekuhamba."" This directly translates to: ""As inter-district buses are usually full, it's best to buy your ticket a few days before your travel date.""  This is a key piece of advice for someone traveling east.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungayichazi kahle i-Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ayifinyeleleki ngendiza**.

The passage states that Timbuktu *does* have an airport (""futsi linesikhungo setindiza""). The other options are all mentioned as true statements about Timbuktu.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokuliciniso nge-Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **A: Lelidolobha liyafinyeleleka ngendiza**.

The passage states ""...futsi linesikhungo setindiza"" which translates to ""...and has an airport."" This directly supports answer A.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Yinhle kakhulu kunekutsi ibe nguleliphuyile:** The passage explicitly states it is a ""lidolobha leliphuyile"" (poor city).
*   **C: Yincane imihlobiso yase-Afrikha kunakulamanye emadolobha lakhelene nayo:** The passage says it has ""umoya wesi-Arab kundlula we-Africa"" which translates to ""more of an Arab vibe than African.""
*   **D: Lelidolobha alisatikhangi tivakashi:** The passage states ""...lilenta libe lidolobha lelitsandza kuvakashelwa tivakashi"" which translates to ""...makes it a city popular with tourists."""
Ekucaleni bekuhlelwe kutsi atoba khona nini ema-Olimpiki asehlobo? ,"The correct answer is **D: Nga-July 2020**

The text states that the cancellation policies related to the coronavirus would not be extended past March 2020, which was when the Olympics were originally scheduled. Therefore, the Olympics were originally planned for a time before March 2020, closer to July 2020.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kunini lapho lifu lelimise kwefanla liba khona yinkanyamba?","The correct answer is **D: Ngemuva kwekufika emhlabatsini (After it reaches the ground)**.

The passage states: ""Kucala kungimisinga kusuka esibhakabhakeni, bese kuba """"siphepho lesinemandla"""" nakufika emhlabeni."" This translates to: ""It starts as a funnel from the sky, and then it becomes a """"strong storm"""" when it reaches the ground."" This clearly indicates that the tornado only becomes a tornado *after* it touches the ground.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungusona mbamba sici senkanyamba?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngalokuvamile ihamba netintfo letisindzako**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states ""Tenta umoya lomkhulu (ngalokuvamile lohamba 100-200 wemamayela/ngeli-awa) longaphakamisa tintfo letisindzako utiyise emoyeni, utetfwale njengoba lesiphepho sendlula.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngaso sonkhe sikhatsi iba nemoya lokumamayela langaba ngu-100-200 ngeli-awa** - **P** says this happens *ngalokuvamile*, not *ngaso sonkhe sikhatsi.*
*   **C: Iba ngemafu lamise kwefanela ngemuva kwekufika emhlabatsini** - **P** doesnt mention anything about this.
*   **D: Ngemakholumu lajikeletako lafushela umoya ngaphandle** - **P** says this happens when it first starts, but doesnt explain *ngaphandle.*

"
"Ngekwalesicephu, sivakashi kufanele sisitfole kutsi seluleko mayelana nesimo setepolitiki edolobheni lesiya kulo?","The correct answer is **D: Kuhulumende wakubo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that travel advisories are tailored to citizens of the country issuing the advisory.
*   It also states that travel advisories are simply a summary and may not be comprehensive.
*   Therefore, a traveler should also seek guidance from their home country's government to get advice tailored to their citizenship and potential risks they may face."
"Nakuneteluleko tetekuhamba, yini umuntfu wekuhamba lokunematfuba lamancane ekutsi ayitfole?","The correct answer is **D: Kwatiswa lokunemininingwane leminyenti mayelana nesimo setepolitiki talelive**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that travel advisories are a ""summary of the political situation in a country"" and that the opinions given are ""often insufficient, general and simplistic compared to more extensive information available elsewhere."" This directly implies a lack of detailed information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umshuwalensi lomisiwe:** The passage mentions that travel advisories *can* affect trip cancellation insurance, so it's a potential outcome.
*   **B: Tingcikitsi letentiwe taba melula mayelana nesimo setepolitiki talelive:** This is the passage explicitly states that travel advisories do.
*   **C: Kutsintseka kwemshuwalensi wemphilo:** The passage mentions that travel advisories *can* affect health insurance."
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguluphi luhlobo lweluhamba lokunematfuba lamancane ekutsi ludzinge kutsi utfole lusito lwekubhuka enkapanini yekuhamba?","The correct answer is **A: Luhambo loluya engcungcutseleni yemsebenti edolobheni sivakashi lesike saya kulo**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** Tourist assistance is usually ideal to choose on a trip that exceeds a traveler's knowledge of the environment, culture, language, or a country with lower currency.

*   Option A is a trip to a conference in a city the traveler has been to before. This implies the traveler already has knowledge of the environment, and likely the culture and language of the city.
*   Option B is a two-week vacation on a limited budget. This vacation might need the traveler to get assistance because of the limited budget.
*   Option C mentions language barrier problems, which the text mentions as a time when tourist assistance would be good to have.
*   Option D is a first-time trip to a foreign country. Tourist assistance would be good to have, because the traveler would likely not have a good understanding of the environment, culture, language, and currency."
"Ngekwalesicephu, kukusiphi simo lapho khona sivakashi sitawuzuza khona kakhulu elusitweni lwenkapani yetekuhamba?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: Lapho lesivakashi sivakashela indzawo lakunemasiko lehlukile lesiwetayele**.

The passage states: ""Insitakuvakasha imvamiso ikahle kuyikhetsa eluvakashweni lelendlula lwati lwesivakashi mayelana nemvelo, emasiko, lulwimi noma live lelinemali lephansi."" This directly supports the idea that travel agencies are most helpful when the traveler lacks knowledge about the culture of the place they are visiting.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengase isite sivakashi sigweme kudvumateka nasivakashele tindzawo letinsha?","The correct answer is **B: Kukulungela kwetama kudla lesingakakwetayeli**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the differences between the traveler's home and the new place they are visiting.** It highlights that things like behavior, laws, food, traffic, standards, and language will likely be different.

* **The goal is to avoid disappointment or dislike.** The passage suggests keeping these differences in mind.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kulindzela lizinga lelifanako nalapho sisuka khona** (Expecting the same standards as where you come from): This is the opposite of what the passage advises. Expecting things to be the same will likely lead to disappointment.
*   **C: Kulandzela imitsetfo lefanako neyalapho sisuka khona** (Following the same laws as where you come from): This is dangerous and incorrect. Travelers must follow the laws of the place they are visiting.
*   **D: Kugwema kwenta lucwaningo ngetindzawo tekulala** (Avoiding doing research on places to sleep): This is not mentioned in the passage, and it's generally a bad idea to avoid doing research when traveling.

**B: Kukulungela kwetama kudla lesingakakwetayeli** (Being prepared to try food that you are not used to) directly addresses one of the examples of potential differences (food) mentioned in the passage. Being open to trying new things (like food) is a way to avoid disappointment and embrace the new culture.
"
"Ngalokusekelwe ekwatisweni lokukulesicephu, luhlobo lolunjani lwemuntfu lolungase ludvumateke naluvakashela endzaweni yangaphandle?","The passage emphasizes that things will be different than ""back home"" and that you should keep this in mind to avoid disappointment. This suggests that someone **inflexible and unwilling to accept differences** would be more likely to be disappointed.

Therefore, the best answer is **C: Umuntfu lonemcondvo lovalekile (A person with a closed mind)**.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Umuntfu lotsandza kudla lokungakajwayeleki (A person who likes unusual food):** This person would likely *enjoy* the differences in food.
*   **B: Umuntfu lojabulela lushintjo (A person who enjoys change):** This person would likely *thrive* in a new environment.
*   **D: Umuntfu lotsandza kufundza (A person who likes to learn):** This person would be *intrigued* by the differences."
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungasiso seluleko lesinconywako kubantfu labavakashela live lelisatfutfuka kwekucala?,"The correct answer is **A: Yati tilwane tasendzaweni ngembi kwekutsi ulale phansi**.

Here's why:

*   **B: Gwema kudla kakhulu ngemalanga akho ekucala:** The text advises using Western-style restaurants and hotels at first to ease the transition, which implies being careful with local food.
*   **C: Kunconywa umbhedze nome ihamokhi nangabe ukhempe ngaphandle:** The text explicitly recommends bringing a cot or hammock to avoid snakes and other creatures when camping.
*   **D: Tfola lihhotela lelisezingeni lelisetulu nawufika kwekucala:** The text suggests using Western-style hotels to adjust.
*   **A: Yati tilwane tasendzaweni ngembi kwekutsi ulale phansi:** The text only says you should not lie down on a sponge or pad where you are unfamiliar with local animals. It does not make the advice to ""Know the local animals before sleeping on the ground.""

Therefore, option A is not explicitly recommended."
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungakabalwa njengentfo longayijabulela nawusetayelana nelive lelisatfutfuka?,"The correct answer is **C: Matalasi nome sipontji sekukhempa**.

The passage advises against sleeping on mattresses or sponges in unfamiliar places because of potential encounters with animals. It suggests using Western-style amenities, high-end hotels and services, and even Western food to ease the transition, and that sleeping in tents requires an outdoor bed or hammock.
"
"Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungaba ncono kumuntfu lonepholisi lofuna ikhophi lekutebucwepheshe yepholisi yakhe, kodvwa longakhoni kungena ku-inthanethi?","The best answer is **A: Kuniketa umuntfu lahamba naye ikhophi**

Here's why:

*   **The question specifies the person *cannot* access the internet.** This eliminates options B, C, and D because email, a laptop and cloud storage require internet access.
* Giving a copy to a traveling companion provides the easiest way to access the information in a *non-technical* way.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungadzingeki kukhonjiswe kupholisi?","The answer is **D: Likheli le-imeyili lemnikati wepholisi**.

The passage specifically mentions needing to show:

*   ""i-e-mail address yalomuntfu wemshuwalensi"" (email address of the insurance person/company)
*   ""netinombolo telucingo takulamanye emave kuze bagunyatwe futsi bafake sicelo sekutfola lokutsite"" (international phone numbers for authorization and claims).

The passage doesn't say anything about needing to show the policyholder's email address."
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguyiphi isayizi leveta ifomathi yelifilimu lesetjentiswa kakhulu?","The correct answer is **D: I-36 x 24 mm negative**.

The passage states that 35mm (specifically 36 x 24) film is ""lavamile"" which translates to ""common"".
"
Nguyiphi kulamafomathi elifilimu lalandzelako leniketa kukhanya lokufana nekwe-DSLR?,"The correct answer is **A: Lifilimu lelingu-35 mm**.

The passage states that 35mm film is ""readily available and lightweight, and featured on recent DSLR options."" This implies that it provides a similar experience or compatibility to DSLRs.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokungaba sinyatselo sekugcina sekucala ibhizinisi yekubhala ngeteluhambo?","The correct answer is **C: Kwakha iwebusayithi yakho**.

The passage states that *after* you have practiced formatting and editing, you can *then* build your own website. This makes building your own website the final step mentioned in the passage.
"
"Nawucalisa ibhizinisi yakho yekubhala ngetekuhamba, ngumaphi kulamakhono lalandzelako lokungase kudzingeke uwatfutfukise kucala?","The correct answer is **C: Kulungisa lokubhaliwe**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes starting small by contributing to an existing travel blog.** This means focusing on writing quality content. Editing/correcting writing (Kulungisa lokubhaliwe) is essential for producing good content, even before you think about building your own website.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kubhala iwebusayithi (Writing a website)**: While web writing is important, the initial focus is on general writing skills for a travel blog.
* **B: Kulungisa lokubhalwe kuwebusayithi (Fixing what's written on a website)**: Although it's somewhat related to writing, it is not directly helpful for a complete beginner in travel writing.
* **D: Kwakha iwebusayithi (Building a website)**: The passage suggests *later* building your own website, not as an initial step.

Therefore, honing your general editing and writing skills (Kulungisa lokubhaliwe) is the most crucial first step based on the given advice.
"
Kukuluphi luhlobo lwesimo selitulu lapho tinkinga tematfumbu tivame kutfolakala khona?,"The correct answer is **C: Lapho kushisa khona**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...tinkinga tesisu tetayelekile etindzaweni letishisako futsi etikhatsini letinyenti atitsandzeki kepha atisiyo ingoti."" (stomach problems are common in hot areas and are mostly not dangerous).
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kuchayeka njalo kungabangela kuvikeleka kuphi?","The correct answer is **B: Kumagciwane endzawo**.

The passage states that ""Ekhaya, ngenca yekuchayeka njalo emagciwaneni asendzaweni, manengi ematfuba ekutsi ugcine umtimba wakho sewukhona kulwa nawo"" which translates to ""At home, because of constant exposure to local germs, you are more likely to develop immunity to them.""
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokubuhle bekuvakasha endzaweni ye-Schengen?,"The passage mentions all of the options as benefits of traveling in the Schengen area, except for one. Let's break it down:

*   **A: Kugwema ticelo letinyenti tema-visa:** The passage explicitly states ""...nangabe une-visa yaseSchengen, awudzingi faka ticelo tema-visa eveni ngalinye lelililunga leSchengen... ngako loko konga sikhatsi, imali nemsebenti wekugcwalisa emaphepha.""
*   **B: Konga imali:** The passage says the Schengen visa saves ""sikhatsi, imali nemsebenti wekugcwalisa emaphepha,"" which confirms saving money.
*   **C: Kugwema tindzawo letinyenti tekuhlolwa kwemapasipoti:** The passage states ""...ungakhona kuwela lithaka ngaphandle kwekutsi uye lapho bahlola khona ipasipoti.""
*   **D: Ayifuneki ipasipoti:** The passage says that when traveling between countries in the Schengen area, you ""ungakhona kuwela lithaka ngaphandle kwekutsi uye lapho bahlola khona ipasipoti."" This implies you still need your passport, but you may not need to show it every time you cross a border.

Therefore, the best answer that encompasses the benefits is **A, B, and C**. However, if I have to choose one correct answer from the list, it would be **A: Kugwema ticelo letinyenti tema-visa**, since it's the most directly emphasized benefit related to the Schengen agreement.

Therefore, the answer is **A, B, and C** or **A** depending on if you can choose multiple answers.
"
Yini lengeke isatfolakala ethuneni la-Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **D: Umcebo**.

The passage states ""Lemicebo lemangalisako yalelithuna ayisekho kilo, kepha yasuswa yamikiswa eMsamo weGibhithe eCairo."" This clearly indicates that the treasures are no longer in the tomb. The passage also states that only the head and shoulders of the mummy are visible, so B and C are incorrect. A is incorrect because the passage states the tomb is decorated, but that it is not extravagantly decorated.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguyiphi indzawo yaseVancouver lengakhanga kancane bantfu labakhatsateke kakhulu ngemali? ","The answer is **C: I-Bowen Island**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes Bowen Island as being easily accessible by ferry from Granville Island in Vancouver, offering kayaking, hiking, food tours, and more.
*   The passage then says that Whistler is an expensive option.
*   Granville Island is simply a place to catch the ferry.
*   Sea to Sky is just a general area, not a specific location.

The passage doesn't directly say Bowen Island is *less* expensive, but it *implies* it is a good option as an alternative to the more expensive Whistler, specifically highlighting the variety of outdoor activities it offers."
"Ngekwalesicephu, nguyiphi indzawo lokunematfuba lamakhulu ekutsi yente tivakashi tijabulele i-Vancouver?","Based on the passage, the answer is **A: Bowen Island**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly describes Bowen Island as a popular day trip or weekend getaway, offering kayaking, hiking, dining, and more.
*   While Whistler is mentioned, it's presented as a more expensive option and primarily known for winter sports (skiing) and summer mountain biking.
*   Vancouver and Granville Island are mentioned, but more in the context of transportation to Bowen Island. The passage does not explicitly state that either of those locations are the best places to visit to enjoy Vancouver.
Therefore, the passage suggests Bowen Island has a wider range of readily accessible activities that are desirable for visitors."
"Ngekwalesicephu, kunini lapho khona tivakashi kufanele tivakashele Timphophoma natifuna kubuka kahle ngaphandle kwekusitseka?","The correct answer is **D: Nakungasiso sikhatsi setimvula**

Here's why:

The passage states that during the rainy season (November to March), the water levels rise significantly, and while the falls are powerful, the mist and spray can obscure the view and the sound is overwhelming. Therefore, the best time to visit for clear viewing is outside the rainy season.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, buyini buhle bekuvakashela i-Victoria Fall emkhatsini wa-November na-March?","The correct answer is **C: Kumangalisa kwemphophoma**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ngesikhatsi setimvula (ngaNovember kuya kuMarch), lizinga lemanti litawukhula kakhulu neTimphophoma titawuba nemanti lamanyenti."" This directly translates to ""During the rainy season (November to March), the water level will increase greatly and the Falls will have more water."" This indicates the splendor or magnificence of the falls (kumangalisa kwemphophoma) is heightened during this time.
* The passage further adds the downside of visiting at that time: ""Utawuba manti nakanjani nawewela kulelibhuloho noma nawuhamba endleleni leseceleni kwaleMphophoma. Ngalolunye luhlangotsi, kuyahambisana ngoba umsindvo wemanti mkhulu kakhulu kangangekutsi uvimba kubonakala kwaletimpophoma-ngiwo onkhe lamanti!"" This explains you will get wet and the downside that the sound is so intense that the view is compromised.
* The remaining options are incorrect:

    *   A: The text doesn't mention ease of viewing. In fact, it suggests the opposite due to the amount of water.
    *   B: The passage doesn't mention anything about fewer tourists during this period.
    *   D: The rainy season is specifically during November to March, so you would NOT be avoiding the rainy season."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokunganconywa nawusebentisa idroni nawushutha lifilimu?","The correct answer is **A: Kuhlola kusengaphambili loko lovumeleke kukushutha (Checking in advance what you are allowed to shoot)**

The passage explicitly states: ""Nawusebentisa ikhamera leyindiza lekutsiwa yidrone hlola kusengaphambili kutsi yini longakhona kuyitfwebula nalovumeleke kuyitfwebula noma kutsi kukhona yini letinye timvume lotidzingako."" (When using a drone camera, check in advance what you can and are allowed to shoot or if there are any other permits you need.)

The other options are either directly supported by the passage or directly contradicted:

*   **B: Kutfola timvume letengetiwe (Obtaining additional permits)** is mentioned as something you may need to do after checking what you are allowed to shoot.
*   **C: Kwenta lucwaningo mayelana netimvume (Doing research about permits)** is part of checking in advance what you are allowed to shoot.
*   **D: Kushutha kuphela etindzaweni letigcwele bantfu lapho idroni ingeke inakeke khona (Shooting only in crowded places where the drone will not be noticed)** is directly contradicted by the statement: ""Kundizisa lokwetindiza lokuncane kwekudlala eceleni kwesikhumulo setindiza noma lapho kunesicuku sebantfu khona akusiwo umcondvo lomuhle, ngisho nasetindzaweni lapho kuvumeleke khona kukwenta loko."" (Flying a small drone near an airport or where there is a crowd of people is not a good idea, even in places where you are allowed to do so.)"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngutiphi tindzawo letincono kutsi ungashutha ngedroni?","The correct answer is **D: Etindzaweni lapho utfole khona timvume kusengaphambili** (In places where you have obtained permission in advance).

The passage emphasizes checking permissions before flying a drone and implies that obtaining permission is essential. The other options are explicitly discouraged or nonsensical based on the text.
"
"Ngalokusekelwe kulesicephu, ngumaphi emavi langasilo liciniso mayelana nekutimfuneko tekubhalisela i-visa?","The correct answer is **B: Onkhe emave adzinga kutsi ubhalise netiphatsimandla tendzawo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that registration is ""required in some countries,"" not all.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   A: The passage says: ""In some cases, only those not staying in tourist accommodations need to register.""
*   C: The passage says: ""This may require filling out a form with the local police or seeking assistance at immigration offices.""
*   D: The passage says: ""In many countries with a law like this, local hotels will do the registration (be sure to ask)."""
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungasiyo indzawo lapho tivakashi tingase tiye khona kuze tiyobhalisa?,"The correct answer is **C: Ehhovisi leliposli endzaweni** (Local post office).

The passage mentions registration taking place at:

*   Local police station
*   Hotels
*   Immigration offices

It does not mention post offices."
Ngubani longeke azuze ngekuvolontiya nakaseluhambeni?,"The correct answer is **B: Umuntfu lofuna liholo lelikhulu**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage emphasizes that volunteering often provides accommodation and food, and sometimes a small stipend, rather than a significant salary.** Someone looking for a high salary would not benefit from a volunteering experience.
*   The other options (A, C, and D) align with the benefits of volunteering mentioned in the passage. Volunteering helps people make friends, develop new skills, and potentially benefit from housing and food assistance.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, kuvolontiya nawukulamanye emave kumzuzisa kanjani umuntfu lonemali lekaliwe?","The correct answer is **C: Kudla nendzawo yekuhlala ngaletinye tikhatsi uyanikwa.**

The passage explicitly states: ""leminyenti imisebenti yekuba livolontiya utfola indlu yekuhlala nekudla futsi labambalwa babhadala imali lencane."" This means many volunteer jobs provide housing and food, and some even pay a small stipend, directly addressing how volunteering abroad can benefit someone on a budget. The other options are not directly stated as benefits for someone on a limited budget.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengase itsatfwe njengaleyetayelekile eluhambeni loluvamile loluya e-Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **C: Kucitsa sonkhe sikhatsi kuloluhambo usendzaweni ye-Disney**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that a typical ""Disney World trip"" involves ""spending nearly a week without leaving Disney property.""
"
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langasilo liciniso mayelana ne-Walt Disney World?,"The correct answer is **A: Emathikithi e-park-hopper ayendluliseleka kuletinye tivakashi**.

The passage explicitly states that Disney tickets are non-transferable. Therefore, any statement suggesting they *are* transferable is false.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuletinkinga letilandzelako lokunematfuba lamanyenti ekutsi kungentiwa eklasini lekucecesha lelicwepheshile nome kulokushicilelwe?","Based on the text, the correct answer is **C: Kulungela indzawo lenemphi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, while those about war zones are less so. This implies that war zone preparedness is a more specialized and less readily available topic.
*   The passage describes that survival in war zones is part of the training courses (i.e., role play, first aid, and weapons). This specialized training makes it less accessible and more complex than the other options.
*   The passage also mentions that looking for ""hostile environment training"" will lead you to companies in your local area, indicating that this is a specific type of training that exists.

Therefore, preparing for a war zone is the most likely topic to be found in a professional training class or specialized publication, rather than being widely available in general survival resources."
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngutiphi kuletihloko letilandzelako lokunematfuba lamancane ekutsi tentiwe eklasini lekucecesha lokucwepheshile?","Based on the excerpt, the correct answer is **C: Kusindza ehlane**.

Here's why:

*   The excerpt mentions that survival skills are common in books and magazines, but specific books about warzones are rare. Therefore, the training is focused on warzone survival.
*   The excerpt explicitly mentions ""lusito lwekucala"" and ""indzima ledlalwako"" as part of the training.
*   The excerpt alludes to difficult situations when it mentioned ""timo letimatima.""

"Ngekwalesicephu, ngumuphi umbono loncono wekugwema emanti lokungenteka angcolile?","The best answer based on the text provided is **B: Tsenga emanti lasemabhodleleni.**

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""nangabe kukukhatsata loko, ngako kuyodzingeka ukucabangele kutsenga emanti lasebhodleleni lelivaliwe enkapaneni leyetsenjwako."" (If you are concerned about that, you may need to consider buying bottled water from a trusted company.)

While boiling (A and C) are mentioned, the effectiveness varies by location. The passage suggests bottled water from a reputable company as a reliable option when concerned about water contamination. Option D is not mentioned in the passage at all."
"Ngekwalesicephu, yini lengase ingenteki ngisho nakubabhukushi labanelikhono?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Kubhukusha uphambane nemsinga wemanti**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that trying to swim back against the rip current (umsinga wemanti) is likely impossible due to exhaustion."
Yini lokufanele uyente nawubanjwa ngumsinga?,"Let's analyze the provided text (P) to determine the best course of action when caught in a rip current:

*   **""Emagagasi labuyela emuva elwandle esuka elusetseni, ngalokuvamile ahamba nesihlabatsi.""** - This describes a rip current.
*   **""Ngekushesha nje nawuphuma kulesigaba lokuso, kubhukusha ubuyele emuva kumantima kakhulu kunekubhukuda lokuvamile.""** - This implies that swimming directly against the current to get back to shore is difficult, if not impossible.
*   **""Zama kufinyelela lapho bangeke bakubambe khona futsi noma, kushiyane ngemakhono akho kutsi sebakubonile yini, mhlawumbe ungafuna kumela kusindziswa.""** - This suggests swimming out of the current and waiting for rescue if needed.

Based on this information, the best approach is to swim out of the current rather than directly against it.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **A: Yetama kuphuma kuwo ngekuya kulolunye luhlangotsi, bese ubhukusha uya elusentseni** (Try to get out of it by going to one side, then swim towards the shore)

"Ngekwalesicephu, kukuyiphi indzawo lapho kuvakashela ikhaseli kungase kube yintfo lemnandzi kuyenta nawuseholidini?","The correct answer is **C: E-Rhine Valley**

The passage specifically mentions ""sigodlo saseSigodzini iLoire, sigodzi iRhine"" as examples of inland waterways that would be good vacation spots.
"
"Ngekwalesicephu, ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungeke kunconywe kulabasikati labavakashele lendzawo?","The answer is **A: Gwema kucoca ngesimo sekulwa**.

The passage doesn't mention anything about avoiding discussion of politics. It focuses on:

*   **C: Gwema kugcoka bucwebe lobukhatitelako:** The passage advises wearing a ring that doesn't appear too expensive.
*   **B: Caphela kutsi kuhluka kwemasiko kungase kubangele bantfu bendzawo kutsi balwe:** The passage explicitly mentions being aware of cultural differences and potential misinterpretations.
*   **D: Cina nangabe kudzingekile:** The passage emphasizes the importance of being firm when refusing unwanted advances.

Therefore, option A is the only one not supported by the text.
"
"Ngalokusekelwe endzaweni lechazwe kulesicephu, yini lengase inconyelwe kulabasikati labavakashako?","The best answer is **D: Endzabeni yekufunwa, cina ekwaleni emadvodza**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states ""Kufanele ucine nangabe wala indvodza, ungasabi kwala"". This translates to ""You must be firm when rejecting a man, do not be afraid to reject (cultural differences or not, it does not make it permissible!)"". This is a direct piece of advice for women traveling in this region.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Bona kutsi akukavami kulandzelwa:** While the passage mentions being followed, the recommendation is NOT to assume it's just normal. Instead, it's warning to be cautious, which makes this answer incorrect.
*   **B: Gwema kugcoka indandatho lenkhulu kukhombisa simo sekulwa:** The passage advises wearing a ring to *appear* married for safety, not to signal a fighting stance. The advice is to *not* wear an expensive-looking ring, but the purpose is to deter unwanted attention, not to show readiness for conflict.
*   **C: Condza kutsi kwehluka kwemasiko kusho kumelela indzawo yakho:** The passage warns against blindly accepting cultural differences if they lead to harassment. It stresses standing your ground, not representing your location."
"Ngalokusekelwe kulesicephu, ngusiphi simo lesidzinga umtsebuli wetitfombe kutsi asebentise ilensi lekhetsekile?","The correct answer is **A: Nawufuna kushutha tilwanyana letincane**.

The passage states: ""Nawushutha tilwane tasendle ngalokuvamile udzinga ilensi lendze, nakuba tintfo letinjengemhlambi wetinyoni noma tilokatana letincane tidzinga lamanye emalensi."" This means small animals require different lenses than the long lenses usually used for wildlife photography.
"
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungakashiwo kulesicephu njengenkinga lengahle ibe kona kubatsebuli betitfombe?,"The correct answer is **C: Kutfola luhlobo lwemalensi ladzingekako**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Kutfola tilwane letitsite letingakavami (Finding certain rare animals)** is mentioned in the passage: ""Tilwane letininngi letinhle kundzima kutitfola..."" (Many beautiful animals are difficult to find).

*   **B: Kubhekana netilwane letinelulaka (Dealing with aggressive animals)** is mentioned: ""Tilwane tesiganga tingaba nemahkoni nobe tibe nelulaka."" (Wild animals can be territorial or aggressive).

*   **D: Kusebenta etindzaweni letingase tibe nebungoti (Working in potentially dangerous environments)** is mentioned: ""Kantsi indzawo letihlala kuyo kungenteka ibandze kakhulu, ishise noma ibe kabi ekuphileni kwalesilwane ngandlelatsite."" (And the environment they live in might be very cold, hot or in some way be unbearable to the animal).

*   **C: Kutfola luhlobo lwemalensi ladzingekako (Finding the type of lens needed)** is not mentioned as a *problem*. The passage *does* discuss lenses, but it focuses on needing different lenses for different subjects (long lenses for most wildlife, other lenses for flocks of birds or small animals) and doesn't imply that *finding* the lenses is a challenge. Rather, it discusses what lenses are required for particular situations."
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungase kubangele tinkinga letincane kumshayeli lohamba etindzaweni tetintsaba?,"The correct answer is **D: Kungaboni kahle (Poor visibility)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions several causes of poor visibility when driving in mountainous areas during winter conditions: snowfall, blowing snow, and condensation on windows.
*   While the passage mentions reduced traction (""kuncubutana kuphasi"") and collisions (""lokungcubutana""), those are *consequences* of the weather conditions, not necessarily the *cause* of *minor* problems.
*   Siminyaminya setimoti (Traffic jams) are not mentioned in the paragraph.
*   Kushintja kwegesi ibe ngemanti (Gas turning into water) is not mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, *kungaboni kahle* is the most direct and likely source of immediate, minor problems for a driver in those conditions."
Yini lengase ihlale ingashintji mayelana nemtselo longena emaveni lehlukehlukene?,"Let's analyze the paragraph to determine what *generally* stays consistent across different countries regarding taxes.

*   **A: Emanani (Amounts):** The paragraph explicitly states that tax *amounts* vary from country to country. So, this is incorrect.
*   **B: Kwakheka (Structure/Calculation):** The paragraph says tax is *calculated* in different ways in different countries. So, this is incorrect.
*   **C: Lapho ufaka khona (Where you file):** The paragraph mentions that if your company represents its country's living, it usually means you have to register taxes for the country you're in. This implies that the location where you need to file is not consistent. So this is incorrect.
*   **D: Emazinga (Rates):** The paragraph explicitly mentions that tax *rates* vary from country to country. So this is incorrect.

The original paragraph implies that if a company represent its country's living, it will need to register taxes for that country. Hence, no answer is correct."
"Ngekwalesicephu, nawusebenta kulamanye emave kodvwa uhlala kulenye indzawo, kukuphi lapho kungenteka ufaka khona umtselo wakho wemali lenganako?","Based on the excerpt provided, the most accurate answer is **C: Eveni lapho usebentela khona.**

The excerpt states that generally, working in a foreign country means you need to register for taxes in *that* country. While it also mentions complexities like regional taxes and variations between countries, the core principle is taxation where the work is performed.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Lapho uhlala khona sikhatsi lesinyenti:** While your residency can affect your global tax obligations, the excerpt specifically discusses the *requirement* to register for taxes in the country where you are working.
*   **B: E-United States:** The excerpt uses the US as an example of regional taxation but doesn't imply that all international workers should file taxes there.
*   **D: Nome ngukuphi lapho imali iphansi khona:** This is tax avoidance and is generally illegal. The excerpt discusses legal tax obligations."
Ngumaphi kulamavi lalandzelako langayichazi kahle i-World Fair?,"The correct answer is **D: Emave akudzingeki abe yincenye.**

Here's why:

*   **A: Imibukiso ingase ibonise umlandvo nome emasiko elive:** This is explicitly stated in the text.
*   **B: Imibukiso yetitjalo ikhonjiswa edvute nemibukiso yemasiko neyekufundzisa:** The text suggests that there are specifically two different types of Expositions, one focusing on art and science and one focusing on horticultural things.
*   **C: Imicimbi ingafinyelela etinyangeni letingafika kuletisitfupha:** This is also stated in the text ""Lemibutsano ngalokuvamile itsatsa kusukela etinyangeni letintsatfu kuya kuletisitfupha.""
*   **D: Emave akudzingeki abe yincenye:** The text clearly states that ""Emave latsatsa incenye abonakalisa buciko kanye nemfundvo..."". This implies that the participation of countries is a key element of these events.

Therefore, only option D is incorrect according to the provided text."
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungumtsetfo we-World’s Fair nome i-International Exposition?,"The correct answer is **A: Imibukiso kufanele ikhombise kokubili emasiko elive netinkinga temhlaba.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Emave latsatsa incenye abonakalisa buciko kanye nemfundvo etindzaweni temphakatsi tesive kubonisa inkinga yemhlaba wonkhe nobe lisiko nemlandvo welive labo."" This translates to ""Participating countries display art and education in public areas of the nation to display a global problem or the culture and history of their country."" This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Live lelifanako ngeke libambe lemicimbi minyaka yonkhe** While the passage implies the events are supposed to be held in different countries each time, it doesn't explicitly state that the *same* country cannot host the event every year.
*   **C: Lemicimbi kufanele itsatse sikhatsi lesifika etinyangeni letisitfupha** The passage says that the expositions usually last *from* three to six months, not necessarily *up to* six months.
*   **D: Kuze lombukiso ubanjwe, onkhe emave kufanele ahlanganyele** The passage says ""Emave latsatsa incenye"" which means ""Participating countries."" So not *all* countries need to participate."
Kwenta kuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungehlusa ematfuba ekuhlaselwa silwane?,"The correct answer is **B: Kususa idoti endzaweni yekukhempa.**

Here's why:

*   **The passage emphasizes avoiding attracting animals with smells.** Leaving trash around will definitely attract animals.
*   **Option A** says to handle scented lotions, this would increase the chances of attracting animals.
*   **Option C** is incorrect. The passage says to keep a distance of 100 meters from bears and moose. A yard is smaller than a meter, so 25 yards will definitely get you way too close.
*   **Option D** indicates that one should feed the animals left over food, which is definitely not what the passage suggests. It says to ""avoid handling or cooking strong smelling food""."
Ngukuphi kuloku lokulandzelako lokungakashiwo kulesicephu njengalokungase kube yimbangela yekuhlaselwa silwane?,"The correct answer is **D: Tilwane letingakabetayeli bantfu**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Liphunga lelinemandla:** The passage explicitly states that strong smells attract bears and other wild animals.
*   **B: Kwehluleka kugcina libanga:** The passage emphasizes the importance of maintaining a safe distance from animals (100 meters for bears and moose, 25 meters for others) and that people are injured annually for not doing so.
*   **C: Kunika tilwane tasendle kudla:** The passage advises against feeding or disturbing wild animals.
*   **D: Tilwane letingakabetayeli bantfu:** The passage mentions that animals in areas where animals see people are used to them, but does not say it causes animal attacks.
Therefore, not being used to people isn't mentioned as a cause of attack."
