"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ekoki te kondimama lokola sekele pona kobeta accordeon malamu?","The correct answer is **A: Pona komatisa volime , matisa makasi oyo ozali kofina na yango bilembo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""...ntina na ntina te ya kobeta bilembo makasi mingi mpo makelele eza mingi neti na piano."" This means pressing the keys harder does *not* increase volume on an accordion like it might on a piano. The passage goes on to state that to increase volume, you must work with the bellows (soufflet).

The other options are things that, according to the text, can help you play the accordion better:

*   **B: Tika koningisa misapi nayopambapamba pona kobatela bopikiliki nayo (Stop wiggling your fingers unnecessarily to conserve your energy)** - This is a direct suggestion from the passage: ""...lisusu komeka te na koningisa misapi na yo na makasi. Na ndenge wana, ozali komilembisa yo moko mwa moke.""
*   **C: Kobosana te tango ozali kofina bilembo sala ete loboko nayo ezala pete (Remember to keep your arm relaxed when pressing the keys)** - This is also directly advised: ""Sala nyonso liboko na yo ezala malamu soki likoki ezali ntango ozokoma biloko nyonso malamu...""
*   **D: Matisa vitesi oyo ozali kosalela soufflet pona kobakisa volime (Increase the speed you use the bellows to increase volume)** - The passage states: ""...mpona kozwa volime mosusu, okosalela eloko babengi soufflet makasi to na vitese mingi."""
"Tango ozali kobeta accordeon , nini na kati na mae malandi ekosunga komatisa volime?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

**A: Vitesi ebele**

The text states: ""Na accordéon, mpona kozwa volime mosusu, okosalela eloko babengi soufflet makasi to na vitese mingi."" (On the accordion, to get more volume, you use the bellows hard OR with a lot of speed.)

""Vitesse mingi"" translates to ""a lot of speed."" While ""makasi"" (strong) is also mentioned, it relates to the force applied to the bellows, which is less direct than the speed of the bellows.
"
Pona nini foto ya television bandelo na yango ya suka ekatemi?,"The best answer is **B: Na yango foto etondi na ecran mobimba** (So the picture fills the whole screen).

The passage explicitly states that overscan is done ""po foto emonana na ecran mobimba"" (so the picture appears on the whole screen).
"
"Kolanda maloba wana , likama nini kati na mae malandi oyo moto akoki kokutana na yango tango azali kobongola filme na lolenge ya DVD?","The correct answer is **B: Kokata maloba ya kokomama ndambu**.

The passage states: ""soki osali video oyo eza na makomi ezoleka na ecran pene ya basonge, ekomonana te mobimba."" (if you make a video with text scrolling near the edges of the screen, it won't be fully visible).  This directly implies that text can be cut off.
"
Mapinga ya Grande Bretagne ezuamaki na esika nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Trenton**.

The passage states that General Cadwalder attacked the British in Bordentown, General Ewing was at Trenton Ferry/Assunpink Creek, and the main force crossed the river north of Trenton and then attacked. The passage does not mention Princeton. Since the question asked where the British forces were *found*, Trenton is the location where the main attack occurred, making it the most likely answer.
"
Mokoloto ya nani ezuamaki na mokanda oyo ekomami na maboko?,"The correct answer is **D: Charles Thomson**.

The text states: ""nsima batindaki mokanda ya ebandeli oyo mokambi ya Congres John Hancock pe sekretere Charles Thomsonatiaki batiaki maboko...""  This translates to: ""...then the original document was sent which the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson signed..."" This clearly indicates that Charles Thomson signed the handwritten original.
"
"Na kati ya bisika mae malandi , Dunlap broadside ekomaki wapi pona mbala ya suka?","The correct answer is **C: London**.

The passage states: ""Kopi moko ekomaki na Londres na mokolo ya 10 sanza ya mwambe."" This translates to ""A copy arrived in London on the 10th of August."" While other locations are mentioned in the text, London is where a copy *arrived* last based on the timeline presented.
"
Mapinga ya Colonel Stark ezuamaki na esika nini?,"Based on the text, the correct answer is **A: Na suka ya nordi, na efelo**.

The passage states: ""Bato ya Stark bazwaki bisika pene ya lopango na suka ya nordi ya esika ya babotoli mboka."" This translates to: ""Stark's men took positions near the fence at the north end of the peninsula.""
"
"Kolanda maloba wana , na tango nini bato ya Stark bakobisaki kimolai ya efelo na bango?","The correct answer is **C: Na tango mai ezali ya kokita**.

The text says: ""ntango mai ya makasi efungoli nzela na Ebale Mystic na ndelo ya nordi este ya esanga, bakomisaki noki bandelo na bango molai na mwa efelo ya mabanga ya mokuse na nordi oyo ezosuka na mopanzi ya mai na mwa libongo ya moke."" This translates to: ""when the high tide opened the way to the Mystic River on the northeast border of the island, they quickly extended their lines along a small stone wall in the north that ended at the edge of the water at a small beach."" This clearly indicates that they extended their wall when the tide was high. Since the question asks when they extended their wall, the best answer is when the tide was high. ""Mai ya makasi"" means high tide, and therefore implies they extended the wall when the water was receding.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, eleko nini na kati ya mae malandi ezalaki ya mabe koleka na mboka Chine?","The correct answer is **D: Na eleko ya bokonzi Misato**.

The passage states that the Three Kingdoms period was one of the deadliest in Chinese history due to the widespread warfare and struggle for power. While the other periods are mentioned, they aren't explicitly described as being as devastating as the Three Kingdoms period.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana , bosolo ezali nini na mae matali libota ya bafourmis na ngonga batambolaka kokende bisika misusu?","The correct answer is **B: Bazali na kozanga bilei** (They are lacking food).

Here's why:

* The text states, ""Lisanga ebandaki kokende esika mosusu soki bilei ezalaki lisusu mingi te esika bazalaki."" This directly translates to the colony moving when there wasn't enough food where they were.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Basaka bisika ya kovanda na butu** (They make places to live at night): The text says they travel at night and *make camp* during the day to avoid traveling in the sun, not to make permanent dwellings.
*   **C: Basalaka bandako oyo ebongwanaka sima ya mikolo 17** (They make houses that change after 17 days): The text says that each journey takes approximately 17 days. It doesn't say they rebuild the houses every 17 days. The small temporary nests are rebuilt *every day* during the journey.
*   **D: Batambolaka na moi** (They travel in the sun): The text directly states they *avoid* traveling during the day.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, maloba nini esosolisi malamu bizaleli ya bituluku ya bafourmis na ngonga batambolaka kokende bisika misusu?","The correct answer is **C: Babongolaka bandako mikolo nyonso**

Here's why:

*   **The text states:** ""...lisanga ezalaki kosala bandako ya ango moke oyo bazalaki kobongola mikolo nyonso."" This directly supports option C.
Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Batongaka bandako na Butu:** The text says they make camp during the day so that they don't travel, implying they build temporary shelters during the day.
*   **B: Batamboalaka mikolo 17 na kozanga kotonga bandako:** The text says it took approximately 17 days per move and that they built and changed shelters along the way.
*   **D: Basalelaka kaka bandako wana pona ngonga nyonso ya kotambola:** The text states that they change shelters every day."
Nini na kati ya mae malandi ekokoba atasoki ba molongo ezali?,"The correct answer is **A: Bileko endogene**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...bahorloge ya biologie ebalukaka yango moko, yango wana ekobaka kosala yango moko ata soki eza te ata na elembo moko euti libanda."" This means the biological clocks and rhythms they control continue even without external cues.
* **The passage also states:** ""Makambo mingi oyo emonana na bizaleli ya bato mpe na ndenge bato basalaka makambo etalelaka mbala mingi na bileko ebengami endogènes mpe basalaka yango na bamontre ya biologie."" This directly links the internal rhythms (that continue without external cues) to the ""endogenous"" cycles.

Therefore, endogenous cycles are what continue even in the absence of external signals.
"
Maloba nini elimboli malamu bato oyo bazali komonisa bilembo ya kolandana?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphic**.

The passage states: ""Soki bato mingi bamonisi lolenge mingi ekeseni ya ezaleli moko bablobaka bazali polymorphes."" which translates to ""If many people show many different forms of a characteristic, they are called polymorphes."" This directly relates to showing variations of traits.
"
Maloba nini na mae malandi ekokani na ba organes oyo evandi na esika songolo pakala?,"Maloba oyo ekokani na ba organes oyo evandi na esika songolo pakala, dictionnaire, to ""anatomie ya moto"" elobi te ete ""bato"" nde nde yango. Maloba oyo eleki kolakisa likanisi ya bato ya lolenge moko na lisanga moko nde ""monomorphic"". Yango wana, eyano ya malamu ezali:

**A: Monomorphic**
"
Nini na mae malandi ekoki te kozala Bozalisi ya nature ?,"Maloba oyo ezali malamu ezali **C: Kokende kotala Misee ya sience.**

Polozi ekomi lisusu ete Bozalisi ya nature etali kosala makambo oyo etali kolinga mpe koyekola kitoko ya biloko oyo eza na libanda. Koyekola musée ya science eza te na lolenge wana.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi ezali motuya pona lolenge ya transport?","The correct answer is **B: Mituka ya bato** (Private cars).

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the fact that *individual private cars* are the main mode of transport contributing to the problem. The passage specifically mentions ""ebongiseli ya transport oyo esalemaki na mituka ya bato bango moko"" (a transport system made up of individual private cars) as the problem.

Let's eliminate the others:

*   **A: Bisika ya kosala mosala (Workplaces):** Workplaces are not the focus of the passage. The problem lies in how people *get* to work.
*   **C: Biosphere ya kofanda esika moko (A habitable biosphere):** While the passage does mention the biosphere being negatively impacted, it's a consequence of the transport method, not the central focus.
*   **D: Lolenge ya bato kokola (The way humans thrive):** The passage says that the current mode of transportation is harming the biosphere which sustained human growth.

Therefore, the key factor regarding the mode of transport is the use of private cars.
"
Biteni oyo ezalaka nzinganzinga ya nucleus ezali na courant ya lolenge nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Courant ya mabe**

The passage states: ""Baelectron ezalaka na courant ya mabe."" Baelectrons are the particles orbiting the nucleus.
"
Nucleus ezalaka na biteni boni?,"The correct answer is **A: BaProtons na baNeutrons**.

The passage states: ""Noyau ezalaka na biteni mibale - baneutron na baproton."" (The nucleus is made of two parts - neutrons and protons.)
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ezali ndakisa ya botangi oyo ezali ya mitango binaire?","Likambo etali kotanga mitango ya binaire elobi ete elembo moko na moko esengeli kozala to 0 to 1. Na kati ya maponami oyo bapesaki, maponami nyonso ezali na elembo 0 mpe 1, kasi ezali na elembo mosusu te. Boye, maponami nyonso A, C, mpe D ezali ndakisa ya mitango ya binaire. Kasi, maponami B ezali na elembo 2, yango wana ezali mitango ya binaire te.

Lokola mituna etangi maloba ya binaire te na kati ya maloba ya nse, tokozwa ete bandakisa nyonso oyo ezali mitango ya binaire ezali eyano malamu. Yango wana, maponami A, C, mpe D ezali mpe malamu.
"
Kombo mosusu ya mitango ezalaka nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba bites**.

The passage states: ""...babengaka mintango wana mintango ya binaire - to bits, soki tosaleli elobeli ya bato ya ordinatere.""  This clearly indicates that ""bits"" is another name for those numbers (binary digits).
"
Nini na mae malandi ezali te kati ya litomba pona moyekoli kokoma na internet ?,"The correct answer is **B: Kokitisa kotongama na baninga** (Decreasing dependence on peers).

The passage states that blogging can improve writing skills, increase awareness of the world, and foster a desire to learn. It does not mention anything about decreasing dependence on peers. In fact, the collaborative nature of blogging might even suggest the opposite, increasing interaction and potentially some reliance on feedback from others.
"
Na mae matali kokoma na internet nini elobami kotinda bayekoli pona komatisa lolenge na bango ya kokoma?,"The correct answer is **B: Mposa ya koboya kotongama** (The desire to avoid criticism).

The passage states that students, wanting to avoid being criticized by their audience, will strive to improve their writing skills. This aligns directly with option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kolobelela mbala na mbala biloko kouta na internet** (Referencing sources on the internet repeatedly): While the passage mentions internet responses and research, it doesn't directly link repeated referencing to improved writing.
*   **C: Kosala ete bato oyo batangaka biloko na bango bakoma kotanga** (Making people who read their things write): The focus is on students *improving their writing*, not on making *readers* write.
*   **D: Mposa ya kosala elongo na basusu** (The desire to collaborate with others): While blogs encourage collaboration, the *primary* driver for improved writing mentioned in the passage is the desire to avoid criticism."
Nini na kati ya mae malandi ezali te litomba ya kosolola asynkrone pona bayekoli? ,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**B: Kokutana na bakambi moko na moko mikolo nyonso (Meeting instructors one-on-one every day)**

Here's why:

*   The passage highlights the benefits of asynchronous communication as flexibility in time and pace of learning. It states that it allows students to ask questions and receive answers promptly, *instead* of waiting for face-to-face meetings. This implies asynchronous learning does *not* guarantee or require daily in-person meetings with instructors.

The other options *are* mentioned as benefits or related to benefits in the passage:

*   A: Kosalela internet neti lisungi (Using the internet as support) - The passage explicitly mentions the use of the internet and websites to access information.
*   C: Ba ngonga malamu ya kosala musala (Flexible work hours) - The passage mentions fewer restrictions on scheduling work.
*   D: Kobatela vitesi (Maintaining pace) - The passage highlights the ability to work at one's own pace and follow the pace of the lessons."
"Kolanda maloba wana, eteni nini ya kosolola asynkrone ezali pete te pona bayekoli?","The correct answer is **C: Bisaleli ya ba ndingisa**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Lisusu, eza na bipekiseli moke na likoki ya kobongola bangonga ya mosala."" (""Also, there are few restrictions on the ability to change work schedules."") This means scheduling is *easier*, not difficult.
*   The text does not discuss that using the internet is difficult.
* The text specifically states that asynchrone learning allow to work at own learning pace.

Therefore, the other answer must be more of a difficulty to asynchronous learning."
Na maloba wana nini etangemi te lokola eloko oyo moto akoki kokokanisa yango na ba ndako ya medieval ya kala?,"The correct answer is **A: Mabulu ya molili** (Dark dungeons).

Here's why:

*   **The passage specifically mentions *feeling* the terror from the dungeons.** It does not say that one can imagine the dark dungeons.
*   **B: Ba joutes (Jousts), C: Chevalerie (Chivalry), and D: Bapunda (Horses)** are all explicitly mentioned as things that people *imagine* or associate with medieval castles."
Na maloba wana nini na mae malandi epatami te lokola solo to mongongo oyo ekoki kondimama kozala bobebi ya ndako?,"The correct answer is **B: Somo**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses ideas that may or may not be true. The passage specifically mentions ""somo (somo)"" as something one might *imagine* feeling in the dungeons (""koyoka bobangi ezouta na mabulu ya donjon""), but not as a definitive *feature* or *cause* of the castle's ruin.

The other options (bitumba, bafeti, basapatu) are more directly linked to activities and realities related to the historical life in a castle, even if the passage is questioning their exact nature or accuracy.
"
Nini na mae malandi elimboli malamu ndako ya Kirby Muxloe?,"The correct answer is **B: Na ngonga ya kotonga esengaki kokembisama mukie mpo kimia ezalaki na mboka na ngonga wana**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** The house was not built for serious defense because the area was relatively peaceful when construction began. It only needed to defend against small bands of robbers. This implies that the house was designed with less emphasis on defense and more on aesthetics because of the peaceful environment.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Bifelo ya ndako esengamaki na Lord Hastings:** While Lord Hastings did start building the house, the passage doesn't focus on the design of the walls specifically being due to him.
*   **C: Botongi ya ndako ekokanaki te na tango ya kala:** This is true in a way, but the *reason* for its unconventional construction (peaceful times) is more directly supported by the text.
*   **D: Etongamaki pona kotelemela bitumba ya molai mpe makasi:** The passage explicitly says the opposite. It wasn't built to withstand prolonged or serious attacks."
Lolenge nini elakisi ete botongi ya ndako Kirby Muxloe ezalaki ya bokeseni na tango ya kala oyo elobami na maloba wana?,"Eyano ya malamu ezali **D: Bifelo mikiemikie**.

Pesa ndimbola:

*   **Maloba elobi polele** ete ndako ya Kirby Muxloe ezalaki na ""bifelo na yango ya mike.""
*   Na ntango ya bitumba, bifelo ya mike ezalaki malamu te, kasi ezalaki lokola ntango ezalaki na kimia mpe mposa ya libateli ya makasi ezalaki mingi te.

Biyano mosusu ezali mpenza te:

*   **A: Maninisa minene:** Maloba emonisi kaka maninisa ya talatala, kasi emonisi te ete yango ezali lolenge oyo ezali na bokeseni.
*   **B: Fondation etongamaki pona kotelemela bitumba:** Maloba emonisi nde ndako yango etongamaki na ntango ya kimia, elingi koloba te ete ezali na fondation oyo etongamaki mpo na kolonga bitumba.
*   **C: Ekembisamaki mukie kokesana na bandako misusu:** Maloba elobi te likoló ya lolenge nini balakisaki na ndako yango."
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi ekoki kozala litomba monene pona atlete oyo azali kolengela saison?","The correct answer is **D: Kosala momesano na salle de sport pona kokembisa eteni ya likolo ya nzoto.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes:**
    * **Endurance is more important than speed** in longer distances (like the half-mile).
    * **Developing endurance during the off-season (winter)** through cross-country running and upper body exercises.
* **Why option D is the best fit:** The passage directly states that upper body exercises are a good way to prepare during the off-season.
* **Why the other options are less suitable:**
    * **A: Kopota mwa mbangu ya kokima na mboka na tango ya molunge:** The passage specifically mentions winter cross-country running as preparation.
    * **B: Kosala makasi pona komatisa vitesi na ngonga ya momesano to exercise:** The passage states that speed becomes less important as the distance increases.
    * **C: Kokokisa limite ya minute misato:** While a good time is mentioned for a shorter distance (2 minutes for a quarter-mile), the passage doesn't say anything about the 3-minute limit.

Therefore, option D directly reflects the text's advice on off-season training.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ezali ya motuya mingi pona atlete ya malamu ya half-mile?","The correct answer is **B: Kokolisa bopikiliki na esika ya mbangu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that once the distance increases to the half-mile, speed becomes less important and endurance becomes more important (""vitesse ekomaki ntina mingi te mpe kokanga motema ekomaki ntina mingi""). This directly supports the idea of prioritizing endurance over speed."
"Pona atlete , na mae malandi nini ekoki te kozuama kaka na nzela ya koliya malamu?","Based on the passage, eating well alone cannot guarantee everything an athlete needs, but it can greatly influence their well-being. Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Mosala ya malamu (Good work/Performance):** The passage states that good nutrition, hydration, and knowledge can help athletes improve their abilities. So, good performance CAN be influenced by eating well.

*   **B: Esengo ya mingi (More happiness/More Joy):** The passage mentions enjoying their sports more. This suggests that happiness related to sports can be influenced by eating well.

*   **C: Mosala ya malamu mingi (Very Good Work/Excellent Performance):** Similar to A, excellent performance can also be influenced by eating well, but not guaranteed by it alone.

*   **D: Kozala malamu na lolenge nyonso (Being well in every way/Holistic well-being):** While eating well contributes to overall well-being, it's not the only factor. Factors like mental health, social support, and other life aspects also play a crucial role. Therefore, eating well alone cannot guarantee holistic well-being.

**Conclusion:**

The passage implies that good nutrition is crucial but not the *only* factor for excellent performance, or complete joy. Therefore, **D: Kozala malamu na lolenge nyonso** is the correct answer. Eating well alone cannot ensure complete well-being in every aspect of life.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi toli nini oyo epesameli te na baatletes ya mikie mpona kozua esengo na spor na bango?","The passage says:

*   Good nutrition alone isn't enough, but it can positively impact young athletes.
*   Good physical health, staying hydrated, and knowing various things can improve performance and enjoyment.

Based on this, the passage suggests:

*   Good nutrition (Option A is related)
*   Staying hydrated (Option C)
*   Good physical health (Option D is related, meaning being physically strong)

The passage **does not** suggest that athletes should ""work very hard all the time"". The emphasis is on *overall* well-being and knowledge, not just pushing themselves constantly. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: Kosala mosala malamu mingi ngonga nyonso**
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, pona nini atlete ya course ya distance ndambu akoki kosomba esaleli ya talo mingi?","Eyano ya malamu ezali: **A: Ezali oyo alingi**

Posa elobeli ete, atlete akoki kosomba eloko ya talo mingi mpo alingi, ata soki eloko yango esalisi ye mingi te. Na maloba mosusu, ekoki kozala pona esengo na ye moko.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, course ya distance ndambu esengi nini?","The correct answer is **C: Bisaleli mukie** (Few materials).

The passage clearly states that middle-distance running doesn't require a lot of expensive equipment and that many things athletes think they need don't actually provide a real benefit. Therefore, few materials are needed.
"
Nani amonaki résonance magnétique nucléaire liboso? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch and Purcell**.

The passage states: ""Ekzame IRM esalemaka na kolanda likambo moko ya physique oyo babengaka résonance magnétique nucléaire (RMN), oyo babimisaki na mibu 1930 na Felix Bloch (oyo asalaka na Université ya Stanford) pe Edward Purcell (ya Université ya Harvard).""
"
Na mbula nini diplome ya yambo epesamaki pona bilili na résonance magnétique ? ,"The correct answer is **B: Mbula 1974**.

The text states: ""Mibu minei na nsima, bapesaki diplome, oyo ezalaki diplome ya liboso oyo bapesaki na makambo ya IRM."" and prior to this it states, ""Na mbula 1970, Raymond Damadian, monganga mpe molukiluki ya makambo ya siansi, amonaki bantina ya kosalela bilili na résonance magnétique mpona koyeba maladi.""
"
"Kolanada maloba wana, esengeli na bato kososola eloko nini makasi mingi pona kolimbola bizaleli ya komonana ya bato misusu?","Mpo na kolanda maloba wana, likambo ya ntina mingi ezali **B: Ntina**.

Maloba mamonisi ete tosengeli koluka ntina ya bizaleli ya moto liboso ya kosambisa ye. Na ndakisa, koluka ntina ya moto kobuka talatala ya motuka. Ntina ekoki kozala koyiba, kasi ekoki pe kozala koluka kokota na motuka na ye moko.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, kososola ntina esungaka bato pona kosala nini?","The correct answer is **C: Kotala bato misusu kozanga ko juger bango (To observe others without judging them)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes understanding intentions.** The example of the person breaking into a car highlights the importance of knowing *why* someone is doing something before judging their actions.  Understanding the intention (the person lost their keys vs. the person is stealing the car) changes how you perceive their behavior.
* **The other options are less directly relevant:**
    * **A: Kosilisa kozanga kondima na mae matali bizaleli ya komonana (Eliminating disbelief in matters related to visible behavior):** While understanding intentions can *lead* to less disbelief, it's not the primary function.
    * **B: Kolobela ba mposa (To express needs):** This is not the emphasis of the text.
    * **D: Kotanga makanisi ya basusu (To read the minds of others):** While the passage mentions ""kotanga makanisi ya basusu"" as a human ability, the example clarifies that the ability allows you to judge other people fairly.

Therefore, understanding intention directly leads to being able to observe others without prematurely judging their actions.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini kati ya mae malandi na kimukuse ekokani na litomba monene ya AI?","The correct answer is **D: Bosali mosala na mashine yemoko**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that AI's core purpose is to create machines that can perform tasks requiring intelligence.** This implies autonomy and the ability to work on their own.  The phrase ""andelaka bizaleli, mayele pe ndenge mashine emesanaka"" (behaves, has intelligence, and how machines adapt) directly supports this.
* **A: Kolengela (Translation: Prediction):** While AI can be used for prediction, it's not the *primary* or *biggest* benefit highlighted in the passage. Prediction is often a tool used within AI, not its defining characteristic.
* **B: Bososoli mongongo (Translation: Speech recognition):** Speech recognition is *an example* of what AI can do, but not its overall benefit.
* **C: Kolengela ntango (Translation: Time management):** Time management is not directly addressed in the passage as a main benefit of AI.

Therefore, **D** most closely aligns with the core idea of AI presented in the passage: creating machines that can operate independently and intelligently.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi oyo elandana mingi na AI?","According to the passage, Artificial Intelligence (AI) includes ""kozwa mikano pe kobongisa makambo, makoki ya kokokisa bamposa ya bakiliya mpe kopesa biyano na mituna na bango, mpe koyeba makambo bakomi na maboko, mongongo mpe elongi.""

Of the options provided:

*   **A: Service client** directly relates to the AI's ability to ""kokokisa bamposa ya bakiliya mpe kopesa biyano na mituna na bango"" (meeting customer needs and answering their questions).
*   **D: Bososoli ya makomi ya maboko** (Understanding handwriting) is specifically mentioned in the passage as an example of AI.

Option D is a more specific example, while A is a broader application mentioned. Since the question asks which option is *most* closely related, A is a more comprehensive answer. Therefore, the answer is A.

*   **C: Siance fiction** Eza lisolo babongisa, kasi eteni ya AI te

*   **B: Kobongisa mpe kolengela ba ngonga ya mosala** (Organizing and preparing work schedules) is not directly discussed in the passage.

**So the best answer is A and D**, but since only a single choice is allowed, A is broader so is the correct one.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi ezalaka makasi ya moto oyo azalaka na ndenge ya kokanisa","Based on the provided text, the answer is **D: Lolenge ya kobomba makambo na kati ya mayele**.

Here's why:

*   The text emphasizes that analytical thinking involves drawing on past knowledge and experiences.
*   Analytical thinking relies on identifying the single correct answer.
*   Analytical thinkers are good at retaining information.

The other options are incorrect because they contradict the description of analytical thinking in the text:

*   **A: Kopona biyano ebele ya malamu na kati ya likambo songolo pakala:** The text states that there is only one correct answer in analytical thinking.
*   **B: Kosalela balolenge ebele na kati ya likambo:** The text describes analytical thinking as focused on logic and established methods, not multiple approaches.
*   **C: Kozua ngonga oyo esengeli pona kozua eyano na likambo:** While efficiency is mentioned, the core focus is on accuracy and truth.

Therefore, the capacity to store information in memory aligns with the description of analytical thinking."
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi endimami te kotalela makasi ndenge ya kokanisa?","The correct answer is **B: Kozua ngonga oyo esengeli** (Taking the time needed).

Here's why:

*   **A: Kososola ete eyano ya malamu ezali kaka moko (Understanding that there is only one correct answer)**: The text states that the most important thing in this type of thinking is that there is only one correct answer (eyano ya solo eza kaka moko).

*   **C: Kososola bosolo (Understanding truth)**: The text explicitly mentions ""koyeba makambo ya solo"" (knowing true information) as a key part of this way of thinking.

*   **D: Kosangisa ba nsango (Combining information)**: The text states that it involves ""kosalela lisusu mayele ya kala ya kosangisa basango"" (reusing old methods of combining information).

*   **B: Kozua ngonga oyo esengeli (Taking the time needed)**: While efficiency and speed are mentioned (vitese), the text doesn't say that *taking time* is explicitly valued. In fact, the implication is that this type of thinking is supposed to be quick. The question asks what is *not* valued.

Therefore, taking the time needed is *not* explicitly endorsed by the text as a core aspect of this thinking style."
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi ekoki te kondimama lokola micro-expresion?","The correct answer is **D: Komatisa mosapi munene ya loboko likolo**.

Here's why:

* **Micro-expressions** are brief, involuntary facial expressions that reveal a person's true emotions. The prompt emphasizes these are fleeting (lasting only a fraction of a second).

* **A, B, and C** (Kotala pembeni na ngonga ya kosolola, Kozipazipa miso, Kobetabeta miso mbangu mbangu) can all be subtle, quick gestures or facial movements that *could* be considered micro-expressions depending on the context and how rapidly they occur.

* **D** (Komatisa mosapi munene ya loboko likolo - Thumbs up) is a conscious, deliberate gesture. It is not an involuntary expression of emotion. Therefore, it cannot be a micro-expression.

Therefore, D is the only option that cannot be a micro-expression.
"
Na maloba ya bolimboli micro-expresion mae malandi nini ezali solo te?,"The correct answer is **A: Kosala enregistrement ya video emema makambo mingi te.**

Here's why:

*   The passage *explicitly* states that video recording *does* help in detecting micro-expressions. It says ""Kosalela enregistrement ya video emema na koyeba makambo mingi na oyo etali koyeba bilembo ya elongo..."" (Using video recording leads to knowing many things regarding detecting facial expressions). Therefore, the statement in option A is false.

*   The other options are supported by the text:

    *   **B: Bolimboli ya malamu ekoki komonisa lokuta** (Good interpretation can reveal a lie): This is directly implied by the first sentence regarding detecting lies from fleeting facial expressions.
    *   **C: Maloba mpe bizaleli ya elongi esosolami malamu** (Words and facial expressions are well understood): The passage talks about analysing words and facial expressions, so this statement aligns with that.
    *   **D: Ekoki kosalisa komeka bosolo** (It can help test the truth): This is also tied to the idea of using micro-expressions to detect lies and therefore assess the truth.
"
Na mae malandi nini ekomaki ya motuya mingi kouta na Renaissance? ,"The correct answer is **A: Mayele ya kokanisa**.

The passage states ""...mayele ya kokanisa maloba ekomaki ntina mingi koleka."" This directly translates to ""the ability to reason became more important."" Therefore, option A is the best answer.
"
"Kolanda boyei ya kobotama lisusu , eloko nini na mae malandi ezuamaki lisusu na litomba mingi te?","According to the text (P), the importance of inviting people decreased, while the ability to interpret written words became more important. This suggests a shift in focus towards written materials and individual interpretation.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Mayele ya kokanisa (The art of inviting)**. The passage states that the ability to invite people became less important during the Renaissance. The other options (knowledge acquisition, written interpretation, and information spread) all became *more* important or were a consequence of the shift.
"
Na mae malandi nini emonisi te ntina ya kosalela internet pona bokobi ya ba relations ?,"Réponse correcte : **B: Kosolola na libota ngonga nyonso**

Explication :

*   Liyebisi P elobi ete ""kokoba boyokani"" eza moko ya bilendiseli ya ntina ya kosalela internet. Kosolola na libota ngonga nyonso eza ndakisa malamu ya kokoba boyokani na bato ozali na bango na boyokani.

*   D: Kokutana na bato ya sika ekokani na kokoba boyokani te."
Na mae malandi nini emonisi te ntina ya kosalela internet pona makambo ya moto yemoko?,"According to the text, the motives for using the internet include ""learning,"" ""connecting with others,"" ""self-gratification,"" and ""relationship maintenance.""

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Kotala lolenge ya kosala eloko (Looking at how to make something/Instructions):** This could be related to ""learning"" if someone is looking up how to do something.
*   **B: Kotia masolo ya internet na ecran (Putting internet stories on the screen):** This is a technological action, not a motivation.
*   **C: Kosala bolukiluki ya bakisi pona kolongono ya nzoto (Researching medicine for health):** This could be related to ""learning"" and also potentially ""relationship maintenance"" if someone is researching for a loved one.
*   **D: Koyeba kosalela mbongo (Knowing how to use money):** This could be related to ""learning.""

Out of these options, **A and C** best reflect the motivations mentioned in the text (learning and potentially relationship maintenance). However, the core motivation of wanting to ""learn"" how to make something is more directly aligned with the passage.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

**A: Kotala lolenge ya kosala eloko**"
Na ngonga nini Erope ya Est etikaki kolanda makasi bizaleli ya basusu mpe kobanda kosala makambo lolenge na yango moko?,"Mpo na koyanola na motuna oyo, tosengeli kotala makambo oyo bazali koloba na kati ya lisolo.

"
Kosalela babutons pona kokanga bilamba ezalaki eyano kouta wapi? ,"The correct answer is **C: The Crusades**.

The passage states: ""...Moko ya bokoli ya koleka monene ya ntango wana nsima ya bitumba babengi croisades, bato babandaki kosalela baboutons mpona kokanga bilamba."" (One of the biggest developments of that time, after the crusades, people started using buttons to fasten clothes.)
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ezuami kozala eyano pona ngonga molai na mae matali mikakatano ya esika tofandaka?","The correct answer is **C: Kososola ba ntina ya ba problemes (Understanding the root causes of the problems)**

Here's why:

* **P's Argument:** The passage argues against temporary solutions (treating symptoms). It emphasizes the need to find and eliminate the root causes of environmental problems.

* **Connecting to Options:**
    * **A: Kotika bomoi ya mindondo (Abandoning a complex life):** While simplification might be part of a solution, the passage doesn't directly state that abandoning complexity is the *only* answer.
    * **B: Activisme to kmisusu lolenge ya kobika (Activism or modifying the way of life):** Activism can be helpful, but it's a *method*. The passage focuses on *understanding* the problem first. Modifying the way of life, similarly, could be part of the solution, but it's not the core focus the text is emphasizing.
    * **C: Kososola ba ntina ya ba problemes (Understanding the root causes of the problems):** This aligns perfectly with the passage's central argument: to address problems long-term, you must understand and tackle their underlying causes.
    * **D: Kokoma moninga ya Makita pona esika tofandaka (Becoming a friend of Makita for the place where we live):** This option is irrelevant to the passage's main points.

Therefore, understanding the root causes is the crucial first step according to the passage for long-term solutions.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, kati ya biyano elandi eyano nini ekoki te kondimama lokola eyano pona ngonga mokuse na mikakatano ya esika tofandaka?","The correct answer is **B: Kolongola ebandeli ya mikakatano**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly contrasts ""solutions ya ntango moke"" (short-term solutions) with addressing the root cause (""esika makambo euti, pe kolongola yango""). The passage also states, ""... soki tolingi kaka te solution ya ntango moke, wana tosengeli koluka esika makambo euti, pe kolongola yango.""

*   Therefore, ""Kolongola ebandeli ya mikakatano"" (removing the root of the problems) is presented as the *opposite* of a short-term solution. The other options (activism, addressing complex living, improving the area we live) could be considered actions that might bring about immediate changes, but are not directly addressing the origin of the problems.

Therefore, B is not a solution to the problem's short term."
Na Mboka nini bitumba ebandaki liboso na Erope oyo likambo ya makasi ezalaki kowela kibokonzi koleka makambo ya mangomba ?,"The text states that the War of the Spanish Succession was the first European war where the central issue was the balance of power. This war revolved around who would succeed to the Spanish throne.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: Espagne**
"
Etumba nini tango mosusu ezuamaka lokola “etumba ya mangomba” ya suka?,"The correct answer is **A: Etumba ya mbula tuku zomi na misato**.

The text explicitly states: ""Yango wana, bitumba ya Mibu Tuku Misato ezalaki bitumba ya suka oyo babengaki ya losambo."" (Therefore, the Thirty Years' War was the last war to be called a religious one.)
"
Na mae malandi eteni nini ya Lingomba Katolike ezalaki kotalema te?,"The correct answer is **D: Soki mibeko ya motuya ya Lingomba ezalaki kotosama.**

The passage states that the Church's enormous wealth and power, coupled with its teachings about using wealth to alleviate suffering and poverty, led to questions about whether those values were actually being upheld (""kotia bokonzi mpe mbongo esika moko ebimisa mituna mingi bazotosa mobeko wana""). This directly implies scrutiny of whether the Church was truly adhering to its own principles.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nani babomaki ye na Versailles?","The correct answer is **D: Mokengeli moko** (A soldier).

The passage states that ""moto moko na kati ya bato ya mobulu aningisaki moto ya soda moko ya mokonzi oyo babomaki na Versailles liboso ya mokonzi-mwasi oyo azalaki kobanga makasi,"" which translates to ""someone from the mob shook a soldier of the king who was killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.""
"
Kati ya mae malandi nini oyo etuluku ya bato etindaki te mokonzi mpe mwasi naye basala na makasi?,"The correct answer is **C: Kotala lolenge mokengeli azali kokatema kingo**.

The passage states that a guard was killed in front of the Queen at Versailles *before* the journey to Paris.  It doesn't say the crowd *forced* them to watch the execution. The rest of the options (A, B, and D) are all explicitly mentioned as actions the crowd compelled the royal family to take.

"Kolanda maloba wana, bato basalaka mosala ya mbala na mbala basengeli na lisungi pona nini?","Based on the text provided, the correct answer is:

**A: Emoneli mabe pona mae matali pasi** (Negative beliefs about pain)

The passage explicitly states that ""Bato oyo basalaka misala mbala na mbala baza na mposa ya lisungi mingi na oyo etali lolenge ya mabe ya kotalela mpasi..."" (People who exercise regularly need more help regarding negative ways of thinking about pain...). This directly connects regular exercise to a need for support in addressing negative perceptions about pain.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, masano ya escrime ebetamaka ndenge nini?","The correct answer is **D: Na lolenge ya bitumba**.

While the passage mentions that fencing is played at universities and the Olympics, the fundamental aspect of the sport described is that it is played between two people fighting each other. Thus, ""Na lolenge ya bitumba"" (in a manner of fighting/combat) is the most accurate and direct answer based on the provided text.

"Kolanda botomboki ya ba francais, elonga kati ya mapinga mpe na misala misusu ekokaki kozala penza te na pona nini?","The correct answer is **B: Classe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Botomboki ya France epesaki mpe makanisi na bato mosusu ya misala oyo bazalaki koniokola mikili mosusu na kobanda botomboki na bango moko."" This shows that social class was an important aspect of the revolution because there was social mobility by people in the work that could not be achieved before.
"
Mosala nini ya leta oyo elobami kosala bato kozanga esengo na ba mboka oyo ekoba liboso?,"The correct answer is **C: Transport ya bato nyonso**.

The passage explicitly states that public transportation is the service that people complain about. The rest of the options are ruled out because the passage highlights the absence of complaints about water and dams. While education might be a source of complaint, it is not mentioned in the passage, making C the most logical answer.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ekoki kolobama na mae malandi transport pona bato nyonso?","The best answer is **C: Esalaka ete bato oyo basalelaka yango balobaloba mingi** (It makes the people who use it complain a lot).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that ""Bato nyonso bazalaki komilela mpona transport yango"" (Everyone was complaining about the transport).

The other options are incorrect based on the text:

* **A: Elingami na bato nyonso oyo basalelaka yango:** This is the opposite of what the passage says.
* **B: Ezali mabe penza te lokola mai:** The passage contrasts transport with water and infrastructure in wealthy countries, implying transport *is* a bigger problem.
* **D: Ezali ya ofele na ba mboka mingi oyo ekoba liboso:** The passage doesn't mention anything about the cost or freeness of public transportation.

* The passage focuses on modeling traffic flow, which is about how traffic *behaves* on the road. It mentions débit (flow rate), densité (density), and vitese (speed) as key elements for modeling. These are all related to how the road is being used and how traffic is moving.
* The passage also says that modelling the driver (option B) is difficult.
* Options C and D, while potentially related to traffic, are not the primary focus of mathematical modeling as described in the passage. The passage concentrates on flow, density, and speed.

The text mentions the following reasons why ancient people kept goats:

*   **Miliki** (Milk) - D is a correct reason.
*   **Suki** (Wool)
*   **Misuni** (Meat) - A (""nyama ya koliya"") means ""meat to eat,"" so this is a correct reason.
*   **Bamposo** (Skins)
*   **Kobika elongo na bato** (to live along with people) - C is a correct reason

The text doesn't say that goats helped graze the grass. In fact, it implies the opposite: goats were taken to places with grass to eat.

Explanation:

The text says ""Joueur oyo abetaka banzete moko to oyo asalelaka diemba mingi, to mpona kosilisa pe kolonga."" which translates to ""The player who hits the fewest strokes or uses the least amount of attempts, wins.""

Therefore, the goal is to use the least amount of strokes/attempts (badiemba).

The passage states: ""matiti ya zingazinga ya libulu bakataka yango mpo ezala mokuse pe babengaka yango green"" which translates to ""the grass around the hole is cut short and it's called the green"". Therefore, the grass is cut short on the green.

"Kolanda maloba wana, maloba nini kati ya mae malandi esosolisi malamu ba mpela ebele?","The correct answers are **B** and **D**.

*   **B: Ebotaka mipepe pene ya 480 kilometres per heuere** (It generates winds close to 480 kilometers per hour) - The passage states ""Mipepe wana ya mabe ekoki kokoma kino na 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).""

*   **D: Bazali na makoki ya kotimola banzete na mabele** (They have the ability to uproot trees from the ground) - The passage states ""Mpela etumolaka banzete..."" (The tornado uproots trees...).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ewumelaka mingimingi koleka bangonga misato** (It usually lasts more than three hours) - The passage mentions that two powerful tornadoes *in a book* lasted over three hours. This doesn't mean all tornadoes last this long.

*   **C: Ebetaka bisika minene koleka mipepe misusu** (It hits larger areas than other winds) - The passage says tornadoes are *localized* compared to other strong winds, meaning they affect smaller areas.

Kati na mae malandi bato ba bandaki kosala nini na ekeke ya 16?,"The correct answer is **D: Kosala batelescope**

The passage states that the first true telescope was made in Europe at the end of the 16th century. Therefore, during the 16th century people started making telescopes.
"
Pona ngonga boni bato basili kokokomisa biloko mineneminene na nzela ya maneti?,"The correct answer is **C: Pona bambula nkoto**.

The passage states that lenses have been used ""mpona bambula mingi mpenza"" which translates to ""for a very long time."" This indicates a period far longer than just the 16th century or the last few centuries. ""Bambula nkoto"" translates to ""thousands of years,"" which aligns with the idea of lenses being used for a very long time.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, libulu ya Muhammad elobi nini na mae matali mimesano naye ya kimolimo to bizaleli ya malamu?","The most accurate answer based on the text is **A: Abatelaka makasi kimia mpe kozala yemoko.**

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes Muhammad's dedication to spiritual contemplation, his retreat to a secluded cave (""Hira"") away from the world (""mosika na mokili mobimba""), and the complete isolation he experienced within the cave (""Eloko moko te ekoki komonana longola kaka likolo oyo eza polele pe kitoko mpe bangomba kitoko ya zingazinga. Moto moko te akokaki koyoka to komona yango soki aza na kati ya libulu""). These details all point to a desire for peace and solitude to facilitate his spiritual practices.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Makelele ya libanda ekoki kosunga komaniola** The text explicitly says the cave is isolated from the outside world, meaning noise would be minimal.

*   **C: Azalaki na mposa ya kozala yemoko pona ngonga mukuse** The text implies a longer commitment to solitude, as he ""azalaki komipesa mingi na makambo oyo eleki bomoi oyo ya mosuni"" and frequently went to the cave to contemplate. It wasn't just a quick getaway.

*   **D: Akokaki kozela te bato bamona mpe koyoka ye** The text says the opposite. He chose a place where no one could see or hear him."
"Kolanda maloba wana, libende ebandaki kosalema yambo mpona bosenga nini?","The correct answer is **B: Banzela ya bingbunduku**.

The passage states: ""Kasi, malembemalembe, bamonaki ete banzela ekozala malamu soki eza na eloko ya libende na likolo na yango."" This translates to: ""But slowly, they realized that the paths would be better if there was something of iron on top of them."" This clearly indicates that iron was initially used to improve the wagonways (banzela ya bingbunduku).

"Kolanda maloba wana, pona nini nzela ya engbunduka ya mabaya embongwanaki pona kotiya nzela ya engbunduka ya mabende?","The correct answer is **B: Emonanaki kozala makasi mpe malamu mingi** (It was found to be stronger and better).

While the passage mentions increased speed and carrying capacity as benefits of *wagonways* in general, the shift from wooden rails to iron rails happened because they were found to be a more durable and effective solution.  The passage states: ""...bamonaki ete banzela ekozala malamu soki eza na eloko ya libende na likolo na yango"" (they found that the tracks would be better if they had iron on top).  This implies that the perceived strength and durability of iron was the primary reason for the change.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na tango ya BaRoma nini emonisaki bato lolenge ya kozala?","The correct answer is **B: Geografie**.

The passage states: ""Na makambo ya Roma, esika bato bafandaki ezalaki na bopusi na makanisi na bango, mpe na nsima bizaleli mpe bokoko ya esika wana ebimaki..."" This clearly indicates that the geography (esika bato bafandaki - the place where people lived) had a direct influence on their thoughts, behaviors, and culture.

"Kolanda maloba wana, kati ya mae malandi nini ekokani na mongongo ya malamu mingi?","According to the text, a down bow stroke produces a ""stronger and more beautiful"" sound. Therefore, the best match for a good tone is:

*   **A: Elembo ya down bow** (Down bow mark)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kobenda bow** (Pulling the bow) - This is a general description of an action, not a specific symbol or sound quality. While pulling the bow is *part* of a down bow, it's not the whole answer.
*   **C: Elembo oyo ezali komonana lokola V** (The symbol that looks like a V) - This describes the up bow symbol, which produces a *quieter* sound.
*   **D: Kobanda esika oyo loboko nayo ezali kosimba bow** (Starting where your arm holds the bow) - This describes the *starting point* of a down bow, but doesn't directly relate to the sound quality itself.

Mikwa ya kala emonisi maboko ekomaki kosalema mpona motindi nini kati ya mae malandi?,"The correct answer is **A: Kosala na maboko**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that hominids (including humans) *don't* use their arms for locomotion or weight-bearing. This eliminates options B, C and D.
*   The passage highlights the difference between ape arms (suited for locomotion and weight-bearing) and human arms (shorter, straighter phalanges). This difference suggests that human hands evolved to be suitable for activities other than walking or carrying weight. While the passage doesn't explicitly state ""making tools,"" the implication is that the hand evolved for finer manipulation and dexterity, which is essential for tool use, which falls under the broader category of ""Kosala na maboko"".

Therefore, the evidence points to the adaptation of human hands for skillful work."
Na mae malandi nini elobeli malamu baphalanges ya mokomboso ? ,"The correct answer is **C: Esalemaka pona komema mikumba.**

Here's why:

* **The original text says:** ""Liboko na likolo ya munkomboso eza molai mpe monene ndenge moko, ezomonisa ete asalelaka maboko mpona komema bakilo ntango azotambola.""  This directly links the structure of the ape's limbs to weight-bearing during locomotion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ezali semba koleka maboko ya moto:**  The text says human phalanges are straight, it doesn't compare ape phalanges to human ones in terms of straightness.
* **B: Maboko mpe makolo nabango ekeseni na kimolai:**  The text only mentions that the upper and lower arms of apes are the same size and that the arms of humans are shorter than legs.
* **D: Ezalaka yambo pona kosalela:** The passage talks about current function, not past function or how things used to be.
"
Boponami elongolaka variation genetique na pole nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Ya komonana**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that natural selection acts on the *observable* traits (what is ""yeyebana"" - known or observable - in the text), which are the result of the *expressed* (yeyebana - observable) genes. Natural selection *eliminates* unfavorable traits, thus reducing the genetic variation present in those observable characteristics. Hidden genes are not directly acted upon by the selection process."

"Kolanda bansango na maloba wana, na mae malandi nini oyo esengeli nyama primate aliya pona kosilisa “likambo ya vitamine?”","The correct answer is **C: Banyama mikiemikie oyo baliaka matiti** (Small animals that eat plants).

Here's why:

* **The problem:** Primates in the rainforest struggle to get enough amino acids from the plants available. This deficiency leads to negative consequences.
* **Human solution (usually):** Humans easily get protein from grains and vegetables, but primates struggle to digest these without cooking them.
* **Primate solution (implied):** Small animals provide easily digestible protein with essential amino acids. The passage specifically mentions ants, termites, and larvae as examples. Thus, eating small, herbivorous animals would solve the ""vitamin issue"" by providing those missing amino acids.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: Matiti ya kokauka (Dry grasses)** The passage states that primates struggle to get enough amino acids from the available plants.
* **B: Bandunda ya mobesu (Raw vegetables)** Same as above.
* **D: Nzete ya fololo (Flowering plants)**  Also plants that do not provide enough essential amino acids for primates.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, kati ya makambo oyo elandi likambo nini esalemaka te pona kozanga aside amino ya ntina?","The correct answer is **C: Mikakatano pona kokola**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    *   ""koniokwama makasi na makanisi"" (severe psychological suffering)
    *   ""kolia malamu te"" (poor nutrition/eating poorly)
    *   ""sukasuka liwa"" (eventually death)
    *   ""bilei euti na banyama (fourmis, termites, maki) esilaka malamu na libumu"" (digestion problems if no essential amino acids)

*   **The passage does NOT mention:**
    *   ""Mikakatano pona kokola"" (Problems growing).
    While it's possible growth could be affected indirectly, the passage doesn't explicitly state this as a direct consequence of amino acid deficiency in primates."
Lolenge nini bakitani ya molende mbala na mbala bamonisaka kozala nabango kati ya likita?,"Based on the definition of a subculture provided in statement P, the best answer is:

**D: Na nzela ya kosalela ndenge ya kobika lokola elembo (Through using a shared way of life as a symbol)**

Here's why:

*   Statement P emphasizes that subcultures often express membership through clear symbols and behaviors. Option D, ""using a shared way of life as a symbol,"" aligns directly with this. Shared ways of life often include slang, fashion, behaviors, and values. These elements are symbols that represent the subculture.
Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:
*   **A: Na nzela ya komeka komiyoka nsomi na kati (By trying to feel internally free):** While subcultures can offer a sense of freedom, this is more of a consequence than a defining characteristic of demonstrating membership.
*   **B: Na nzela ya kolanda bondimeli ya moto nyonso nzinganzinga (By following the beliefs of everyone around):** Subcultures often deviate from mainstream beliefs, so following the beliefs of everyone around would not generally demonstrate their belonging to the subculture.
*   **C: Na nzela ya kondima mibeko ya likita (By agreeing to group norms):** Though Subculture members may follow certain norms, those norms are those of the subculture. Also, Statement P says that often subcultures do not comply with mainstream laws.

**Therefore, option D is the most accurate because it aligns directly with the definition of how subculture membership is expressed.**"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Children develop an understanding of race early and that this understanding can influence their behavior. Specifically, it mentions how minority children might react differently in school based on their awareness of racial stereotypes.
* **Connecting to the question:** If a child is aware of racism, that awareness will significantly impact how they interact with children of different races, and possibly even children of their own race.  They might be more cautious, defensive, assertive, or withdrawn, depending on their experiences and understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ekolo to mposo ya nzoto ya mukie oyo aponi lokola yaye (The race or skin color of the child he/she chooses as his/her own):** While racial awareness *might* influence who a child identifies with, it's not the primary or most direct impact. A child might be forced to identify with their race even if they don't want to because of racism.
* **B: Bizaleli naye (His/her behavior):** This is too broad.  The passage is about *specific* behavior influenced by racial awareness, particularly in a social context. Option C is more precise.
* **D: Lolenge naye ya kolimbola mposo ya nzoto (His/her way of explaining skin color):** This is about understanding and describing race, which is related but not the core issue. The passage is more focused on the *impact* of racial awareness on behavior, not just understanding it.

Therefore, **C** is the most direct and relevant consequence of a child being aware of racism, according to the passage.

"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ekoki te komonana bokolisi ya mwana “feral” to mwana ya zamba?","The correct answer is **B: Lolenge makasi ya kosolola**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes ""feral"" children as those who lack socialization. They are often fearful of or uninterested in humans. They might even exhibit animal-like behaviors.
*   Options A, C, and D are all consistent with the characteristics of a feral child: surviving alone, preferring isolation, and lacking social skills.
*   Option B, ""Lolenge makasi ya kosolola"" (A strong way of communicating) is *not* a characteristic associated with feral children. In fact, they would likely have difficulty with communication.

Therefore, B is the answer choice that *cannot* be seen as a sign of the upbringing of a ""feral"" child."
"Kolanda maloba wana, kati ya mae malandi nini elimboli malamu bizaleli ya zamba na bana ?","The correct answer is **B: Bizaleli ya zamba ekoki kouta na kozanga kobika na bato.**

Here's why:

*   **P** describes how ""feral"" children develop unique behaviors due to a lack of human interaction and, in some cases, being raised by animals. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that bizaleli ya zamba, or feral traits, can arise from living without other people.
*   **A** The text says ""soki bakokoli mwana na banyama oyo eza te bato, mwana wana azalaka na bizaleli (na makambo ya nzoto) oyo ekokani na oyo ya banyama oyo babaelaki ye, na ndakisa kobanga bato to kosepela na bango te"". Therefore, A is wrong.
*   **C** The passage mentions that some feral children were confined by their parents, but it is not the only reason. Other reasons were children being abandoned or running away.
*   **D** The passage does not mention that all feral traits come from mental problems."

Kokende na musee ekoki kozala na lolenge nini ya tourisme?,"The correct answer is **C: Tourisme ya koyeba bokoko**.

Here's why:

The passage describes ""kokende kotala esika mpona koyeba bokoko"" as visiting places to learn about history and culture. Museums are prime locations for experiencing history and culture. Therefore, visiting a museum falls under the category of ""tourisme ya koyeba bokoko"" (cultural tourism).
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ekoki kozala ya litomba pona basali mobembo ya tourisme ya recreation?","The passage states that recreational tourism involves going to places different from daily life to relax and have fun. Therefore, the best answer is:

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Komizindisa mobimba na bango na kibokoko ya esika (Completely immersing themselves in the culture of the place):** This is more characteristic of cultural tourism, as the passage mentions.
*   **C: Komona bamboka na bisika ya malonga (Seeing villages in beautiful places):** While recreational tourism might involve seeing beautiful places, the primary goal is relaxation and enjoyment, not necessarily seeing specific types of locations.
*   **D: Kososola istware ya Esika (Understanding the history of the place):** This is also more related to cultural tourism."

The passage explicitly states that ""Kokundwela bizaleli ya kala ya kokamba mosala pe bolongi oyo bazwaki esalisaka bato na kosala mbongwana ya sika..."" which translates to ""Remembering the past characteristics of leadership and the successes they achieved helps people make new changes..."" This directly supports the idea that knowing the history of the association helps reduce fear of change. While understanding the other options could contribute to a positive environment, the text *specifically* links historical awareness to reducing fear of change.
"
"Kolanda na maloba wana, kozua bososoli ya lisaponge nayo ekosunga moto na nini?","The correct answer is **A: Kokitisa kobanga ya mbongwana** (Reduce the fear of change).

The passage specifically states: ""Masolo wana ya kolonga ekitisaka bobangi ya mbongwana, ebimisaka mpe makanisi malamu mpona mbongwana ekosalema na mikolo ezoya."" (Those stories of success reduce the fear of change and generate good ideas for future changes.)

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Kolendisa bizaleli ya malamu** (Strengthen good behaviors): While understanding the past can *influence* behavior, the passage focuses more directly on overcoming the fear of change.
*   **C: Kozua esika ya kobika na kati ya lisanga** (Finding a place to live within the association): The text doesn't imply the ability to find housing.
*   **D: Kokolisa bizaleli ya kimombongo** (Developing commercial qualities): The passage makes no mention of commercial or economic qualities.

Therefore, the passage primarily emphasizes that understanding historical successes helps to **reduce the fear of change.**"
Na maloba mae malandi ya wapi elimboli malamu mayele ya koyekola oyo ebengami postmoderne?,"Response D: Biloko ya mobimba ezalaka te na ngonga ya boyekoli.

**Explanation**

The passage emphasizes the freedom and multiplicity of learning styles in postmodern thought. It highlights the idea that learning is a relationship between the learner and the knowledge they are receiving, and that much of the information we consume through media is not directly applied or integrated into our lives in a holistic way.

Let's break down why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Balolenge misusu ya koyekola ezali na litomba koleka misusu (Some ways of learning are more useful than others):** The passage doesn't explicitly argue that some methods are *more useful*. It focuses on the idea that learning is varied and personalized.
*   **B: Koyekola esengelaki kotalela mingi mingi biloko oyo tondimi ete tokomona yango kokokisama (Learning should primarily consider things we believe we will see fulfilled):** The passage doesn't focus on anticipating fulfillment but emphasizes the vast amount of information we consume without necessarily expecting to apply it directly.
*   **C: Balolenge misusu ya koyekola ezali malamu koleka misusu (Some ways of learning are better than others):** Similar to option A, the text doesn't establish an explicit hierarchy of learning methods, but emphasizes freedom in the choice of the learning method.

Therefore, option **D (Biloko ya mobimba ezalaka te na ngonga ya boyekoli / Wholes are not necessary during the study period)** best captures the essence of the passage's perspective on postmodern learning, which is about the lack of wholeness in what we learn from television."
Maloba nini na mae malandi elimboli malamu te mayele ya koyekola oyo ebengami post modern learning approach ?,"The best answer is **B: Balolenge misusu ya koyekola esengeli kosalema mingi mingi koleka misusu (Some ways of learning should be done more than others).**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the abundance of learning methods in the postmodern approach.** It states that ""the best way to learn is multiple."" This directly contradicts the idea that *some* ways are superior and should be prioritized.

Let's look at why the other options are not as strong:

* **A: Lolenge ya koyekola bansango ezali ebele (The way to learn information is abundant).** This is TRUE and directly supported by the text. It speaks to the variety of learning methods.

* **C: Lolenge ya koyekola etalaka mingi moyekoli mpe malakisi oyo ezali kopesama (The way of learning looks at the learner and what is being taught).** This is also TRUE and aligns with the passage's statement that ""Learning is done in a relationship between the learner and the knowledge they are being given.""

* **D: Malakisi oyo tokoki te kosalela yango mokolo moko ezali na litomba koyekola (Lessons that we cannot use one day are beneficial to learn).** While the passage *implies* a potential criticism of learning things with no practical application, it doesn't explicitly state that those lessons are still *beneficial*. This option requires more interpretation.

Therefore, option B is the *most* contradictory to the central idea of the passage regarding the postmodern learning approach. It incorrectly suggests a hierarchy of learning methods, while the text champions the diversity and individualistic nature of learning in the postmodern era."
"Sima ya kolamuka yomoko na ngonga ya pongi, nini na mae malandi ekoki kosala eloko somgolo pakala na eteni ya bokati pongi?","The correct answer is **B: Kokende na toilete mpe kozonga na mbeto mbala moko** (Going to the toilet and returning to bed immediately).

Here's why:

*   **The passage explains ""Kokata pongi"" (sleep inertia) and methods to achieve it:** It states that it involves waking up and falling back asleep after a short period (10-60 minutes). One mentioned method is to consume liquid before bed to require a bathroom visit which helps break the sleep cycle.
*   **Options analysis:**
    *   **A: Kotanga pona ngonga moko na ndambu liboso ya kozonga na pongi** (Reading for an hour and a half before going back to sleep): This is too long and goes against the short interruption timeframe described in the passage.
    *   **B: Kokende na toilete mpe kozonga na mbeto mbala moko** (Going to the toilet and returning to bed immediately): This aligns with the strategy of disrupting sleep slightly and then quickly returning to bed to initiate the ""kokata pongi"".
    *   **C: Koboma alarme nayo mpe kolala sima ya ngonga tukumibale** (Turning off your alarm and sleeping for twelve hours): This defeats the purpose of waking up and falling back asleep within a specific timeframe.
    *   **D: Kolamuka komela mai na molangi pembeni ya mbeto nayo** (Waking up and drinking water from a bottle next to your bed): This doesn't necessarily break the sleep cycle like the need to get up and go to the bathroom would.

Therefore, option B is the only one that fits the description of an action likely to facilitate ""kokata pongi"" as explained in the passage."
Nini na mae malandi ekokani te na bolimboli ya kokata pongi?,"The correct answer is **D: Sima ya kolamuka litomba ezali ya kolala lisusu sima ya bangonga mibale to deux heures du temps**.

Here's why:

*   The definition of ""kokata pongi"" in the passage describes waking up for a short period (10-60 minutes) and then going back to sleep. Option D says you sleep after two hours, which is too long.

Let's look at why the other options are more aligned with the passage:

*   **A: Ekoki kolandana na biorhythme:** The passage mentions ""biorythme"" as a factor in methods related to waking up for the process.
*   **B: Litomba ezali ya komilamusa yomoko mobimba:** The passage says using a quiet alarm helps you *avoid* waking up completely. However, you still wake up partially. So, it is still similar.
*   **C: Esalemaka na ngonga nayo ya kolala mikolo nyonso:** The passage does not say that it happens every day. So the response does not directly align with the passage. However, as a routine sleep cycle, it can happen every day. So, it is similar.

**Therefore, option D is the only one that contradicts the information presented in the passage.**"
"Na tango boongo ezali komeka kozua ba ndoto ya malamu mingi mingi, nini ebakisamaka?","The correct answer is **A: Ba REM**.

The passage states: ""Ntina monene oyo likambo wana esalemaka ezali bandolo ya solo oyo ebakisaka molai ya ngonga kati na REM"" which translates to ""The main reason this happens is because of the true cycles that increase the duration of time in REM.""
"
Kozala na ba ndoto ya malamu ebele ekoki kosala nini na nzoto?,"The correct answer is **B: Kokitisa ba REM butu moko na moko**.

Here's why:

The passage states that multiple vivid dreams increase the length of REM sleep. However, because there are fewer REM periods during the night, the periods of deep, restful sleep become shorter and less effective. This implies that the *number* of REM periods is reduced, even though their *length* may be increased. Therefore, multiple vivid dreams reduce the REM periods in a night.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, ekipe ya komonana na ekipe ya komonana te ekokani lolenge nini?","The correct answer is **A: Nyonso mibale esengeli kosala mosala lolenge moko**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Baekipe oyo emonanaka te bazalaka na mbeko ya kosala malamu ya ndenge moko neti ba ekipe nyonso"" (Virtual teams have the same responsibility to perform well as any team).
* This clearly means they need to perform the same type of work, even if they are virtual.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nyonso mibale ezali na lolenge na yango kosala misala ya mokolo na mokolo** - While implied, the passage's core comparison is about the responsibility to do similar work, not specifically how they structure their day-to-day tasks. The virtual teams have a freedom to set there on scedual.
*   **C: Nyonso mibale bapesaka raport na lisanga ya bakambi moko oyo emonanaka te** - The passage states virtual teams are those whose members report up into a management team, but makes no such claim about traditional teams
*   **D: Nyonso mibale esalaka na ngonga moko**- The passage says that they can work in various ours depending on the managment."
"Kolanda malaoba wana, maloba nini ezali ya solo te na mae matali ekipe yakomonana te na ya komonana?","The correct answer is **A: Baekipe ya komonana ezuamaka na litomba mingi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on characteristics of remote/virtual teams and contrasts them with traditional (visible) teams.** It *doesn't* explicitly state or imply that visible teams are inherently more beneficial. It just points out differences.
* **B: Baekipe ya mosika ezuamaka lokola esika ya bokutani pona baekipe ya komonana** - While not directly stated, it's *implied* that remote teams can *facilitate* connections within visible teams, as the passage mentions they help integrate their visible team members. This doesn't necessarily mean they *are* a meeting place, but it's closer to the passage's meaning.
* **C: Baekipe ya komonana ezalaka na lolenge ya kosala yango moko mukie oyo ekokani te na balisanga ya mosika** - The passage states ""...there are some small differences."" This supports this statement.
* **D: Mbongwana ya bangonga ekoki kozala malamu pona baekipe ya komonana te** - The passage says that visible teams may have schedules that can be monitored, implying more rigidity than remote teams.

Therefore, only **A** makes a statement that cannot be confirmed within the text.
"
Nini na mae malandi ezali te eloko oyo mateya ya bolukiluki etalelaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Bamposa ya sika oyo ekokisamaka na kimokolo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on:**
    * Factors that influence motivation and pleasure.
    * Internal needs and desires that develop over time.
    * External factors and environments that influence behavior.
    * Established theories like Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.

* **Option A, ""Bamposa ya sika oyo ekokisamaka na kimokolo"" (New needs that are satisfied in adulthood),** while potentially related to overall human development, is **not explicitly the focus** of the research described in the passage. The passage emphasizes pre-existing needs that have manifested over time, so new needs aren't the focus.

The other options are directly addressed:

*   **B: Lolenge nini esika ya kofanda ebongolaka bizaleli ya moto (How environment changes behavior)** - The text mentions that the environment can push someone to act or not act.
*   **C: Bamposa ya kati (Internal needs)** - The text references internal needs
*   **D: Kososola oyo bato balingaka (Understanding desires)** - The text mentions that it tries to explain what pushes someone to do something or makes them happy.

Therefore, the only answer that isn't addressed is A.

"Kolanda maloba wana, lolenge basali bazali komatisa qualite yakosala ba camera digital, lolenge nini zoom ekomi malamu?","The correct answer is **C: Bafoto nabango ekokani na botalatala ya point focal fixe** (Their photos are comparable to those of a fixed focal point lens).

The passage states that zoom lenses are becoming better because they are ""helping camera zooms to take better photos that are comparable to the photos taken by non-movable zooms."" This directly corresponds to option C. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text. The passage lists drawbacks of zoom lenses that the manufacturers are working to improve.

Na mae malandi nini ekoki te kozala bolimboli ya solo ya Mysticisme?,"The correct answer is **D: Molende pona koluka experience personel ekokani na bondimi misusu ebele mpe lolenge ya kobondela.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that mysticism can *differ* from other religions and worship practices in its approach to personal experience. Option D claims that the pursuit of personal experience *aligns* with other religions, which contradicts the text.

Options A, B, and C all align with the description of mysticism in the passage.
"

"Kolanada maloba wana, lnani akokaki kobanda lisanga ya baloni bilanga?","Answer: C: Bato ya Maori kouta Polynesie
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, lisanga oyo ebundisaki Bamaos bazalaki bato ya yambo kobika na esika nini ?","The correct answer is **C: The Chatham Islands**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ezalaki na ekolo mosusu na bisanga ya Chatham, ezalaki ba Maori oyo bayaki wana longwa na Nouvelle-Zelande. Bamibengaka bango moko ba Moriori po ezalaki na mwa bitumba kuna kasi na suka, basilisaki ba Moriori.""

This translates to: ""On the Chatham Islands, there were Maori who came from New Zealand. They called themselves Moriori and there were some fights there, but in the end, they destroyed the Moriori.""

Therefore, the group that fought the (original) Moriori lived on the Chatham Islands."

"
"Kolanda maloba wana, esika nini oyo elandani te na civilization Indus Valley ?","The correct answer is **B: The Sarasvati River**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that some scholars *think* the civilization should be called the Indus-Sarasvati civilization because it was also near the now-dry Sarasvati River, but this is presented as an alternate, and not universally accepted, name.
*   The other options are all mentioned as definite parts of the Indus Valley Civilization: Harappa (as the first excavated site), northern Afghanistan, and most of modern-day Pakistan."
Kombo nini oyo ekoki te kozala kombo ya Civilization ya Mbula ya Bronze lolenge elobami na maloba wana,"Based on the passage, here's why the answer is:

*   **Correct Answer:** **A: The Harappan Civilization**

*   **Explanation:**

    *   The passage explicitly states that the Harappan Civilization IS a name used for this Bronze Age society. Therefore, it is NOT a name that *cannot* be used.
    *   The other options are names that are, at least to some degree, debated or alternative names for the same civilization."
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi epesaka litomba ya ngonga molai?","The correct answer is **A: Koyokana na basusu**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Lokoso na moimi ekozalaka ntango nioso elongo na biso pe boyokani eza ete ntango bato mingi bazweli yango matomba ekozala na makambo mingi ya kozwa nsima ya ntango mokie soki toza na moimi. Nazolikia, bato mingi bakoyeba ete liponi na bango ya malamu ya ntango molai eza ya kosala elongo na basusu.""

This translates to: ""Greed and selfishness are always with us, and the agreement is that when many people benefit from it, there will be more to gain in the long run if we are selfish. I hope, many people will realize that their best long-term choice is to work together with others.""

Therefore, based on P, the long-term benefit is gained through **cooperation (koyokana na basusu)**.  The passage directly contrasts cooperation with selfishness, implying cooperation is the better long-term strategy.

"Kolanda maloba wana, nani afutaki mbongo ebele ya Bitumba?","The correct answer is **D: Bato ya Mboka Phillipines**.

The passage states directly that the Philippine people were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. government to cover the costs of the war.
"
Tango nini eyaki liboso ya mbula Templiers?,"The correct answer is **C: Bileko ya moyen age ya kati**.

The passage states that the Templars were formed during the High Middle Ages (Moyen Age ya Likolo), which took place in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries.  It also says the High Middle Ages came *after* the Early Middle Ages (Moyen Age ya se). Therefore, the Early Middle Ages came *before* the time of the Templars. ""Bileko ya moyen age ya kati"" is the best translation of the Early Middle Ages.
"
Tango nini nde eyaki yambo sima ya mbula ya baTempliers?,"The correct answer is **C: Bileko ya moyen age ya likolo**.

The passage states that the period when the Templars were active is often called the High Middle Ages. The question asks what came *before* the period of the Templars. So the answer is the High Middle Ages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bileko ya suka ya moyen age:** The passage says the High Middle Ages came *before* the Late Middle Ages, not after the Templar period.
*   **B: Ekeke to siecle ya 12:** While the Templars were active in the 12th century, the question asks about the period *before* their time, not just a specific century within their era.
*   **D: Ekeke ya 11:** Similar to option B, the 11th century falls within the High Middle Ages, but the question is asking for the period name before the time of the Templars.
"
Lolenge nini ya kobikisa to lolenge ya minganga kosala oyo elobami te kosalema na minganga na tango ya Kibokonzi ya Roma?,"The correct answer is **A: Kopesa bato kisi pona kozanga kimia koleka na nzela ya bakisi Sedative**.

The text mentions using morphine and scopolamine as anesthetics and pain relievers, but it *doesn't* talk about using sedatives to treat anxiety or other psychological conditions. The text focuses on surgical techniques and pain management. The other options are explicitly mentioned in the text.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini elobami te kozala na kati ya makambo ya bokolisi ya kimonganga oyo esalemaki na tango ya Bokonzi ya Baroma ?","The correct answer is **C: Lolenge ya kozala ya balopitalo pona koyekola**.

The text mentions the following:

*   **A: Lolenge ya kozala ya lisanga ya baminganga:** The text says ""Mokonzi Auguste abandaki kozwa minganga mpe kutu asalaki etuluku ya liboso ya minganga ya Roma mpona basalela bango nsima ya bitumba."" (Emperor Augustus started to hire doctors and even created the first group of Roman doctors to serve after battles). This indicates the existence of a medical corps or group of doctors.
*   **B: Matta ya Basoda ya Bokonzi wana:** The text clearly connects medical advancements to the military focus of the Roman Empire, with doctors serving soldiers after battles.
*   **D: Lolenge Mokonzi azalaki kotiya minganga na mosala:** The text says that Emperor Augustus began employing doctors, demonstrating how the Emperor was involved in the deployment of medical professionals.

The text does **NOT** mention hospitals used for teaching or learning purposes. It focuses on the use of medicine and surgery to treat soldiers. Therefore, option C is the answer."
Makoki pona komona etali eloko nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Biteni ya nzoto oyo esungaka emoneli**

The passage clearly states that the ability to see ""etalelaka bianama ya komona to miso"" which translates to ""depends on visual organs or eyes"". This means the ability to see is related to the parts of the body that support vision.
"
Mbongwana na biteni ya miso na kati ya baoraganismes ya nzoto etalelaka nini?,"The best answer is **B: Bosengi ya Nzoto to organismes**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how eye structures vary based on an organism's needs.**  It states, ""Bandako ekeseni eza na makoki ya kokesena, ezolandela bokeseni ya molai ya ba onde pe eza na ba degre ekeseni, lisusu ezosenga mayele mosusu to ezala malamu pe ezosenga mintango ekeseni po esala malamu"" which means ""Different structures have different capabilities, depending on the length of the waves and at different degrees, in addition needing other skills or being good and needing different amounts to work well."" This directly links the variations in eye structure to the demands or requirements of the organism.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kimolai ya koyokela baondes (Wave Length Acuity):** While the passage mentions wave length, it's not the *primary* driver of eye structure variation. It's a factor, but the overall needs of the organism are more important.
* **C: Nivo to kimolai ya acuity (Level of Acuity):** Acuity (sharpness of vision) is a result of the eye structure, not the cause of its variation.  The *need* for a certain level of acuity is driven by the organism's requirements.
* **D: Mikakatano ya Nzoto (Body Challenges):** While environmental challenges can influence the evolution of body structures, the text itself emphasizes the functional demands of the organism, not just the general challenges it faces.

Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer because the passage emphasizes how eye structures are adapted to meet the specific visual needs of different organisms.

"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ezali lokola eloko ya motuya mingi na lingomba ya Sikhisme ?","A: Liteya ya Guru 

Explanation:

The passage states: ""Guru eza likambo ya ntina mingi mpona bangomba nyonso ya Inde kasi na Sikhisme eza ndimbola oyo esala ete ezala moboko ya bindimeli na bango."" This directly indicates that the teachings of the Guru are fundamental to Sikhism.

"Kolanda maloba wana, bana oyo bazali na bokono ya kozanga kotia likebi bazalaka na mikakatano pona kotiya likebi na nini?","The correct answer is **A: Misala ya kelasi**.

The text says: ""Bana oyo babelaka TDA bakokaka te kotia makanisi esika moko na makambo neti misala ya kelasi..."" which means ""Children who suffer from ADD cannot focus on things like schoolwork...""
"
"Kolanada maloba wana, pona nini bana ya Maladi ya kozanga kotia likebi balingaka kozala na bizaleli ya makama?","The correct answer is **D: Kolamusa Boongo nabango** (To stimulate their brains).

This directly explains that children with ADD seek out trouble to stimulate their brains because they have difficulty regulating brain function.

"Kolanda maloba wana, eteni nini ya Myspace ekoki kosalisa moyekoli oyo azali na mikakatano pona kotanga?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Customization**.

The text mentions:

*   ""Ekoki kozala bongisa yango mpo eza pete na kotanga mpe ekoki kozala na couleur mingi to moke ndenge olingi."" This translates to ""It can be adjusted so that it is easy to read and can have more or less color as you like.""

This directly relates to **customization** and how it can help a student with reading difficulties. The other options, blogs, one web address, and the number of profiles, are not directly related to improving readability."

Na mae malandi nini ezalaki te kati ya bantina ya botomboki na Mboka Pologne?,"The correct answer is **D: Kotiyama ya Wladyslaw Gomulka**.

The passage states that the protests *led* to Gomulka being appointed Prime Minister. His appointment was a consequence of the unrest, not a cause of it. The other options (A, B, and C) are all explicitly mentioned in the passage as contributing factors to the riots.

"
Na mae malandi nini elimboli malamu te litomba ya kotinda basango na bansinga ya boongo na nzoto?,"The correct answer is **A: Kosala makila etambola malembe**.

Here's why:

* **P says:** Boongo na biso ebatelaka homéostasie ndenge etindaka basango na bansinga ya boongo na nzoto mpona makila ekoba kotambola **pe etambola malamu**. This translates to: ""Our brain maintains homeostasis by sending signals through nerves to the body so that blood continues to circulate **and circulate well/properly**.""

* The passage emphasizes the brain's role in ensuring *proper* blood circulation.  Slowing down blood circulation would be the opposite of ""proper"" and would disrupt homeostasis.

Let's look at the other options:

* **B: Kotalela etamboli ya makila** (Monitoring blood circulation) - This aligns with the passage's point that the brain helps manage blood flow.
* **C: Kobatela bahoméostasie** (Maintaining homeostasis) - This is the central idea of the passage.
* **D: Kokebisa makama na nzoto** (Warning about dangers to the body) - The passage mentions that the rapid signals help protect the body from harm, which is related to detecting and reacting to dangers.

Therefore, slowing down blood circulation is the *opposite* of the benefit described in the passage.
"
Nini ekoki kozuama na Plateau ya Giza?,"The correct answer is **D: Piramid ya munene koleka**

Here's why:

*   **P** specifies that the Plateau ya Giza contains ""bapiramide mingi (piramide monene eleki nyonso na monene), bankunda mingi ya mike, batempelo mingi, mpe Sphinx monene.""
*   A,B are found, but the query is what *can* be found
*   C is true, but piramid ya monene koleka is also true.
*   D is explicitly mentioned as being on the Plateau of Giza, and the question asks what *can* be found there."
Litomba ya Pyramide ya munene koleka ezalaki nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Kokumisa Faraon (To honor the Pharaoh)**

The passage states: ""Piramide monene basalaki yango mpona kokumisa Farao Khufu..."" (The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu...). Therefore, the primary purpose was to honor the Pharaoh.
"
Nani asalaki mayele nabiso ya Arson oyo ebebisaki tempelo?,"The correct answer is **B: Alexander the Great**.

The passage says it was Herostratus who burned the Temple of Artemis.
"
Maloba nini ezali ya solo na mae matali botongi lisusu ya lingomba ya Artemis?,"The correct answer is **B: Etongamaki lisusu sima ya bokonzi ya Alexander the Great.**

Here's why:

*   The text states that Alexander offered to fund the rebuilding, but the offer was refused.
*   The text indicates that the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC, after Alexander's death. This is why option B is the only correct one.
*   Herostratus was the one who burned down the temple, so option C is incorrect.
*   The date mentioned in option D is incorrect because the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC."
"Kolanda maloba wana, tango nini ezalaki nokinoki mingi oyo bikelamu bakokaki kotambola na makolo mibale?","The text mentions fossils of *Australopithecus* that date back to 4.2-3.9 million years ago as being bipedal.  The *Sahelanthropus* is mentioned as potentially bipedal even earlier (7 million years ago), but the question asks for *definite* bipedalism.

Therefore, the earliest *definite* instance of bipedalism mentioned is 4.2 million years ago. The correct answer is:

**D: Bambula 4.2 milion eleki**
"
Na Bikelamu oyo nani abandaki kotambola na makolo mibale na ngonga nyonso?,"The correct answer is **A: Sahelanthropus**.

The passage states: ""atako Sahelanthropus atambolaki na makolo mibale mibu bamilio nsambo esi eleki."" (although Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago). This directly indicates Sahelanthropus was the earliest mentioned in the passage to walk bipedally.

"Kolanda bansango oyo epesami na maloba wana, nani alongaki makasi na etumba ya mai na Campagne ya Atlantique ya nordi?","The passage says that the Americans were trying to send supplies to Great Britain and that German U-boats were trying to stop them. It also states that if the Allies *failed*, Germany would conquer Great Britain. This implies that the Allies (including the British and Americans) *did* succeed.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Ba Britanique na Ba Ameriken**
"
Na tango ba Asyriens babandaki kosalela Calvary nini ezalaki naino te na tango wana?,"The text states, ""Lokola basalaki naino te esika ya kofandela, basoda ya Assirie oyo babundaki likolo ya mpunda bafandaki kaka boye likolo ya bampunda na bitumba."" This means saddles had not yet been invented.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: Bifandelo likolo ya punda
"
Bitumba oyo esalelaka ba cavaliers ebundanaka lolenge nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Likolo ya punda** (On horseback).

The text clearly states: ""Cavalier eza soda oyo abundaka likolo ya mpunda."" (A cavalier is a soldier who fights on horseback.)

"
Na mae malandi nini oyo ezalaki kaka pona batumbi mbeka,"The correct answer is **B: Etumbelo ya kati**.

Here's why:

* **Etumbelo ya kati (Sanctuary/Inner Shrine):** The text says only priests could enter the inner shrine. Since sacrifices were performed for the gods, and priests had access to the most sacred space where the gods were honored, this is where sacrifices likely took place.
* The text doesn't specifically mention any of the other options being exclusively for sacrifice.
"
Na tango nini Mokonzi Tutankhamun azuaki lokumu mpe koyebana ?,"The correct answer is **C: Sima ya komona lilita naye**.

The passage clearly states that Tutankhamun became famous due to the discovery of his tomb in 1922. The passage also explicitly states that he was not considered important in ancient times and was not included in most lists of ancient kings.
"
Nini esalaki ete Mokonzi Tutankhamun akoma mokonzi ya Egypte oyo ayebani?,"The correct answer is **A: Komonana ya lilita naye oyo bayibaki te** (The discovery of his unlooted tomb).

"
Eloko nini poete ya mboka Grece Homer akokaki te?,"The correct answer is **B: Komona (To see)**

The text states that Homer was a ""poete oyo akufa miso"" which means ""a poet who was blind"". Therefore, Homer could not see.
"
Moto nini kouta Grece oyo ayebani makasi libanda ya mosala ya kokoma?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagorus**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that Pythagorus is a mathematician known for his ideas about right triangles, which falls outside the realm of writing.
*   The other options, Homer, Sophocles, and Aristophanes, are all mentioned as writers or playwrights."
Esika nini libota ya Ba Ebele elekisaki ngonga mingi?,"The correct answer is **A: Na Libanda** (Outside).

The passage clearly states: ""Mabota ebele ya Baebele bazalaki kolekisa bomoi na bango na libanda"" (Many Hebrew families spent their lives outside).
"
Nini oyo ezalaki ya litomba mingi te pona libota ya ba Ebele ?,"Based on the passage, the answer is **C: Ba ndako nabango**.

The passage states: ""Na climat ya moto ya Moyen-Orient, ndako ezalaki te ntina mingi."" (In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not very important). This directly implies that houses were not of great benefit to Hebrew families.

*   **A: Istware ya moko na moko (History)**: ""...lisolo na kati Danemark, Suède, Norvège pe Islande""
*   **C: Kibokoko (Rulers/Governance)**: ""...bakonzi...""
*   **D: Bato (People)**: ""...bokeseni mingi na bato...""

It does **not** explicitly mention differences in **Mabele (Land/Geography)**. The focus is on cultural, political, and historical differences, not geographical ones."
Nani efandaki na Greenland yambo?,"The correct answer is **A: Bikolo ya ba eskimo**.

The passage states: ""Kasi, atako makambo nyonso oyo amonaki, bikolo ya baEskimo bazalaki kofanda kuna na ntango wana."" (But, despite all that he saw, Eskimo peoples were already living there at that time.)
"
Lisanga nini ekoki kolinga koliya ya kotelema kozanga bakiti te?,"The correct answer is **C: Mibali ya bozui ya Roma**.

The passage states that ""mibali ya bozwi basepelaka kosala feti elongo bamifandelaka mpe bazolia bilei na bango."" This means that wealthy Roman men liked to recline and eat their food at feasts. Reclining implies eating in a position other than sitting in chairs or standing.
"
Na Mae malandi nini ekoki kozala te kati ya feti ya Roma ya kala?,"The correct answer is **D: Saani ya dendo yakotumba** (Roasted turkey dish).

The passage states clearly that ""moto moko te ya Roma ya kala amekaki dindon"" (no one in ancient Rome tasted turkey). Therefore, a roasted turkey dish could not have been present at an ancient Roman feast.

Let's look at why the other options are possible:

*   **A: Bapaya babola koliya na bakiti** (Poor people eating on chairs): The passage says that the poor *women* ate sitting on chairs.
*   **B: Koliya bambembe pona apeti** (Eating squabs for appetizers): The passage mentions doves as a possible feast dish.
*   **C: Mibali ya bozui kolala nase na ngonga ya koliya** (Rich men reclining while eating): The passage states that rich men ""bamifandelaka mpe bazolia bilei na bango"" (reclined and ate their food)."
"Kolanda maloba wana, kati ya mae malandi nini ekoki kozala na litomba ya molai te?","The correct answer is **B: Libula ya mukie (Small heritage)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of large-scale societies and shared, lasting legacies for civilization.** It states that a defining characteristic of a civilization is passing down knowledge through many generations, a legacy that endures.
* **""Libula ya mukie"" (Small heritage)** by definition would not have a lasting or broad impact, so it would likely not qualify as a key element of civilization as described in the passage.
* The other options all have the potential to contribute to a lasting legacy.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini eyaka yambo ya ekolo?","The correct answer is **C: Engumba ya munene**.

The passage states: ""Bingumba oyo eza bamboka esalema liboso ya bikolo."" which translates to ""Cities are the countries that were created before nations.""
"
Maloba nini na mae matali The Drukgyal Dzong ezali ya solo te?,"The incorrect statement about Drukgyal Dzong is **A: Etongamaki pona kosepela bolongi etumba ya mapinaga ya basoda ya Tibetan-Mongol**

While the passage states it was built to commemorate the victory over the Tibetan-Mongol forces, the phrase ""kosepela bolongi etumba ya mapinaga"" translates to ""to celebrate the victory party"". This implies a celebratory festival or event, which is not what the passage describes. It was built as a fortress to *commemorate* the victory, not to hold a party. Therefore, statement A is an inaccurate interpretation of the text."
Maloba nini elimboli malamu litomba ya moto na Drukgyal Dzong?,"Mbala moko, maloba oyo eleki malamu mpo na koloba litomba ya moto na Drukgyal Dzong ezali:

**A: Eloko moko kaka etikalaki ezali foto ya Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal**

Entreprise ya Inde Dutch Est esalaki nini te na tango nabango na Taiwan?,"Eyano ya malamu ezali **D: Kondima kopesa boyangeli ya Taiwan na Mokonzi Qing**.

Baparagrafe emonisi ete *boyangeli ya Qing* nde epesaki maboko ya Taiwan na Japon na boyokani ya Shimonoseki, kasi te entreprise ya Inde Dutch Est. Babandi ya Inde Dutch Est basalaki nde makambo misusu nyonso oyo etangami (A, B, mpe C).
"
Boyokani ya Shimonoseki esalaki nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Kibonkozi ya Japon likolo na Taiwan**.

The passage clearly states ""Na 1895, ntango bato ya Chine na bato ya Japon babelaki na mbala ya liboso na bitumba (1894-1895), boyangeli ya Qing esalaki boyokani na Shimonoseki, bandimaki kopesa boyangeli ya Taiwan na maboko ya Japon"".  This confirms that the Treaty of Shimonoseki resulted in Japan gaining control over Taiwan.
"
Nivo ya pH ya Chimi etalemaka lolenge nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Ba Hydrogenes boni ezali kati na ba ions chimique**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Balakisi nivo ya pH na motango ya baions ya hydrogène (H na pH) na eloko ya chimie oyo bamekaki."" This directly translates to ""pH indicators measure the quantity of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lolenge nini acid ezali pete to chimic (How acidic or chemical a thing is):** While pH *relates* to acidity/alkalinity, it is measured by the amount of hydrogene ions so this is not the definition for pH.
* **B: Baprotons boni ezali na kati ya Chimi (How many protons are in the chemical):** While related, pH measures the *concentration of hydrogen ions* (which are essentially protons), not the total number of protons.
* **D: Baelectrons boni ezali na kati ya chimie (How many electrons are in the chemical):** Electrons aren't the direct measurement of pH. The passage even explains that hydrogen ions are hydrogen atoms *without* their electron.
"
Nini elongolamaki na kati ya baions Hydrogene?,"The correct answer is **D: BaElectrons**.

The text states: ""Baions ya hydrogène eza baprotons oyo balongola baélectrons"". This translates to ""Hydrogen ions are protons that have had electrons removed.""
"
Maloba nini na mae malandi elimboli malamu te Lolendo ya Nkosi?,"The best answer is **C: Mibali na basi bango nyonso bayokanaka malamu**

Here's why:

*   The text states that female lions (basi) have strong bonds, often being related as sisters and daughters. It does *not* say that males and females have equally strong bonds or that *everyone* gets along well. The mention of males often fighting each other for dominance hints at the opposite.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Bazalaka na bizaleli ndenge moko na etuluku ya bambwa:** This is supported by the text; it explicitly compares lion hunting strategies to those of wild dogs.
*   **B: Botangi ya mibali na ya basi ekokani te:** This is supported by the text, which mentions two to three males and up to thirty females and cubs.
*   **D: Bango nyonso bakoki koboma mpe bayebi kofanda na basusu:** This is supported by the text, which mentions how lions hunt to survive and also how they like to live with others.

Therefore, **C** is the option that is not accurately reflected in the passage."
Na mae malandi maloba nini elimboli malamu te ezaleli ya bankosi?,"The correct answer is **D: Bazali na bizaleli ekokana na baniau ya minene misusu**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Bayebi kofanda na basusu malamu** - This is true. The passage states: ""Bankosi eza baniau oyo eyebi kofanda na basusu..."" (Lions are animals that know how to live with others).
*   **B: Bizaleli na bango ekokani na ya ba mbwa ya zamba** - This is true. The passage states: ""Bankosi basalaka makambo neti bambwa ya zamba..."" (Lions act like wild dogs).
*   **C: Bango nyonso mibali na basi bakoki koboma makasi pona koluka bilei** - This is also true. The passage states: ""...mpe ebomaka makasi mpona biloko ezoluka kokanga"" (...and they hunt aggressively for the things they want to catch).

*   **D: Bazali na bizaleli ekokana na baniau ya minene misusu** - This is **FALSE**. The passage specifically says that lions' behaviors are surprisingly similar to wild dogs, *but not to other large cats*.
"
Balapins balukamaka lokola bilei mbala ebele pona nani?,"According to the provided text, animals of a larger size eat smaller animals such as rats, antelope, and sheep. In general, there are many small animals (including domestic animals) that eat many small things, such as ants, rodents, insects, and birds.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Baniau ya minene** (Large animals).

Balapins are preyed upon by large animals."
Baniau ya mike mikie mbala ebele elukaka bilei nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Barongeurs**

The passage states: ""eza na baniau mingi ya mike (ata baniau oyo babokolaka) oyo eliaka biloko mingi ya mike, na ndakisa bafourmis, barongeurs, miselekete, mpe bandeke."" This translates to ""there are many small animals (even domesticated animals) that eat very small things, such as ants, rodents, insects, and birds."" Of the options provided, ""rongeurs"" (rodents) is one of the things that small animals eat.
"
Na Mae malandi nini ezali te na bizaleli ya BaOcelot na lolenge naye yakoluka bilei?,"Eyano ya malamu ezali:

**A: Kobima libanda ya esika nabango ya kobatama**

D: Lisolo elobi ete Banyama nyonso oyo ocelot akangaka ezalaka moke koleka ye. Yango ezali solo
"
Na mae malandi nini elimboli Ocelot malamu te? ,"The correct answer is **C: Makoki nabango ya koyoka solo ezali nase**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bato ya siansi bakanisaka ete baocelots balandaka pe bakangaka banyama ya kolia (mbisi) na solo, babendaka zolo mpona koyeba esika bazalaki na mabele."" This means ocelots *do* rely on their sense of smell to hunt. Therefore, a low sense of smell would *not* describe them well.

The other options *do* describe ocelots well, according to the passage:

* **A: Bakoki koluka bilei malamu mingi na butu** (They can hunt well at night): The passage says they ""komona malamu mpenza na molili mpo bamonaka na butu"" (see very well in the dark because they see at night).
* **B: Batambolaka nokinoki** (They walk quickly): The passage states they ""batambolaka mpe na mayele"" (they walk skillfully), implying agility. While ""nokinoki"" means fast/quickly, this would mean it is skilled to move.
* **D: Balingaka koluka banyama ya mikie** (They like to hunt small animals): The first sentence states ""BaOcelot balingaka kolia banyama ya mike"" (Ocelots like to eat small animals).

Therefore, only option C contradicts the information given in the passage.
"
Na mae malandi nini ekoki te kozala eloko ya makasi koleka na bizaleli ya Tigre?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Komata na esika**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that tigers are good athletes and can climb, but specifically notes that they ""climb *kasi malamu te*"" which means they climb, but not well.
*   The text explicitly mentions that tigers can jump high, swim, and pull with the strength of five men.
*   The text describes the tiger's roar.

Therefore, climbing is the activity the tiger is least proficient at according to the text."
"Kolanda maloba wana, bokeseni ya Tigre na Nkosi ezali nini na mae malandi?","The correct answer is **B: Mongongo ya kolela nabango** (Their roar)

The passage states:

*   ""Konguluma ya tigre ezalaka te ya mongongo makasi neti ya nkosi"" (The roar of a tiger is not as loud as a lion's)

This directly highlights a difference in their roars. The other options are not specifically mentioned as differences in the text.

Ebandeli ya Kombo “cell” to selile elobi nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Chambre ya mukie**.

The text says ""Selile euta na liloba ya Kilatini cella oyo elimboli chambre ya moke."" (The cell comes from the Latin word cella which means small chamber.)
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, banyama mingi bazali na makoki ya kosala nini?","The correct answer is **B: Kolongwa esika to kotambola**.

The paragraph states: ""Banyama mingi etambolaka."" This translates to ""Many animals move."" While the paragraph also mentions digging, swimming, and flying, it *specifically* says that many animals move/walk, making it the most accurate answer to the question.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, banyama misusu bazangaka eloko nini?","The correct answer is **C: Boongo**

The text states: ""Banyama pamba eza na boongo (atako banyama nyonso te nde baza na yango; na ndakisa, méduse, eza te na boongo)."" This clearly indicates that some animals lack a brain. The other options are incorrect because the text indicates that all animals have cells and the ability to digest food.
"
Nini esungaka banzete na tango ya Photosynthesis?,"The correct answer is **D: Moi** (Sun).

The passage states: ""Banzete esalaka bilei na yango na moi na nzela ya ebongiseli babengi photosynthese."" (Trees make their food with the sun through a process called photosynthesis).
"
Eloko nini bato babimisaka oyo banzete ezuaka?,"The correct answer is **D: Carbone dioxide**

The passage states: ""Banzete esalaka mopepe oyo bato bapemaka, pe ezwaka dioxide ya carbone oyo bato babimisaka (elingi koloba kofula)."" This directly translates to: ""Trees produce the air that people breathe and take carbon dioxide that people exhale (which is to say, carbon/smoke).""

"
Eteni nini ya system ya circulation oyo ememaka makila na motema?,"Correct answer: D: Misisa (Ba veines)

The question asks which part of the circulatory system carries blood *to* the heart. The passage states that veins (ba veines/misisa) carry blood *back* to the heart.
"
Batiyo nini ezalaka ya mukie makasi na system ya circulation?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba Capillaires**.

The text states: ""Batiyo ya mike babengaka yango ba capillaires."" which translates to ""The small vessels are called capillaries.""
"
Makoki ya nyama ya mukie emataka na lolenge nini pona kokanga mapapu naye kozongisa sima?,"The correct answer is **B: Bisika ya kobatama**.

The text states: ""Banyama mingi ya mike eza na makoki ya kokanga mapapu na bango elongo na nzoto na bango. Yango esalaka ete bazala na bisika ebele ya mike ya kobombana na bato oyo bazoluka koboma bango.""

This clearly indicates that the ability to fold wings helps them to find places to hide.

Na mae matali makoki ya banyama ya mikie kopunmbwa nini epatami te na mae malandi oyo ekoki kozala affecter na makoki ya nyama ya mukie kopunbwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Molai ya bomoi (Lifespan)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Kobotama (Reproduction):** The passage discusses finding mates, which is directly related to reproduction.
*   **C: Kokutanisa bilei (Foraging):** The passage mentions finding food, which is directly related to foraging.
*   **D: Kosala musala malamu (Performance):** The passage mentions escaping predators, which is directly related to performance.
*   **B: Molai ya bomoi (Lifespan):** The passage doesn't directly address how the ability to fly or the mechanics of flight affect a bug's lifespan. While flight might indirectly affect lifespan by improving access to food or escape from predators, it's not explicitly mentioned as a direct consequence in the passage.

Therefore, lifespan is the option least directly related to the flying abilities of insects as described in the provided text."

Kilometre carrer boni ya mboka Turquie ezali na Erope?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The passage states: ""23 764 kilomètres carrés (9174 miles carrés) na Eropa"".
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, kimolai ya Turquie ezali boni?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The text states ""Territoire ya Turquie eza molai bakilometele koleka 1 600 (1 000 mi)"".  This directly gives the length as more than 1600 kilometers.
"
Lokota ya Latin esalemaka pona nini na Engumba Vatican?,"The correct answer is **A: Makambo ya Nzambe**.

The text specifically states that Latin is used ""mbala mingi na makambo ya Nzambe"" (mostly in matters of God).
"
"Na Engumba Vatican, lokota ya Itali esalemaka te pona ntina nini?","The correct answer is **C: Makambo ya Nzambe**.

The passage states that Latin is often used in matters of God, not Italian.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, kouta na bosangisi ya mingongo na ba ordinatere ya mindondomindondo nini ekoki kozua litomba?","The correct answer is **A: Miziki**.

The passage states that music recording is often done using computers to edit and mix sounds. Therefore, music directly benefits from the use of computers to mix sounds.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, ebeleya bandako ya esika nini emonanaki kozala na ba toilete ya mindele?","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

The text specifically mentions that the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had indoor plumbing systems for waste disposal, which is a characteristic of modern toilets. While the text mentions other places having waste systems, it's only Harappa and Mohenjo-daro that are described as having systems within homes.
"
Na Bisika elandi esika nini bipai ya malamu ya kobwaka mai ya mbindo emonanaki?,"All of the options listed are correct. The text mentions good wastewater disposal systems in:

*   **Harappa**
*   **Santorini**

*   **Chine**

Therefore, the best answer would be that **all of the above (A, B, C, and D) are correct.**
"
Na mae malandi nini esalaka patineur kobaluka?,"The passage clearly states that the curvature of the blade allows the skater to turn, and the tip of the blade that digs into the ice is what facilitates the turn.  Therefore, the best answer is:

**A: Suka ya Songe ya Razwar ya patineur** (The tip of the blade of the skater)
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi elimboli malamu libulu na kati ya razwar ya patin ya mikolo oyo?","The correct answer is **B: Esika ya kobaluka (Place to turn)**.

The text explicitly states that because the blade has a slight curve and the hollow within it allows the blade to tilt, the skater can engage the edge and turn. Therefore, the hollow is essential for turning.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, eteni nini esalaka ete Ba Atomes elongola nguya ya koleka ebele na mwinda?","The passage states: ""Basalaka yango na kobimisaka mwa ndambu ya pole babengi """"photon""""."" This indicates that atoms release photons to get rid of excess energy.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Baphotons**.
"
Nini etindaka atome kobimisa photon?,"The correct answer is **B: Kolendisa oyo etindamaka na mwinda ya makasi** (Stimulation prompted by intense light).

The passage explicitly states: ""Bato ya siansi babengaka metode wana 'kolendisa mpona kobimisa kongenga' po bapesaki atome moto na nzela ya pole makasi, esalaka ete ebimisisa pole ya photon..."". This translates to ""Scientists call this method 'stimulated emission' because they hit the atom with intense light, causing it to emit a photon..."" Therefore, the intense light is what prompts the atom to emit a photon.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ekoki kopekisa ampule kosala?","The correct answer is **C: Nsinga ya kati ya Ampule kozika**

The text specifically states ""nsima ya kosala bankama ya bangonga mingi, sukasuka nsinga ya ampule ezikaki mpe ampule ezalaki kosala lisusu te."" (After working for hundreds of hours, finally the filament of the bulb burned out and the bulb no longer worked.) This directly indicates that a burnt filament is the cause of the bulb failing.
"
Na mae malandi nini ekoki kozala likama makasi?,"The correct answer is **B: Esika ya kopelisa mwinda (Esika ya mwinda)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes the danger of electric shock from the socket (esika ya mwinda) if you touch it or the metal part of the bulb while the power is on. It warns about the danger of electrical current going through the socket. The rest of the options are parts that are less related to the immediate electrical shock hazard described in the passage."
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini esalemaka tango neutron ekabwani?","The correct answer is **B: Nguya ebimaka**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that splitting an atom releases some of the energy used to hold it together. This is the fundamental principle of fission.
*   Therefore, when a neutron splits an atom (as mentioned in the question), energy is released."

"
Nini esengeli koyebana na makambo oyo esalemaka mbala na mbala pona koyeba lolenge tango ezali kokende?,"The correct answer is **B: Repetition**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Okoki kotia yo moko bilembo na ndenge ntango ezoleka na kotanga ba *repetition* ya likambo moko oyo ezongaka."" This directly translates to: ""You can mark the passage of time by counting the *repetitions* of something that recurs.""
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, eteni nini ya likambo esalemaka pona kokokisa tango?","The correct answer is **B: Repetition**.

The text states: ""Okoki kotia yo moko bilembo na ndenge ntango ezoleka na kotanga ba repetition ya likambo moko oyo ezongaka."" (You can mark the passage of time by counting the repetitions of a recurring event.)

Therefore, according to the text, repetition is used to measure the passage of time.

**C: Bambula 600 eleki**
"
Lokota ya Estoni ezuaki bizaleli kouta wapi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ba Alphabets ya ba Alemands**.

The passage states: ""Eutaki na alfabe ya Allemagne pe elembo moko """"Õ/õ"""" ebakisamaki."" which translates to ""It came from the German alphabet and the sign """"Õ/õ"""" was added."" This clearly indicates that the Estonian language took characteristics from the German alphabet.

The correct answer is **B: Kombo ya solo ya alphabet ezalaki Hunan Jeongeum.**

**Reasoning:**

*   The passage states that the original name of the alphabet was ""Hunmin Jeongeum,"" not ""Hunan Jeongeum."" The other options are factually correct based on the information provided in the passage."
Alphabet Hunan Jeongeum ebongwanaki kokoma nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The passage states that ""Na ebandeli apesaki yango nkombo alfabe ya Hangeul Hunmin Jeongeum..."".  This tells us Hunmin Jeongeum was the original name for the Hangeul alphabet. Therefore, Hangeul is what Hunmin Jeongeum became.

"Kolanda maloba wana, liloba nini ezali ya solo pona Gravite ya Io?","Réponse oyo ebongi ezali **D: Gravite ya mabele ezali ebele pona yo koleka gravite ya Io**

Explanation:

The text states that you would weigh less on Io than on Earth because gravity pulls on you less.  This means Earth's gravity is stronger than Io's.  Options A, B, and C contradict this information.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, kati ya mae malandi nini elimboli malamu eteni ya libanda ya sanza?","The correct answer is **B: Croute ezali monene mingi na bangomba ya mikie**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Mabele ya makasi eza monene pene ya 70 km mopanzi ya pene mpe 100 km na mopanzi ya mosika...Eza moke mingi na nse ya maria mpe mwa monene na bangomba ya mike.""
*   This clearly indicates that the crust is thicker in mountainous regions (""bangomba ya mike"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Eteni ya pene mingi ezali na croute ya muke monene**: The passage says the crust is thin under the maria (plains), not in areas with a thin crust.
*   **C: Bamaria ekoki kozala mikie na mopanzi ya mosika**: The passage doesn't say that the maria are smaller on the far side, only that the crust is thicker there.
*   **D: Bamaria ekoki kozala mukie na bangomba ya mikie**: The passage states the opposite, that the crust is more thick in mountainous regions."
"Kolanda maloba wana, esika nini croute ya sanza ezali makasi koleka?","Esengeli tózwa eyano malamu kolanda maloba oyo :

*   Maloba elobi : ""Mabele ya makasi eza monene pene ya 70 km mopanzi ya pene mpe 100 km na mopanzi ya mosika."" Yango elakisi ete croûte eza monene koleka na mopanzi ya mosika.
*   Maloba elobi pe : ""Eza moke mingi na nse ya maria mpe mwa monene na bangomba ya mike."" Yango elakisi ete croûte eza moke na nse ya maria, kasi eza monene koleka na bangomba ya mike.

Kolanda ba informations oyo, totii na liste makasi ya croûte kolanda esika:

Yango wana, eyano ezali **A**."
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini endimami na bato?","The correct answer is **C: Bomoi ezali na ba planetes misusu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions people speculating about aliens and life on other planets:**  ""...basusu bakanisaka bapaya to bikelamu mosusu efandaka na planete mosusu."" (""...others think aliens or other beings live on other planets."")

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bato basili kosala mobenmbo na minzoto misusu (People have already traveled to other stars):** The passage states that people *dream* about this, implying it hasn't happened yet.
* **B: Bato bazali na makoki te ya kokende komona mikili misusu (People are not able to go to see other worlds):**  The passage suggests it might be possible in the distant future.
* **D: Katikati ya minzoto distance ezali nase ya ba kilometer trillion (The distance between stars is less than a trillion kilometers):** The passage states the opposite: ""Minzoto eza ya kopanzana mpenza kuna yango wana eza na bamiliare ya bakilometele oyo ekabolaka minzoto oyo ezalaka """"pembeni""""."" (""Stars are so spread out that there are billions of kilometers separating the ""nearby"" stars."") Trillion kilometers is far more then billions.
"
Nini ekomaka mukie mukie tango ozali kokende mosika na kati ya moi?,"The correct answer is **C: Gaz**

The passage states: ""Mopepe ekomaka moke mingi ntango ozopusana pene ya katikati ya moi"" which translates to ""The gas becomes very thin as you get closer to the center of the sun.""
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, eteni nini ya moi emonanaka kouta na mabele?","The correct answer is **C: Photosphere**.

The passage states: ""Eteni ya libanda oyo tomonaka ntango totalaka moi babengaka yango potosphere, oyo elimboli """"boule ya pole""""."" This directly translates to: ""The outer part that we see when we look at the sun is called the photosphere, which means 'ball of light'.""
"
Kati botali mae malandi fase nini esungaki kokokisa theory ya Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **A: Bafase ya Venus**.

The passage states that ""Bileko ya Vénus esimbaka mateya ya Copernic oyo elobaka ete baplanete ebalukaka zingazinga ya Moi."" (The phases of Venus support the Copernican theory that the planets revolve around the Sun.) Therefore, the observation of the phases of Venus was key in supporting Copernicus' theory.
"
Na mae malandi nini etalemaki na Galileo Galilei na mbula 1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Bafase ya Venus**.

The passage clearly states: ""na 1610, moto ya astronomie ya Italie Galileo Galilei asalelaki telescope mpona komona ete Venus eza na bafase"".
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Ebale ya Aazon etokaka mai kouta wapi?","The correct answer is **A: Ba ebale ya mikie** (Small rivers).

"

*   **B: Ezali Ebale ya munene koleka** (It is the largest River)
*   **C: Ezali ebale ya molai koleka** (It is the longest River)

Option C is also stated in the passage, though is not certain:  ""Amazom eza mpe ebale eleki monene na Mabele, ntango mosusu ezalaka molai bamiles motoba."" (The Amazon is also the longest river in the world, perhaps 6,000 miles long)

Therefore the correct answers are A, B, and C.
"
Mosala ya ndenge nini oyo elobelami na maloba wana ete epesaka talo mukie ya Bato ya Venezuela misala?,"The correct answer is **C: Essence**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that only ""moto moko na kati ya nkama moko"" (one in one hundred) Venezuelans work in the oil/essence industry. This indicates that a very small percentage of the population is employed in this sector, even though it's described as a significant industry for the country.
*   The passage states that ""moto moko na kati ya minei"" (one in four) Venezuelans work in the industry sector. This indicates that a small percentage of the population is employed in the industry sector, even though it's described as a significant industry for the country.
*   The passage states that ""moto moko na kati ya mitano"" (one in five) Venezuelans work in the agricultural sector. This indicates that a small percentage of the population is employed in the agricultural sector, even though it's described as a significant industry for the country.
*   The passage states that ""Bato mibale na kati ya bato misato ya Venezuela oyo basalaka, basalaka na misala ya biro"" (Two in three Venezuelans work in office jobs). This indicates that the largest percentage of the population is employed in office jobs.

"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na ba sectere nyonso oyo etangemi secter nini epesi ebele ya Bato ya Venezuela misala?","A: Mosala ya Biro

**Explanation**

The paragraph states:

*   Two out of three working Venezuelans work in office jobs.
*   One out of four work in industry.
*   One out of five work in agriculture.
*   One out of a hundred work in the oil industry.

Since two out of three is the largest proportion compared to the others, the office sector employs the most Venezuelans."
"Kolanda maloba wana, fusion esungaka minzoto kosala nini?","Eyano ya malamu ezali **C: Kopesa mwinda mpe molunge**.

"
Na mae malandi reacteur fusion ya litomba ekoki kosala nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Energy**.

The passage states that fusion reactors aim to produce energy (pole na molunge - light and heat).
"
Bozaleli ya Chimi ya mai ezali nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Atomes hydrogene mibale na Atome Oxygene moko**

The passage explicitly states: ""Mai esalemi na baatome mibale ya hydrgene mpe atome moko ya oxygene."" (Water is made of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen).
"
"Tango mai ebongoli lolenge ya kozala, nini ekotikala lolenge moko?","Eyano ya malamu ezali:

"Kolanda maloba wana, pona bituku zomi na misato nini kati na mae malandi ezalaki likambo pona kotiya mibeko songolo pakala?","The correct answers are **B** and **C**. Here's why:

*   **B: Kozanga kibokonzi na Congrès (Lack of power in Congress):** The passage explicitly states, ""Congrès ezalaki te na bokonzi ata moko ya kosenga bampako...Ezala mpe na bokonzi ya kolongola mibeko ya mpako mpe mintango batia kati na bituka."" This demonstrates a significant lack of power in the Congress, making it difficult to implement any uniform policy.

*   **C: Bongwana oyo esengelaki kondimama na bato nyonso (Amendment required unanimous consent):** The passage highlights this as a major problem: ""Mibeko ezalaki kosenga kondima na motema mobimba na bituka nyonso liboso babongola yango..."" requiring unanimous consent made any changes to the governing rules exceedingly difficult.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as accurate:

*   **A: Mikonzi ya likolo kotelemela makasi (Strong opposition from state leaders):** While the passage mentions state leaders often not wanting to comply with Congressional laws, this is a *consequence* of the weak Congress, not the root cause of the difficulty in enacting policies.

*   **D: Mokonzi ya kokamba oyo abanadaki komonana te (Lack of a visible guiding leader):** The absence of a President is mentioned but the more significant factors are the lack of Congressional authority and the requirement for unanimous consent for amendments.

**Therefore, the best answers based on the passage are B and C.**"
"Kolanda maloba wana, maloba nini elimboli malamu lolenge ya boyangeli monene na tango ya etumba ya Botomboki","Maloba oyo eza malamu koleka pona kolimbola lolenge ya boyangeli monene na tango ya etumba ya Botomboki eza **C: Mikonzi ya Leta bazalaki komonana te.**

Ntina: Maloba ya P elobi polele ete Congrès ezalaki te na bokonzi ya kosenga bampako (na makasi), mpe basololaki na bakonzi ya leta mpo na kolanda mibeko, kasi mbala mingi bazalaki kolinga te kotosisa yango.  Yango elakisi ete bakonzi ya leta bazalaki na bokonzi mingi mpe Congrès ezalaki na mpasi ya kosala ete balanda mibeko.

*   **A: Kofuta mpako etiyamaki na makasi na Congrès mpe Boyangeli monene:** Maloba ya P elobi ete Congrès ezalaki te na bokonzi ya kosenga bampako.

"
Na mae malandi Mboka Singapor eyebani pona nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Engumba ya mobesu**.

"
"Kolanda maloba wana, banyama balei matiti basalaka mobembo kouta wapi pona koluka bambua?","The correct answer is **B: The northern hills**.

The passage states: ""Mbula nyonso pene ya sanza ya zomi pene ya banyama 1,5 milio oyo eliaka matiti ekendaka na bisobe ya sudi, bakatisaka ebale Mara, longwa na bangomba ya nordi mpona kokima bambula."" This translates to: ""Every year around October about 1.5 million herbivores go to the southern plains, cross the Mara River, from the northern hills to escape the rains.""

Therefore, they start their journey from the northern hills.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Banyama balei matiti bautaka esika nini kobanda sanza ya minei?","The correct answer is **A: Etuka ya Serengeti**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the animals migrate *to* the southern plains around October to escape the rains.
*   They return north and west after the rainy season (around month 4) which means they are returning to the Serengeti.
*   Option D, esika babombaka biloko ya Maasai Mara is where they head to after the Serengeti.

Therefore, *Etuka ya Serengeti* is the origin point after month 4."
Operation Sealion ezalaki kokota na makasi ya Mboka nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Grande Britagne**.

The text clearly states that ""Allemagne ebandaki kobongama mpona kokota na makasi na Grande-Bretagne. Allemagne ebengaka bitumba wana """"Mosala Sealion""""."" This means Operation Sealion was Germany's plan to invade Great Britain.
"
Alemagne ebengaki kobundisa Grande Britagne kombo nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Operation Sealion**. The passage states that ""Allemagne ebengaka bitumba wana """"Mosala Sealion""""."" which translates to ""Germany called this war """"Operation Sealion"""".""
"
Na mae malandi nini oyo elobami te lokola eteni na malengeli ya Italy pona Kobotola Bamboka ya Africa?,"The correct answer is **B: Kotonga Bamasuwa misusu** (Building more ships).

Here's why:

*   **A: Kolongola bamasuwa na Egypte (Removing ships from Egypt):** This is mentioned in the passage as a goal, removing ships to pass through the Mediterranean
*   **C: Kotiya masuwa yakomema basoda (Sending ships to transport soldiers):** This is explicitly stated as a necessity to transport troops to Africa.
*   **D: Kobebisa bisika ya bamasuwa ya Grande Britagne (Destroying British Naval infrastructure):** The passage states that Italy wanted to remove British presence and that they intended to do that by removing ships in Egypt.

The passage mentions that Italy HAD built four new ships *before* the war. It does *not* mention that they were planning to build *more* ships as part of their plans for African conquest. Therefore, ""Building more ships"" is not mentioned as part of their plans."
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ezalaki ntina ya motuya ya Italy pona Etumba?","The correct answer is **A: Kokamata mikili ya Afrika**.

The passage states that Italy's main goals were in Africa and that they needed ships to transport troops there. This clearly indicates that taking African territory was a primary objective.
"
Nani esalaki boyokani ya malamu na babotoli mboka?,"The correct answer is **B: Ba Vichy French**.

The passage states that American and French soldiers liberated southern France during Operation Dragoon. The Vichy French were collaborators with the Germans, not allies of the Americans.
"
Bozalisi ya teknolozi nini esalaki ba sou-marin kobanda kotambola nase ya mai?,"The correct answer is **D: Radar**.

The passage states that ""ntango babandaka kosala baradare pe yango ezalaki sikisiki, basoda babundaka na mai bakomaki kokende na se ya mai mpo bato bamona bango te."" This translates to ""when they started making radar and it became accurate, naval soldiers started going underwater so people wouldn't see them."" This implies that the development of radar led to submarines spending more time submerged to avoid detection.
"
"Na Bosaleli na bango ya yambo, ba sou-marin bazalaki na esika mukie ya kotambola na esika nini?","The correct answer is **C: Bamasasi**.

The passage states: ""Na ntango wana, ezalaki kotambola malembe mpenza pe ezalaki na **masasi mingi te**."" This translates to ""At that time, it traveled very slowly and had **few weapons**."" Therefore, in their early use, submarines had a limited capacity for weapons.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nani abebisaki boyokani? ","The correct answer is **D: Ba Soviets**.

The passage explicitly states that the Soviet Red Army violated the Treaty of Riga and the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Poland by invading eastern Poland.

The text states that Marshal Italo Balbo was killed in Tobruk.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, mayele nini na mae malandi ezali ya litomba mingi na Bomanioli ya Tibetan ?","The passage states that Kundalini Yoga (which is a part of Tibetan Buddhism) uses breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations. It also mentions that visualizing deities is central to Tibetan meditation. Therefore, all of the options are helpful in Tibetan meditation, but the MOST beneficial, according to the text, is:

*   **C: Komona Kibonzambe (Visualizing deities)**
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, lolenge nini bachakras efungwamaka na tango ya “Litomba monene” ya Bomanioli ya Tibetan","The correct answer is **B: Na nzela ya komona kibonzambe**.

The text states: ""Na kotalaka banzambe ndenge na ndenge, banzela ya nguya esokwamaka, bachakras efungwamaka mpe bososoli ya koyeba esalemaka."" This clearly links the opening of chakras to visualizing deities.
"

*   Then Lakkha Singh took the lead.

Therefore, the second devotional song was presented by **Lakkha Singh**. So the answer is (B).
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Nani ayembaki nzembo ya losambo na ngonga ya makabo ya bilei?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The text states: ""Na nsima, Lakkha Singh azwaki esika ya liboso na koyemba banzembo ya bhajans. Basani 108 ya Chhappan Bhog...bapesaki yango na Baba Shyam."" This clearly indicates that Lakkha Singh was singing bhajans at the time of the Chhappan Bhog offering.

"
"Kolanda maloba wana, liloba nini ezali ya solo te?","The correct answer is **D: Ezuaki pene ya ba ngonga 60 ponakobimisa moto ya liboso na nzela**

Here's why:

*   The text states it took ""kaka ngonga moko mpona kolongola moto ya liboso na nzela,"" meaning it took only **one hour** to remove the first person, not 60 hours.

Na mae malandi nini ezalaki te kati ya bantina ya mikonzi ya Amsterdam na musee pona nzete,"The correct answer is **B: Esengeli kobatelama**.

The passage states the reasons for wanting to cut down the tree were:

*   It was sick.
*   It was a danger to the public.
*   It was in danger of falling.

The passage does *not* say that the authorities believed it *should* be protected, but rather that they wanted to cut it down. So, ""Esengeli kobatelama"" (It should be protected) is the reason that was *not* among the reasons of the authorities.
"
"Kolanda Mokonzi inspecteur ya RSPCA, ba inspection esengeli kosalema malamu pona nini?","The correct answer is **D: Bisika ya koboma banyama**.

The passage states that the RSPCA is requesting CCTV cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses (bisika ya koboma banyama). The rest of the options are related, but the question is why inspections should be better, and the passage says it should happen in places that slaughter animals.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini ekoki kosunga kolendisa litomba ya bozali malamu ya banyama epai ya bato oyo basalaka mosala na bisika ya koboma banyama na Australi","The correct answer is **A: Kotiya ba Camera CCTV**.

"
"Kolanda maloba wana, moto oyo bakangaki ye azalaki kosala mosala nini?","The correct answer is **none of the above**.

"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na tango bansango ezalaki kopanzana na mae matali bokangemi mosusu, bamatanga ezalaki kosalema pona bato boni?","The correct answer is **D: Minei**.

The text states that Poland initially signed ACTA, which led to protests. However, due to the protests, the Polish government has now delayed ratifying the agreement (putting it on hold for now). This means they have not finalized the agreement. The text does not say that Germany, Scotland, or Lithuania are refusing to sign the agreement.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, mboka nini na mae malandi eboyaki kokoba na eteni yakokota na ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: Lettonie**.

"
ACMA emonaki nini na mae matali Big Brother?,"Correct Answer: A: Mibeko yakopekisa biloko na internet ebuakami te

Explanation: The premise of the statement P is that Big Brother did not violate internet censorship laws because the video wasn't hosted on their own site. The argument is that for something to be considered ""posted"" online, it needs to be on a server. Therefore, the censorship laws, focused on content broadcast, weren't applicable because the video wasn't directly uploaded by Big Brother. The conclusion that follows is that there was no violation of internet censorship laws.
"
Esengeli eloko ezala na esika nini pona kobengama biloko ya interenet ?,"The correct answer is **B: Esengeli ezala na kati ya server**.

The argument P clearly states that for something to be considered ""biloko batie na internet,"" it needs to reside on a server. The other options are incorrect based on the information provided in the paragraph.

The text says ""Moto ya ski ya Pologne Maciej Krezel na **motambwisi** Anna Ogarzynska basilisaki na bisika ya zomi na misato na Super-G."" Motambwisi means guide, so Maciej Krezel skied with a guide. While Anna Ogarzynska *is* the guide, the question asks who participated with a guide, so the answer is Maciej Krezel.
"
Mboka nini esilisaki na esika ya zomi na “the Super-G na women’s standing class”?,"The correct answer is **A: Filande (Finland)**.

The text states: ""moto ya Finlande Katja Saarinen oyo asilisaki na esika ya zomi na komekama moko wana."" This implies Katja Saarinen of Finland finished in 10th place in ""the women's standing class"".
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, liloba nini na mae matali Blake ezali ya solo te?","The correct answer is **B: Andimaki pona etumba**.

Here's why:

*   **P says:** ""Moto azalaki kosala yango oyo bakangaki na ebayelo, **aboyaki makambo wana**..."" - This translates to ""The person who did it, who was arrested at the scene, **denied those things**..."" This directly contradicts option B, which claims he admitted to fighting.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: Bakangaki ye ebayelo** - ""Moto azalaki kosala yango oyo bakangaki na ebayelo..."" (The person who did it, who was arrested at the scene...)
*   **C: Asalelaki nzete na ngonga ya etumba** - ""...alobaki ete asalaki nzete mpona komibatela na milangi..."" (...he said he used the tree to protect himself from bottles...)
*   **D: Alobaki ete babwakelaki ye milangi** - ""...mpona komibatela na milangi oyo bazalaki kobwakela ye..."" (...to protect himself from bottles being thrown at him...)"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi esalemaki na Blake te?","The correct answer is **C: Babundisaki ye na nzete**.

Here's why:

* **P says:** ""Moto azalaki kosala yango oyo bakangaki na ebayelo, aboyaki makambo wana mpe alobaki ete asalaki nzete mpona komibatela na milangi oyo bazalaki kobwakela ye na bato mosusu."" This translates to ""The person who did that and was arrested, denied the charges and said that he made the tree to defend himself against bottles that were being thrown at him by other people."" Therefore, Blake built the tree, not was hit with a tree.
* **A: Bakutaki ye na mbeba ya kolinga kotia mobulu na esambiselo:** ""Balobaki ete Blake azalaki koluka kobebisa makambo po basambisa yango malamu te."" This translates to ""They said Blake was trying to disrupt the proceedings."" Therefore, Blake was found guilty of trying to disrupt the proceedings.
* **B: Bakangaki ye:** ""Moto azalaki kosala yango oyo bakangaki na ebayelo..."" This translates to ""The person who did that and was arrested..."" Therefore, Blake was arrested.
* **D: Bayebisaki ye ete akokaki kotindama na boloko:** ""Zuzi ayebisaki Blake ete likoki """"ezali ata moke te"""" bakotinda ye na boloko."" This translates to ""The judge told Blake that the possibility of him being sent to prison was """"very slim""""."" Therefore, Blake was told that it was very unlikely that he would be sent to prison.

Therefore, Blake was not hit with a tree, but built a tree for self-defense.

"Kolanda maloba wana, Nations-Unies ezali na elikia yakobikisa nini?","Based on the passage, the United Nations hopes to **mobilize funds to help countries suffering from extreme heat in their fight against it.** These funds can be used for things like flood-proof houses, water conservation, and diverse crops. Therefore, the best answer is related to what these funds are intended to help with.

The best answer is **D: Bato oyo bazali konyokwama pona kozanga mai** (People who are suffering from lack of water). While the passage mentions houses that don't flood, and diverse crops, the underlying problem that the UN is hoping to address with the funds is the suffering caused by extreme heat, which often leads to water scarcity.

"Kolanda maloba wana, pona nini mosala ekoki kobanda na sanza ya Sambo?","The correct answer is **D: Mibeko ya ebandeli mpe kokitisa talo esi endimami** (Basic rules and tariff reductions have already been agreed upon).

The text explicitly states: ""Toyokani naino mibeko ya ebandeli pe ya kondima kokitisa talo, kasi ntango ya kosala yango ebongi mpo tokobanda misala na mokolo ya 1 sanza ya nsambo 2020"" (We have agreed on the basic rules and tariff reduction commitments, and the timing is right for us to start operations on July 1, 2020).  This indicates that the agreement on basic rules and tariff reductions is the key factor enabling the July start date.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, zulunalu ya mibeko ya Atlanta ekutaki mikonzi ya Education na mbeba nini?","The correct answer is **C: Kozanga kosala eloko na makambo ya kati oyo emonanaki** (Failing to act on internal issues that were found).

The passage states: ""Rapore emonisi babakisa mingi mpenza ba resultat ya ba ekzame, pe ete ekanisi ete eteyelo esi emonaki makambo wana kasi basalaki na bango eloko te."" This translates to: ""The report showed that the exam results were greatly inflated, and that it's believed the school already knew about these issues but did nothing about it.""

Therefore, the legal newspaper found the school officials were at fault for failing to act on internal issues they were aware of.

"Kolanda maloba wana, nsango nini eyebani na mae matali Bomb?","The correct answer is **B: Bandako nini Bombi epasukaki penepene na yango**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that three other bombs exploded near study halls (""pene ya bandako ya boyekoli"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Botangi ya suka ya baoyo bazoki**: The passage says the final count is not yet known (""motango ya suka eyebani naino te"").
*   **C: Soki baBombi misusu ya kopasola ezalaki**: The passage doesn't provide any information about other possible bombs.
*   **D: Talo ya Bawei oyo eyebani**: While the passage mentions the number of people who died, that number is disputed (reports say 8, but officials haven't confirmed). Therefore, the ""true"" death toll is not known."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Liwa ezalaki te** (There were no deaths): The text clearly states that there were 15 deaths.
*   **B: Bapaya nyonso bazalaki ya Émirats arabes unis** (All the guests were from the United Arab Emirates): The text only says *many* of the guests were from the UAE, not all of them.

Lisolo elobi polele ete biloko mibale oyo eyokani (aside cyanurique na melamine) esalaki ""libanga oyo ekoki kokanga ngei mpo esala te,"" oyo ezali nde bakristaux.
"
Baluki basalelaki Infrarouge pona kotala nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ba crystaux na masuba ya Niau**.

The text states that researchers used infrared (FTIR) to analyze the crystals formed in the cat kidneys when they added melamine and cyanuric acid. It also mentions that the composition of these crystals matched those found in the kidneys of animals that got sick. Therefore, the primary purpose of the infrared analysis was to study the crystals in the cat kidneys.
"
Nani abengaki Luna “Queen of Extreme”?,"According to the passage, Tommy Dreamer said ""Luna azalaki mokonzi mwasi ya liboso ya mindondo."" This translates to ""Luna was the first Queen of Extreme.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: Tommy Dreamer**
"
Nani abengaki Luna “moto ya ndege”?,"None of the provided options are correct. Tommy Dreamer said ""Luna was the first queen of hardcore."" The answer is therefore D.
"
Nini esalemaki te na shofere oyo azalaki na aksida?,"The correct answer is **C: Bamemaki ye na lopitalo moko na Great Yarmouth kouta lopitalo ya Cambridge** (They took him to a hospital in Great Yarmouth from a hospital in Cambridge).

The text states he was first taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth, then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. So the order was from Great Yarmouth to Cambridge, not the other way around. The other options are true based on the text.
"
Na mae matali lisano ya Rugby ya Afrique ya sudi nini ezalaki eloko ya kokamwisa te?,"The correct answer is **C: Mosala malamu mingi na ebandeli ya tournoi** (Very good performance at the beginning of the tournament).

The passage describes South Africa's strong start and mentions their defensive skills, passing skills, and teamwork as reasons for their dominance. While these are positive attributes, the question asks what *wasn't* particularly surprising. A strong start for the top-ranked team (South Africa) is the least surprising of the attributes listed. The text stresses the surprise of their success.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, lisano ya Afrique ya sudi ebandaki kobonga na ngonga nini?","The correct answer is **A: Na Ngonga 10:00**.

The passage states directly: ""Lisano ebandaki na 10h00..."" (The game started at 10:00...). The other options describe aspects of their play *after* the game started, not when their improvement began.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini na mae malandi elimboli malamu te nkita ya Mobaka Chine?","The correct answer is **D: Chine etikala koteka mituka ebele libanda te koleka Alemagne**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Mpona mbala ya liboso, na mobu eleki Chine etekaki mituka mingi na libanda koleka Allemagne..."" which directly contradicts option D.
*   The other options are all supported by the information in the passage:

    *   A: The passage mentions that China's economy has risen 90 times since its economic reforms, so it can be implied that China's commerce has grown drastically since the economic reforms.
    *   B: The passage states that China has more foreign automobile sales than America, so it can be inferred that China has a larger automobile economy than America.
    *   C: The passage mentioned that China's GDP could exceed the US within the next two decades.

Therefore, option D is the only statement that is not true based on the given passage."
"Kolanda maloba wana, na tango nini PIB ya Chine ekokaki koleka ya Amerike?","The correct answer is **B: Na kati bambula tuku mibale**

The passage states: ""PIB ya Chine ekoki koleka ya États-Unis nsima ya mibu tuku mibale."" (The GDP of China is likely to surpass that of the United States in two decades.)
"
Lolenge nini Hu alendisaki mikili ya bobola ?,"The correct answer is **D: Koboya banzela ya kala ya mabe**.

The passage states: ""Alendisaki mikili ya bobola """"na koboya kolanda nzela ya kala ya kobebisa naino mpe kopetola na nsima."""" ""  This directly translates to ""He encouraged developing countries to avoid the old path of polluting first and cleaning up later."" Therefore, option D is the correct paraphrase of his encouragement.
"
Nini elobamaki na Hu te?,"The correct answer is **C: Mokolo oyo bobimisi carbone dioxyde ekosila (The date that carbon dioxide emissions will end)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Hu did not provide a specific reduction *target* (D: Talo ya kokitisa kobimisa carbone dioxyde).
*   The passage mentions Hu's statement regarding the need to reduce CO2 intensity per unit of GDP (P).
*   The passage includes Hu's encouragement to developing countries regarding avoiding the ""pollute first, clean up later"" model.
*   The passage doesn't mention any timeline for *ending* carbon dioxide emissions, only *reducing* their intensity relative to economic output."
"Na oyo elandi, Veerman alobaki ete makambo ezali mabe na ntina ya nini?","The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

The text quotes Richard Veerman saying, ""Angola ezokende na mpasi ya makasi koleka pe makambo eza kaka mabe mingi Angola,"" which translates to ""Angola is going through a very difficult time and things are very bad in Angola."" Thus, he's saying things are bad in **Angola**.
"
"Sima ya bosambi , nani akozua mosala ya Huhne na Cabinet?","Correct answer: A
"
Nani akozua Mosala ya Ministre ya mombongo mokolo moko liboso ya esambiselo?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

The text states: ""Tozozela ete Norman Lamb andima kozala ministre des Affaires na esika ya Davey."" which translates to ""We expect Norman Lamb to take over as minister of affairs in Davey's place.""

Since the question asks who will be the Minister of Affairs *one day before* the court date (February 16th), and the change will have already happened at that point, Lamb will be in that position.
"
Ba Artistes bayebisaki bafan kosala nini na tango ya “Opera Camile Saint-Saen”?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: Komata na podium elongo na bango**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""teyatre yango moko elendisaka bato na kosangana"" which translates to ""the theater itself encourages people to participate/join in"". Therefore, they are encouraged to come on stage with the artists."
Nani amelaki Bangi liboso na tango ya “Opera”?,"The correct answer is **C: Basani**.

The passage states: ""basani bamelaka mbangi ntango bazosala teyatre"" which translates to ""actors smoke marijuana while performing theater."" Therefore, the actors are the ones smoking marijuana.
"
Kombo mosusu ya “spacewalk” oyo Leonv asalaki ezali nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Extravehicular activity**.

The passage states: ""...asalaki mosala ya liboso babengi *extravéhiculaire habitée (EVA)*, to """"kotambola na mapata"""",..."" This directly translates to ""he performed the first operation called extravehicular activity (EVA), or 'spacewalk',...""
"
Leonov akambaki ba Soviet pona mission nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The text says: ""Mibu zomi na nsima, akambaki eteni ya mosala ya Union Soviétique, Apollo-Soyouz oyo ezalaki elembo ya suka mbangu na likolo."" which translates to ""Ten years later, he led the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission which was a sign of the end of the Space Race.""
"
Nani azokaki na aksida?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson** and **C: Bana**.

Here's why:

*   **Gibson:** The passage states, ""nsima ya aksida, bamemaki Gibson na lopitalo kasi akufaki nsima ya ntango mokuse,"" meaning ""after the accident, Gibson was taken to the hospital but died shortly after."" This indicates Gibson was injured in the accident.
*   **Bana:** The passage states, ""Ezalaki na bana oyo bazalaki kozela kokatisa nzela pe bango nyonso bazalaki kotia makelele pe kolela. Bango nyonso bazokaki nsima longwa na esika aksida esalemaki,"" which means ""There were children waiting to cross the road and they were all making noise and crying. They were all injured after leaving the accident scene."" So the children were injured.
*   **Mokumbi mituka ya minene:** The passage states, ""Mokumbi motuka, oyo azalaki na mibu 64, azokaki te na aksida wana,"" meaning ""The driver, who was 64 years old, was not injured in the accident.""
*   **Mosali na Garage:** The passage only indicates that the person works at a nearby garage. They were never mentioned as being injured.

"
Nini esalemaki na bato oyo bazalaki na aksida?,"The correct answer is **B: Moko azokaki, moko akufaki**.

The text states that Gibson died, and the 64-year-old driver was uninjured. So one person died and one was uninjured (which could be considered a type of injury, just not a physical one).

While the text also mentions children crying, they were not directly involved in the accident itself.
"
Bato ya siansi oyo bazalaki kosala na programe wana bazalaki kotia elekia ya komona ba effets ya nini na mae malandi?,"The correct answer is **D: Biloko ya moindo**.

The passage states: ""Makambo ekipe ezalaki koluka eutaki na bambonge ya makasi na kati ya galaxie ya moindo pe **biloko ya moindo** oyo ezalaki na La Voie lactée.""  This shows the team was looking for the effects of dark matter. Also, the passage specifically mentions that the scientists were looking for the influence of dark matter on other dark matter.
"
"Bato ya siansi bazalaki kotalela biloko ya nini na ,mae malandi?","The correct answer is **D: The Sagittarius galaxy and the Milky Way**.

The passage describes how the Milky Way's gravitational pull affects the Sagittarius galaxy, comparing it to the moon's effect on the Earth. The scientists are studying these two galaxies and the dark matter within and surrounding them.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, bato ya Party Conservatives bazali koseka te eloko nini?","Réponse ya malamu ezali **A: Ndenge ya kosalela lisungi**.

Polo na yango: Ba conservateurs bazalaki koseka ndenge mbongo ya lisungi eza kosalelama (badépenses ya kosilisa bato mpe kotonga lisusu) nde bazalaki kobenga yango ""Boyokani ya Bush na Nouvelle-Orléans"".
"
Nani azali koseka bacontrat ya lisungi pona kotonga lisusu Hurricane Katrina?,"Based on the text provided, the answer is **A: Babateli likita ya makambo makasi**.

The text states: ""bato mosusu ya leta oyo batalelaka nkita ya leta ya makambo makasi babengaki yango na ndenge ya kosekisa """"Boyokani ya Bush na Nouvelle-Orléans."""" "" This indicates that those who have a more conservative view of government spending are mocking the way funds were used for Hurricane Katrina reconstruction contracts.

Yango elakisi ete mwinda ekomonana yambo na **B: Northern California**.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Mpepo ya vitesi ekosala record ya nini na mae malandi?","The correct answer is **C: Kozonga na mabele mbangu mingi**.

The passage states that Stardust will set a new record for being the fastest spacecraft to *return* to Earth. The other options are either not mentioned or are secondary effects of the speed, not the primary record being set.
"
Lolenge nini Dr. Malar Balasubramanian ayebanaki na Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Maman moboti**

The passage states: ""Monganga Malar Balasubramanian... nsima ya komona mama na ye ya kokufa na nsima ya motuka na ye"" which translates to ""Dr. Malar Balasubramanian... after her mother was found dead in the trunk of her car"".
"
Ebembe ya Balasubramanian ezuamaki wapi?,"The correct answer is **C: Na kati ya cofre ya mutuka** (Inside the trunk of the car).
"
EBay esombaki nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The text mentions that the company (eBay) wants to increase its presence in areas where Skype is strong, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil. This indicates that eBay acquired Skype.
"
EBay ezali koluka kosala nini na bosombi oyo?,"The prompt P says the company wants to:

*   Increase profitability (kokembisa matomba naye)
*   Gain more exposure (komatisa koyebana naye)
*   Reach markets where Skype is strong (kokoma na bisika misusu)

Therefore, the correct answer includes A, B, and C. Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: Kokembisa matomba naye (Increase profitability):**  This is directly mentioned in the prompt.
*   **B: Kokoma na bisika misusu (Reach new markets):** This is directly mentioned in the prompt (China, Eastern Europe, Brazil).
*   **C: Komatisa koyebana naye (Increase its visibility/awareness):** This is directly mentioned in the prompt.
*   **D: Kosepelisa baclients naye (Please its customers):** While likely an indirect benefit, it's not the *explicitly stated* primary goal.

Since the question is ""EBay ezali koluka kosala nini na bosombi oyo?"", we should look for the explicit goals.

The best answer is a combination of A, B and C. However, since we can only pick one, it needs to be the one that encompasses most of them.

Given the options, and the information in the passage, the question is really asking ""Why is eBay making this purchase?"". The reasons listed in the passage are A, B and C.

Because the options are listed individually, not in combination, the BEST option would be **all of A, B, and C**. Since that is not possible, the best option would be a selection of them. There is no clear winner.

**Therefore, I cannot select a single correct option from the choices you have provided. All of A, B and C are valid answers.**
"
"Kolanada maloba wana, nani asololaki te na bakangami oyo batikalaki na lopango sima ya etumba?","Eyano ya malamu ezali **D: Basali ya lopitalo**.

Na mae malandi nini etindaki bakangami kotika kotomboka?,"The correct answer is **B: Milinga ya kopanza bato**.

The passage states that after the prisoners set the yard on fire, ""bato ya mosala oyo bazalaki mpona kobundisa batomboki bakotaki na lopango pe babenganaki bakangami na milinga oyo epanzaka bato."" This directly implies that the tear gas forced the prisoners to end their rebellion.
"
"Na emoneli ya Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s , mboka Iran esengeli komitiya mpole yango moko na eloko nini?","The correct answer is **D: Kotalela essence**.

The text explicitly states that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei referred to the country's dependence on gasoline as a ""trap"" since the Iranian Revolution in 1979 and said the country needed to escape it. This directly implies he wants Iran to reduce its reliance on gasoline (essence).
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nani andimaki ba effets ya bipekiseli na mbongo ya Iran?","Esengeli topona eyano oyo ebongi, oyo ezali A: Bakonzi.

"Nakotala makomi oyo elekiKolandana na bokomi, na esika nini kotala ndako monene ekoki kozala mobembo ya congé oyo ezali na ntina?","The correct answer is **C: Na lobwaku ya Rhin**.

The text in P specifically mentions ""bandako minene ya lobwaku ya Loire, ya lobwaku ya Rhin to kokende na masuwa na bisika ya kitoko na Danube to na kokende na canal ya Érié."" Therefore, the Rhin valley is explicitly listed as a place to visit châteaux (bandako minene) during a river cruise or similar vacation.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo elekiKolandana na bokomi, kati na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekozala toli oyo esɛngami te mpo na basi oyo bazali kosala mibembo na esika yango?","Correct Answer: A

Explanation:

The passage specifically advises women to *claim* they are married, regardless of their actual marital status. So, ""Avoid mentioning marital status"" (A) is the opposite of the advice given. The other options (B, C, and D) are all directly or indirectly supported by the provided text.
"
"Na kotalela esika oyo mokapo yango elobeli, toli nini ekozala malamu mpo na basi oyo bazali kosala mibembo?","The best answer is **D: Na likambo ya bokóli oyo olingi te, zalá ngwi na koboya mibali**.

Here's why:

*   The passage directly advises women to be firm in rejecting unwanted male attention.
*   The passage emphasizes the importance of knowing the cultural norms.
*   The passage states that women travelling should claim they are married, regardless if they are, and to wear rings.
*   The passage stresses that women are expected to stand their ground even amidst different practices."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, likambo nini ekoki kosɛnga moto oyo azwaka ba foto ya banyama ya zamba asalela zoom moko ya sipesiale?","The correct answer is **A: Soki bazo photographier mingi-mingi banyama mike**.

The passage states that ""biloko neti etuluku ya bandeke to ya bikelamu mosusu ya mike esengaka zoom ya ndenge mosusu."" This translates to ""things like groups of birds or other small creatures require a different kind of zoom."" Therefore, if photographing small animals, a special zoom might be required.
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobelami te na mokapo yango lokola mokakatano oyo ekoki kozala mpo na bato oyo bazwaka ba foto ya banyama ya zamba?","The correct answer is **D: Kosala na bisika oyo ekoki kozala na banguna** (Working in potentially hostile environments).

Here's why:

*   **A: Kozwa banyama mosusu ya mikili mosusu** (Getting animals from other countries) is mentioned in the passage: ""Ezalaka mpasi na kozwa banyama mingi oyo eutaka na bamboka mosusu..."" (It is difficult to find many animals that come from other countries...).

*   **B: Kosala na banyama oyo ezali na nkanda** (Working with angry animals) is mentioned in the passage: ""Banyama ya zamba bakoki kozala sonisoni to mobulu."" (Wild animals can be shy or aggressive.)

*   **C: Koluka lolenge ya ba objectifs oyo esengeli** (Finding the correct type of lenses) is mentioned in the passage: ""Mbala mingi mpona kokanga bafoto ya banyama esengaka kozala na zoom ya molai, kasi biloko neti etuluku ya bandeke to ya bikelamu mosusu ya mike esengaka zoom ya ndenge mosusu."" (Often to take photos of animals requires a long zoom, but things like groups of birds or other small creatures requires a different zoom).

*   **D: Kosala na bisika oyo ekoki kozala na banguna** (Working in potentially hostile environments) While the passage mentions the environment can be cold, hot, or uncomfortable, it does **not** explicitly state that the environment could be *hostile* in the sense of being dangerous from enemies (like other people or groups). The dangers discussed are natural (weather, animal behavior).

Therefore, D is the correct answer because it's the only option not directly addressed in the passage."
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekobimisa mikakatano mingi te mpo na mokumbi motuka oyo azali koleka na nzela ya bangomba?","The correct answer is **A: Mituka mingi**

Here's why:

*   **P says:** The passage focuses on the dangers of snow, ice, and extreme cold when driving in mountainous areas. It mentions reduced friction, potential avalanches, and poor visibility.
*   **A: Mituka mingi (Many cars):** While traffic can be an inconvenience, it's not directly related to the specific hazards of snow, ice, and cold described in the passage.
*   **B: Friction ya moke (Low friction):** The passage explicitly states that low friction on snowy and icy roads is a significant problem.
*   **C: Condensation eleki ndelo (Excessive condensation):** While condensation can worsen visibility, the passage focuses more on snow and ice on the windshield as the main issue.
*   **D: Komona ekiti (Reduced visibility):** The passage directly mentions that snowfall, blowing snow, and ice on the windshield can severely impair visibility.

Therefore, increased traffic volume doesn't necessarily present the same type of challenge as the other options. So, **A** is the correct answer."
Nini ekoki kotikala ndenge moko na oyo etali mpako ya bozwi na mikili ndenge na ndenge?,"The correct answer is **C: Esika ozali kosala dossier** (Where you file your taxes).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that tax systems and rates vary significantly from country to country. This means options A (amount) and B (how it's paid) are unlikely to be the same across different countries. Option D (parentheses) has no relationship to the subject being discussed.
*   The one thing that remains relatively constant, even across countries, is the basic requirement to **file** your taxes (make a tax dossier). Even if the rules, forms, and payment methods are different, the fundamental act of submitting your tax information is generally consistent.

So, C is the most logical and consistently applicable factor in dealing with tax in any country."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, soki ozali kosala na mikili ya bapaya kasi ozali na esika mosusu, mbala mosusu okokotisa mpako na yo ya mosolo wapi?","Based on the passage, the most accurate answer is **C: Na mboka oyo ozali kosala sikoyo** (In the country where you are currently working).

The passage explicitly states that working in a foreign country as a diplomat often means paying taxes in that host country. While option A (wherever you live mostly) could be argued, the passage emphasizes the foreign assignment aspect. Options B and D are not supported by the text.
"
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola malamu te Foire mondiale?","The correct answer is **D: Ba pays esengeli te ba participer**.

Here's why:

*   **P** (the passage) states that participating countries showcase their advancements and culture. Therefore, the statement in D that says ""countries don't have to participate"" contradicts the information in passage P.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Ba expositions ekoki kolakisa histoire to culture ya mboka moko** - This aligns with the passage's description of countries showcasing their history and customs.
*   **B: Ba expositions botaniques elakisami pembeni ya ba expositions artistiques mpe éducatives** - The passage mentions horticultural displays as important events.
*   **C: Makambo ekoki kowumela sanza motoba** - The passage states that the events often last between three and six months.

So, D is the only statement that is not supported by or is in direct contradiction with the passage.
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali mobeko ya Foire mondiale to Exposition internationale?","Based on the provided text (P), the correct answer is **B: Mboka moko ekoki koyamba milulu yango mbula na mbula te** (A country cannot host these events every year).

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Atako na munoko ekoki kosalema mbala moko na mbula (soki esalemi na mikili mikeseni), na koloba solo esalemaka bongo te."" This translates to ""Although in theory it could be held every year (if it were held in different countries), in reality it doesn't happen that way."" Therefore, one country cannot host the event every year.

The other options are incorrect:

*   A: The text mentions exhibiting both the history of the nation and global issues, but not that is strictly a *requirement*.
*   C: The text says that the events *usually* last between three and six months, not that they *must* last six months.
*   D: The text doesn't say *all* countries must participate, only that multiple countries participate."
Kosala oyo wapi kati na makambo oyo elandi ekokitisa likoki ya kobundisa banyama?,"Mpo na kokitisa likoki ya kobundisama na banyama, tosengeli kolanda malako oyo bakonzi ya parke bapesaka mpe kotosa malako ya libateli.

The correct answer is **D: Banyama oyo bameseni na bato te**
"
Na mae malandi nini ezali te kati ya Vote ya mboka France?,"The correct answer is **D: Vote etangemi na bamonisi** (Vote is counted by representatives).

Here's why:

*   **A: Ba kitunga ya komonana na kati** is mentioned in the passage: ""Banda na 1988, bisika ya kotia bulletin ya vote esengeli komonana na kati...""
*   **B: Bamonisi oyo batindami na ba Candidats** is mentioned in the passage: ""Bakandida bakoki kotinda mimonisi na bango mpona komona makambo nyonso.""
*   **C: Kotiya moboko na mokanda ya vote** is mentioned in the passage: ""Soki bakonzi basilisi kotala mikanda ya moto azovote, moto yango atiaka anvelope na kitunga mpe atiaka maboko na mokanda ya vote.""
*   The passage says ""basali ya bolingo malamu bakotanga maponi wana bazokengela bango makasi"" which translates to ""volunteers count the votes while being watched closely,"". This does not indicate that the vote is counted by the representatives sent by candidates.

Therefore, **D** is the only option not directly stated in the provided text."
Esika nini bato ya kovoter batiaka kombo ya candidat na bango?,"The correct answer is **B: Na mokanda oyo babeti na mashine**.

The passage states: ""...batiaka papie oyo basi baniata na mashine mpona kopona moto bakopona mpe batiaka yango na amvelope moko."" (They put a paper that they printed on a machine to choose who they will vote for and put it in an envelope.)
"
Nini etindaki Allen kobanda bolukiluki ya mbula mwambe pona Musashi?,"Eyano ya malamu ezali **D: Mposa naye na Etumba**.

Lisolo elobi polele ete Allen abandaki koluka Musashi na komipesaka mingi na bitumba (""abandaki kosala milende mpona kozwa Mushasi na komipesaka mingi na bitumba""). Atako bozwi na ye (A) pe kotia yango na bolukiluki (C) esalisaki ye, pe karte ya nse ya mai (B) esalisaki na koluka, ntina ya liboso ezalaki mposa na ye ya bitumba.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Allen atiyaki bozui naye ebele na eloko nini?","The correct answer is **A: Kozongisa Musashi**.

The passage states: ""Allen akotisaki bozwi na ye mingi na misala ya masuwa pe abandaki kosala milende mpona kozwa Mushasi na komipesaka mingi na bitumba."" This directly translates to Allen investing heavily in naval affairs and making efforts to find the Musashi through extensive combat preparation. The ultimate goal of these efforts and investment in naval affairs was to find/recover the Musashi.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, na mae malandi nini ekokaki kotinda aksida elekana na kati mpe nzinganzinga ya mokili?","Eyano ya malamu ezali **B: Radioactif Cesium**

**Explication:**

Lisolo elobi polele ete Lisanga ya nikleyere ya Japon emonaki césium na iode ya radioactifs na kati ya izine. Césium ya radioactif ezali elembo ya kobebisama ya likolo oyo ekoki kotinda aksida elekana na kati mpe nzinganzinga ya mokili. Milinga ya pete, atako ezali kobimisa likama, ezali te etinda aksida elekana na bisika mosusu lokola césium ya radioactif. Essence ya Iranium mpe Iodine yango moko te nde etinda aksida elekana.
"
Na mae malandi nini ezali te moko ya batoli oyo bapesaki bafandi ya esika kolanda aksida na uzine?,"The correct answer is **C: Koboya kokotisa milinga ya pembe na zolo.**

Here's why:

*   **A: Kotika kosalela baventilateur (Kotika kosalela baventilateur)** - This is a recommendation given in the passage to avoid spreading potential contamination.
*   **B: Kotikala na kati ya ndako (Kotikala na kati ya ndako)** - This is a direct instruction from the authorities.
*   **D: Kotika komela mai ya robine (Kotika komela mai ya robine)** - This is also a direct instruction given by the authorities to avoid consuming potentially contaminated water.

*   **C: Koboya kokotisa milinga ya pembe na zolo (Koboya kokotisa milinga ya pembe na zolo)** - While it's generally a good idea to avoid inhaling any smoke, the specific instruction to avoid inhaling the white smoke through the nose isn't explicitly stated in the passage. The passage says to stay indoors, implying avoiding *all* contact, but not specifying this action.

Therefore, C is the correct answer because it is NOT explicitly mentioned as a recommendation in the provided text."
Kolanda maloba ya Dr. eloko ya motuya pona Moll XDR-TB ezali?,"The correct answer is **D: Ezali na talo ya liwa likolo** (It has a high death rate).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""alobaki lolenge ya sika """"ezotungisa mingi mpe eza mpasi mpo ezoboma bato mingi mpenza."""" This translates to ""he said the new strain """"is very worrying and it's painful because it's killing a lot of people."""""" This indicates a high death rate is a key concern.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: Virisi oyo ezali kozuama na lopitalo** (A virus that is acquired in the hospital): While Dr. Moll suspects hospital transmission, it's not the primary reason he's worried. Hospital transmission is a potential cause, but the deadliness of the strain is the main concern.
*   **B: Virisi ezali kotia tembe na bakisi** (The virus is challenging the medicine): The text says tuberculose esilaka te ata moke soki omeli bakisi (XDR-TB) which translates to ""tuberculosis doesn't end even if you take the medicine (XDR-TB)"" which matches the description of XDR-TB. However, this matches the general characteristics of XDR-TB, not specifically what worries Dr. Moll most.
*   **C: Talo ya bato oyo bakoki kozua virisi kouta na moto moko oyo azali na yango** (The rate of people who can get the virus from someone who has it): While the passage mentions transmission rates, Dr. Moll's primary concern is the deadliness (""ezoboma bato mingi mpenza"") of the XDR-TB strain.

Therefore, the **death rate** is the most important thing about XDR-TB according to Dr. Moll in the passage."
Babeli boni kati ya bae bazuaki virisi bamonani kozala basali na lopitalo?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states that ""mibale kati na bango bazalaki basali ya lopitalo"" which translates to ""two of them were hospital workers"".
"
Lolenge nini ya Teknolozie NextGen ezali kosalela?,"The correct answer is **A: Satellite-based technology**.

The passage states: ""Esalelaka mayele ya satelite na bokeseni na mayele ya kala oyo esimbamaki na radare na mabele...""  This directly translates to: ""It uses satellite technology in contrast to the old technology that was based on radar on the ground...""
"
Lolenge nini NextGen ezali kosalisa ba Pilotes?,"The correct answer is **B: Kopesa mpepo bansango ya solosolo** (Providing pilots with accurate information).

The passage states that NextGen helps pilots by ""...kopesa bapilote basango ebongi"" which translates to ""giving pilots appropriate/correct information."" While the other options are benefits of NextGen, they are not directly how it *helps pilots*.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, bato ya Istware baseki FBI te pona kotiya bokebi mingi na makambo nini?","The correct answer is **C: Kotiya bokebi mingi na makambo ya Pornografi**.

The passage states that Congress started funding anti-obscenity efforts and directed the FBI to dedicate 10 agents to child pornography cases. The historians are criticizing the FBI for focusing on easily solvable crimes, especially car theft, to inflate their success rate. While the passage *mentions* those other aspects, the *historians* are specifically criticizing the focus on easily solvable crimes to artificially inflate their success.  Pornography fits that category: Congress and a large part of the public view it as something the FBI should be tackling, and the passage states they have dedicated agents to do so. The historians are criticizing that decision.
"
Makambo ya bosoto na mobu ya mosala ezali kotinda FBI kosala nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Kotiya basali na makmbo ya pornografi**.

The passage states: ""Congres ebandi kopesa mosolo na makambo ya bosoto na mobu ya mosala 2005 pe elobaki ete FBI kotinda basali 10 po basala pornografi ya mikolo.""  This directly translates to Congress starting to fund pornography in the fiscal year 2005 and saying that the FBI should assign 10 agents to work on child pornography.
"
Nini esalemaki na mutuka ya koboma moto oyo eyaki kosunga na aksida ya JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **A: Esalaki aksida**.

The text says: ""Bapanzi-sango ya mboka balobi ete motuka moko ya aeroport oyo ebomaki moko **ebalukaki** ntango ezalaki kosalisa."" ""Ebalukaki"" means ""turned over,"" implying it had an accident.
"
"Kolanda aksida ya JAS 39C Gripen, Aeropor ekangamaki kopekisa nini?","Eyano ya malamu ezali **A: Mibembo ya mombongo**.

Pologne elobi ete mpepo yango ekweaki pe esalaki ete **mibembo ya mombongo** ekwea te na aéroport wana."
Na tango ya Botomboki ya Iran Brzezinski andimaki kopesa batoli na nani?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The text states that Brzezinski served as NSA for Carter and helped Carter navigate political events like the Iranian Revolution.
"

The passage states that Brzezinski ""azwaki esika ya Henry Kissinger"" as NSA, meaning Brzezinski replaced Kissinger in that role.
"
Na mae malandi nini emonisi te mpenza mosala ya Bobek na Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **D: Abetaki masano ebele koleka ba joueurs nyonso** (He played more games than any other player).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Moto mosusu te asi abeta bamatch ebele to atia mingete mingi mpona ekipe wana koleka Bobek."" This translates to ""No one else has played more matches or scored more goals for that team than Bobek.""

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: Tango azalaki kobeta na ekipe Atiaki mingete koleka 468** (When he was playing for the team, he scored more than 468 goals): The passage says he scored 403 goals in 468 matches, not more than 468 goals.
*   **B: Atiaki mingete ebele koleka ba jouers nyonso** (He scored more goals than all the other players): While he scored the most goals for Partizan, the statement implies he scored more than all other players combined which isn't supported by the text.
*   **C: Na mbala moko aponamaki kozala joueur ya malamu na istwre ya ekipe** (At once he was named the best player in the team's history): The passage says he was selected as the best player in Partizan's history **in 1995**, not immediately or at once.

Therefore, option D most accurately reflects a significant achievement of Bobek at Partizan Belgrade as described in the passage."
Maloba nini na mae matali istware ya Bobek na Partizan ezali ya solo?,"The correct answer is **A: Abandaki kobeta pona Partizan na mbula 1945**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Abetaki pona Zagreb yambo ya Partizan Belgrade** - The text says he was born in Zagreb, but it doesn't say he *played* for Zagreb before Partizan.
*   **C: Abetaki pona Partian tii na mbula 1995** - The text states he stayed with Partizan until 1958, not 1995.
*   **D: Azuaki lokumu pe koyebana mingi sima ya koponama joueur malamu ya Partizan** - The text says he was known while playing for Partizan. The text says his recognition as the best Partizan player was in 1995, much later. So, his fame came before this recognition, not after."

The passage explicitly states that the name ""Hesperonychus"" refers to a large claw, which is a type of toe/finger. The word ""manzaka"" in the options is the word for toe/finger in lingala."

"Kolanda maloba wana, mikonzi bazalaki na motungisi nini pona mae matali Luno?","The correct answer is **C: Koyiba essence**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the ship *Luno* had 120-160 cubic meters of fuel.
*   The passage states ""at the beginning, officials were afraid that the ship would lose its cargo""

Therefore, there was a concern about the ship losing its fuel."

Ba ecran ya batelevizio ebele ya minene, batiaki yango na bisika ndenge na ndenge na Roma..."" This means that screens were put up in various locations in Rome because not everyone could fit *inside* St. Peter's Square for the funeral. They wouldn't need screens *inside* where the funeral was taking place.
"
Molulu ya Matanga esalemaki wapi?,"The correct answer is **C: Na esika ya Saint-Pierre**.

While the passage mentions screens being set up in various locations in Rome and other cities, the **actual funeral service** took place at Saint-Pierre.

"
"Na tango ya kobongola bilembo, moto ya mobulu azangaki kosala nini?","The correct answer is **C: Kobuka yango**.

The text states the vandalism wasn't serious (""Elembo ebebaki mpenza te""). This implies it wasn't broken. The text mentions things were added to the existing sign (symbols of peace and a heart) and the use of black materials to alter the letter.

*   The text does not mention that any police officers were being held hostage by Mendoza
*   The children were among those who were released by Mendoza.
*   The Filipino photographers were held hostage and released by Mendoza.

Therefore, the answer is **B: Ba Policiers**
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, bakangemi nini nsango epesamaki te na ngonga koloba ete batiki bango?","The correct answer is **A: Bato ya kotala mboka**.

The text states that six hostages (including children and the elderly) were released in the morning. The Filipino photographer hostages were also released. However, it does *not* say that all the tourists were released, only that some were killed and some survived.

"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nani azali kozua ba signatire pona kopesa lisungi mpo libale ya basi na basi mpe mibali na mibali ezua ndingisa ya mibeko na mboka Brezil?","Correct answer is **A: Batomboki**.

The text states ""Batomboki bazolikia kozwa basiniatire milio 1,2 mpona kopesa yango na Congre ya mboka..."" which means ""The activists are looking to get 1.2 million signatures to give to the Country's Congress..."". This clearly indicates that the activists are gathering signatures to support the legalization of same-sex marriage.
"
Batomboki bakopesa ba signatire na bango epai ya nani?,"The correct answer is **C: Congrès National Ya Brezil**.

The passage states: ""Batomboki bazolikia kozwa basiniatire milio 1,2 mpona kopesa yango na **Congre ya mboka** na sanza ya zomi na moko.""  ""Congre ya mboka"" translates to ""National Congress"".
"
"Kolanda maloba ya Armand Versace, nini esalamaki mbala moko yambo bato babanda kobulungana pona mopepe?","The correct answer is **C: Mipepe ya makasi ezalaki**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""miniti mitano nsima ya kobanda, mopepe ebandaki kopepa, pene ya miniti moko na nsima, mopepe ekomaki na 70km/h... na nsima mbula ebandaki, kasi ezalaki makasi mpenza yango wana ezalaki neti ezobeta yo mbata na tonga, na nsima mabanga ekweaki na likolo, bato babulungani"". This translates to: ""Five minutes after starting, the wind started blowing, and about one minute later, the wind reached 70km/h... then the rain started, but it was so strong that it was like you were being beaten with pebbles, then hail fell from the sky, people panicked"".

Therefore, right before people panicked, hail fell. However, the question asks what happened before the people panicked because of the wind, not the hail. Right before the hail fell, there was strong wind (70km/h).
"
"Kolanad maloba ya Versace, Mipepe ya makasi mingi ebadaki na ngonga nini?","The correct answer is **A: Ngonga mukie sima ya emoniseli kobanda** (A short time after the event started).

The passage states: ""Miniti mitano nsima ya kobanda, mopepe ebandaki kopepa..."" (Five minutes after it started, the wind started blowing...).  Therefore, the strong winds began shortly after the event began.
"
"Yambo ya Fred,mipepe ya makasi mingi boni emonana na Est ya 35°W?","The answer is B: Misato.

The passage states that Fred is the fourth hurricane that has formed east of 35°W. This means that there have been three hurricanes before Fred that formed east of 35°W.
"
"Na ngonga Fred emonanaki pene ya Ile ya Cape vert, ezalakaki kokende na ndambo nini?","The correct answer is **D: Nordi**.

The passage states: ""Fred eza sikoyo na mipepe ya 105 miles na ngonga moko (165 km/h) pe **ezokende na ndambo ya nordi weste**.""
"
Kati ya bamodele elandi nini ezali na vitesi makasi koleka misusu ya kala?,"The correct answer is **A: Modele 802.11n**

The text clearly states that the 802.11n model is faster than previous models.
"
Esengeli nini po modele 802.11n ekokana na sima na modele 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: Baradio mibale**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ekosalisa yango mpe ekokana na ndenge ya nsima na 802,11a, 802,11b pe 802,11g, longola kaka soki esika station eza, eza na baradio mibale."" This directly says that 802.11n is backward compatible with a, b, and g *unless* the station (device) has two radios.  This means having two radios is a requirement for maintaining backward compatibility.
* **The other options are incorrect because:**
    * **A: Vitesi ya mbangu makasi** - While 802.11n is faster, it's not directly *required* for backward compatibility.
    * **B: Makoki ya modele 802.11b kosala na 5.0Ghz** -  802.11b does *not* operate at 5.0 GHz. This option is factually wrong.
    * **C: Vitesi ebele koleka ya 600Mbit/s** - This is just the maximum speed of 802.11n, not a requirement for backward compatibility.
"
Milulu boni esengelaki na moto oyo azua mbano ya Wolo na Olympic asengelaki kosana na masano ya Commonwealth?,"The correct answer is **B: Misato**

Here's why:

*   The text states the person needed to compete in the 100m, 200m, and the team relay. That's three events."
Pona nini moto oyo azuaki mbano ya wolo na Olympic azalaki komela kisi te pona pasi naye?,"The correct answer is **D: Bapekisa yango Na masano ya Common wealth**.

The text clearly states, ""Akokaki te komela bakisi esengaki mpona kosilisa mpasi na ye mpo bapekisa yango na masano."" which translates to ""He couldn't take the necessary medicine to relieve his pain because it was banned in the games.""
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, nini epesaki kozanga kososola makambo na mae matali koningana ya mabele?","The correct answer is **A: Komonana ya mapata ya moindo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the black clouds near the volcano were obscuring the view and preventing confirmation of whether the volcano had actually erupted. This lack of visibility caused the uncertainty. The other options don't directly explain why the presence of black clouds would cause an issue, so A is the correct option
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Mbongwana na fase esalemaki na tango nini?","C: Sanza ya misato mokolo ya 10

Reasoning:

The passage states: ""Koningana ya mabele ya makasi oyo ebongwani esalamaki na mokolo ya 10 sanza ya misato na nordi este ya songe ya volcan caldera."" (The significant seismic shift occurred on March 10th northeast of the volcanic caldera summit.)  Therefore, the change in phase (the seismic shift) occurred on March 10th.

"
Na mae malandi maloba nini elimboli malamu Sonde ya Lunar?,"The correct answer is **B: Kokita ya aksida ezalaki malamu** (The crash landing was successful).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Moon Impact Probe (MIP) was ""likely to crash land near the lunar south pole."" This indicates a planned, but uncontrolled, descent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ekitaki pene ya ndambu na nordi ya Sanza** (Landed near the north pole of the Moon): The passage explicitly says the probe was intended to land near the *south* pole.
*   **C: Elongolamaki na manned Orbit** (Deployed from a manned Orbit): The passage says the orbiter Chandrayaan-1 was *unmanned*, so this is false.
*   **D: Ezalaki komema bisaleli mibale ya motuya mingi** (It was carrying two important instruments): The passage says it carried *three* scientific instruments, not two.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, malengeli ya lolenge nini ekosalema ya suka pona kobatela na maladi?","The correct answer is **C: Mangwele ya Encephalitis**.

The passage states that the government promised millions of vials of encephalitis vaccine and that this would help improve health infrastructure in the coming year. While the other options are mentioned as measures being taken, the *promised* preparation, which is experiencing delays, is the encephalitis vaccine.
"
Lolenge nini maladi ekomaka epai ya bato?,"The correct answer is **A: Bangungi**.

The text explicitly states that the disease originates in pigs and is then transmitted to humans via mosquitoes.
"
Kozanga ya phrase ya liboso ekoki kopesa nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Boyokani ya civile pona libala ya basi na basi mpe mibali na mibali**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kozanga kolonga ya etumbu ya mibale, oyo ezosenga bapekisa libala ya mibali na mibali to basi na basi, ekoki kobimisa boyokani ya civile na mikolo ezali koya.""  This directly links the failure to ban same-sex marriage with the possibility of civil unions being established.
"
"Kolanda maloba wana, Babomaki phrase ya mibale na ngonga nini?","The correct answer is **A: Na ngonga ya makita ya eleko**.

The passage states, ""Mbongwana esalemaki na makita ya eleko oyo ntango mimonisi ya ministere babomaki phrase ya liboso..."" (The amendment was made during this session's meeting when ministry representatives struck the first phrase...). The question asks about the timing of striking the **second** phrase, but the passage only describes the striking of the first phrase. Since the passage *doesn't* explicitly say when the second phrase was struck (or even *if* it was struck), we have to look at the provided text. There is no mention in the passage of the second phrase being removed.

However, the answers are about the first phrase, and given that one has to be picked, ""Na ngonga ya makita ya eleko"" (during the session's meeting) is the correct choice, referring to the first phrase and not the second.
"
Nani abimisaki “Panama pappers”?,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **B: Zulunalu** (Newspaper).

The text states that the ""Panama Papers"" were ""bato babimisaki"" (released/leaked) in the spring of 2016. While the Mossack Fonseca firm was the source of the documents, it was someone else who released them to the public.

Aksida ya Mpepo nini na mae malandi ebomaki bato ebele koleka?,"The correct answer is **A: Mpepo esalaki aksida na nzela kokende Armenie kouta Iran**.

The passage states that the plane crash en route to Armenia killed 168 people, which is more than the other crashes mentioned. The helicopter crash killed 3 and the Mashhad crash killed 17.
"
Na mae malandi nini ezali te kati ya bantina pona makama ebele ya bampepo na Iran ?,"Esengo na yo!

Based on the text, the following are reasons for Iran's plane crashes:

*   **A: Bampepo ya basivile mpe ya basoda oyo esala kala (Old civilian and military planes):** ""Baaksida ya mpepo esalemaka mingi na Iran, mpo eza na bampepo ya kala ya basivile mpe ya bitumba...""
*   **C: Mipekiselo oyo epekisi kosomba ba mpepo ya sika (Sanctions preventing the purchase of new planes):** ""Etumbu ya mikili mingi elimboli ete bakoki te kosombampepo ya sika.""

The text doesn't directly state:

*   **B: Kozanga mbongo pona kosomba bampepo ya sika (Lack of money to buy new planes):** While sanctions prevent buying new planes, it doesn't explicitly mention lack of funds.
*   **D: Lolenge mabe ya kobatela bampepo (Poor maintenance of planes):** The text implies poor maintenance through neglect but doesn't state it directly.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**D: Lolenge mabe ya kobatela bampepo**"

"
Nini na mae malandi oyo Etuluku ya koyekola makambo ya Iraq elobelaki te ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ekebisi pona kosilisa bitumba na Iraq epesama**.

While the passage does mention that the study group warns that nothing happening in Iraq right now is guaranteed to end the civil war, it doesn't offer a warning specifically about the complete *elimination* of the war itself as a recommendation. The group is focused on mitigating the situation and encouraging political solutions. The other options are clearly supported in the text.

"Kolanada maloba ya Police, nani azalaki moninga ya pemebeni makasi ya Provenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The passage states: ""Polisi elobi ete Lo Piccolo alongaki mpo azalaki moninga ya pembeni ya Provenzano na Palerme..."" which translates to ""The police said that Lo Piccolo succeeded because he was a close friend of Provenzano in Palermo...""

"Kolanda nsango epesami na maloba wana, nini etindaki Falcone na liwa?","The correct answer is **A: Babomaki ye na tango ya Etumba “the Riina-driven war”**.

"Nakotala makomi oyo elekiKolandana na bokomi, ntina nini esalelamaki te mpo na kolimbola kozongela mbala ya mibale oyo elongolamaki?","The correct answer is **C: Kosalela mbongo koleka**.

Here's why:

* **P:** The text states that officials chose to cancel the second election so that Afghan people wouldn't have to spend money on security for another election.

Therefore, the text directly mentions that officials canceled the second election to avoid excessive spending of money on security.
"
"Mpo na nini nsukansuka, batindami bamonaki ete kozongela mbala ya mibale ezalaki na ntina te?","The correct answer is **C: Kozanga bososoli ezalaki kati na mibeko**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Badiplomate balobaki ete bamoni mikakatano mingi na mibeko ya Afghanistan yango wana ntina ya toure ya mibale eza te."" This translates to: ""Diplomats said they saw many problems with Afghanistan's laws, which is why a second round is not necessary.""

The passage implies that the ambiguities and issues within the laws themselves made a second round unnecessary in the eyes of the diplomats."
Nani apesaka lisalisi ya kosamba mpo na FATA?,"The correct answer is **B: Batu ya politike**.

The text states that the ""Bato ya Politiki"" (Political Agents) are responsible for administering and judging according to law 247 in FATA. Therefore, they are the ones who provide the judicial function (lisalisi ya kosamba).

"
Libonza nini filme empo namaki te?,"The correct answer is **B: Bilembo ya kotala koleka**

The prompt lists all the awards the film *did* win. It mentions ""moto abongisaka bafilme"" which translates to film editing. The other awards are explicitly mentioned in the prompt as either won or nominated. Therefore the only award from the prompt not awarded to the film is for ""Bilembo ya kotala koleka"" (Best Visual Effects).

"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi etikalaki kosala nsima ya koningana ya mabele?","According to the text:

*   The Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear plant in Niigata prefecture is functioning properly (this eliminates option D).
*   Reactors 1 and 2 at the Shika nuclear plant were shut down (this eliminates option A).
*   The Noto Airport in Ishikawa remains closed (supports option B).
*   Roads were damaged and roadworks are taking place in the affected area (supports option C).

The best answer is **B: Aeroport na Ishikawa** and **C: Misala ya voirie** since the airport is still closed and roadworks are still taking place. However, if only one choice is allowed, then C is better.
The text explicitly mentions that the airport remains closed and roadworks are underway, implying that these are ongoing tasks following the earthquake.

So, the best single answer is **C: Misala ya voirie**"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ebebaki mpo na koningana ya mabele?","The correct answers are:

*   **C: Banzela mosusu**
*   **D: Aeroport ya Noto**

The passage states that ""banzela mosusu ebeba na yango"" (some roads were damaged) and ""Aeroport ya Noto na Ishikawa eza kaka ya kokanga"" (Noto Airport in Ishikawa is still closed). Although the reactors were shut down, the text doesn't directly state that they were *damaged* because of the earthquake. The text reports the number of buildings without water and electricity, but does not state they were damaged.
"
"Nakotala na makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali na mokanda yango te?","The correct answer is **B: Ntina ya etumba ya 1967**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Mikolo mizali koyia ya Jerusalem** - The text mentions the future of Jerusalem as a point of contention.
*   **C: Kozala ya basoda na lobwaku** - The text specifically discusses the dispute over the presence of Israeli soldiers in the Jordan Valley and the differing views of Israel and the PA on the timeline.
*   **D: Koswana mpo na ndelo** - The entire passage is about the border dispute and Palestine's desire for pre-1967 borders.

The text doesn't delve into the causes or reasons behind the 1967 war. It only uses the war as a historical reference point for the desired borders."
"Nakotala na makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi ezali moko ya makambo oyo Palestine esengaka te?","Eyano ya malamu ezali:

**B: Kozala ya basoda oyo ezali kokoba na lobwaku ya Jordan**

"
Ma ayekolaki mibeko na ekolo nini?,"The text states that Ma studied at Harvard Law School, which is in the United States of America.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: United States of America**.
"
"Nakotala na makomi oyo eleki, kotelema makasi mpo na ekolo nini esalisaki Ma alonga na mampo nampo nami?","The correct answer is **D: Chine**.

The passage states that Ma won ""na ebongiseli oyo ezalaki kolendisa boyokani ya makasi na mboka Chine"" which translates to ""in an organization that encouraged strong relations with China."" This indicates that support for closer ties with China helped Ma win.
"
"Ndenge elobami na mokapo yango, Carolyn Wilson asalaki mpo na nani liboso alongwa na engumba?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

The passage states, ""na kati ya mabota wana bayebaki ete Carolyn Wilson ya OHA ayibaki mbongo oyo babombaki pe akimaki mboka."" This clearly indicates that Carolyn Wilson worked for OHA before fleeing.
"
"Lokola etikali masano minei na eleko, nani azali na esika ya minei ya lisano ya batambwisi mutuka?","The correct answer is **D: Bowyer**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Hamlin is in third place, with 20 points less than Keselowski.
*   The passage also states that Hamlin has five points more than Bowyer.
*   Therefore, Bowyer is in fourth place."
"Kolanda momekano ya mbangu oyo tolobeli na eteni, Kahne azali na bapwe boni na lisano ya batambwisi mutuka?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The passage states: ""Kahne na Truex, Jr. baza na esika ya mitano pe ya motoba, baza na ba point 2 220 pe 2 207.""

"Nakotala na makomi oyo eleki, mbala boni bato bamonaki mabanga oyo kokweya mpe na nsima emonanaki ete eutá na Mars?","The text states: ""Bakanisaka ete eza mbala ya mitano na lisolo ya bato oyo bato bamona eloko oyo eutaka na mars eyei kokwea awa na Mabele."" This translates to: ""It is believed that this is the fifth time in history that people have witnessed something from Mars falling to Earth.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: Mbala mitano (Five times)**
"
"Ndenge tolobeli yango na bokomi, nini ezali solo mpo na mabanga oyo bamonaki ete eutá na mars?","The correct answer is **D: Bazali 34 kati na bango** (There are 34 of them).

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Na kati ya bameteoriste pene ya 24 000 eyebana oyo ekwea na Mabele, kaka pene ya 34 bamona ete euta na mars."" (Among the approximately 24,000 known meteorites that have fallen on Earth, only about 34 have been identified as coming from Mars.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bango nyonso bazwamaki na ntango ya mbula ya mabanga ya sanza ya nsambo** (They were all found during the July meteor shower) is incorrect. The text states only fifteen of the Martian rocks come from the meteor shower of last July (Mabanga misusu oyo emonanaka mingi mpenza te na Mabele, bazoteka yango banda na 11 000 kino 22 500$ US na once moko, elingi koloba eleki talo ya wolo mbala pene ya koleka zomi.)
*   **B: Ezali na bato 24 000 kati na bango** (There are 24,000 of them) is incorrect. 24,000 is the number of meteorites found on Earth in total, not just Martian meteorites.
*   **C: Bazali na motuya ya dolare 11 000$ koleka wolo** (They are worth $11,000 more than gold) is partially correct but not fully representative of the information. The text states that they are sold for $11,000 to $22,500 per ounce, which is more than ten times the price of gold. However, this information pertains to some of the most recently found rocks and not all of the 34."

"
Massa azokaki ntango nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Na ntango ya Grand Prix moko** (During a Grand Prix).

The text says Massa was injured ""nsima ya kosala aksida na lisano ebengami Grand Prix ya Hongrie ya 2009"" (after having an accident during the Grand Prix of Hungary 2009). So it was during a Grand Prix.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, lolenge nini ebongiseli yango ekozala na bopusi likoló na AOL?","The best answer is **C: Motango ya basaleli ya AOL ekobunda na basaleli ya Yahoo mpe Microsoft**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that AOL used to dominate the IM market in the US.**
* **Then it says that AOL lost its independence and dominance.**
* **It also says that the combined user base of Yahoo! and Microsoft's IM services is about the same as AOL's.**

This clearly implies that AOL is now facing competition from Yahoo! and Microsoft for IM users.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Motango ya basaleli ya AOL ekomata mbala mosusu (AOL's user count will probably increase):** The passage doesn't give any indication that AOL's user base will *increase*. In fact, it suggests the opposite – that their dominance has waned.
*   **B: AOL ekozala kopanyi moko kaka oyo ekokobisa nkita ya IM (AOL will be the only company developing the IM economy):** The passage clearly states AOL isn't dominant anymore, so this is false.
*   **D: AOL ekosalelama lisusu te na Etats-Unis (AOL will no longer be used in the United States):** The passage doesn't suggest that AOL will cease to exist in the US. It only suggests its dominance has been challenged.

Therefore, **C** is the most logical conclusion based on the provided text.

Bato boni oyo bakufaki na kobundisa wana bazalaki ba polisi te?,"The correct answer is **C: 0**.

The passage states that two police officers were killed in the attack. It does not specify that any other non-police people were killed in the bombing.
"
Nani ayebisaki motu oyo balobi ete azali na likambo yango?,"The correct answer is **A: Polisi**.

The passage states ""Polisi elobi ete bazokanisa ete Daesh (ISIL) nde moto abimisaki bitumba wana"" which translates to ""Police said that they suspect that Daesh (ISIL) was behind the attack."" This clearly indicates that the police made the statement about who they believe was responsible.
"
"Na ntina ya ndenge ya Florida lokola ekolo molongi-azuaka nionso, nini epesamaki na Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **C: Batindami ya ekolo tuku mitano**.

The text explicitly states: ""Lokola aza etuka oyo elongoka nyonso, Floride apesi mimonisi na ye tuku mitano nyonso na Romney..."" (Because it is a winner-take-all state, Florida awarded all fifty of its delegates to Romney...).
"
"Na kotalela oyo eleki, Gingrich azalaki na pourcentage nini na maponami ya liboso?","The correct answer is **none of the above**. The passage states Gingrich received 32% of the vote in Florida. The provided options all say 50%.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nani balongolaki ye nkombo, na nsima ya baresulta ya caucus?","The correct answer is **B: Bachman**.

The text states that ""Bachmann...azwi ekateli ya kosukisa esakoli na ye."" This translates to Bachmann deciding to end her campaign. Perry also withdrew but not immediately after the caucus, he went back to Texas to ""assess"" the results, and *then* announced his withdrawal. Gingrich and Romney are still mentioned as being active.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nani alobelaki mingi motu mosusu kolandana na résultat ya etuluku?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

The text states: ""Gingrich akumisaki Santorum, kasi alobaki maloba mabe mpona Romney"". This means Gingrich explicitly mentioned both Santorum (positively) and Romney (negatively), making him the one who talked about other candidates the most after the caucus results.
"
Esika kaka moko oyo elakiseli yango ezalaki wapi liboso ya 2015?,"Réponse correcte ezali **A: Radio ya TogiNet**

Explication:

Texte elobi polele ete ""Na ebandeli na yango, emission wana ezalaki kosalema kaka na site Internet ya radio wana ya kala TogiNet Radio..."".  Yango wana liboso ya 2015, emission ezalaki kaka na Radio ya TogiNet.
"
Radio ezali kotalisa masolo kozala na bibabulisi ya ndenge nini?,"Based on the provided passage, the correct answer is **C: Eteyelo ya kala**.

The passage states: ""Site internet ya station elobi ete emission wana eza """"teyatre ya radio ya eteyelo ya kala, na basango ya lokuta pe ezangi ntina!"""" (The website of the station says that the show is ""old-time radio theater, with false and meaningless stories!"")

Therefore, the radio program is described as ""old-time radio theater"" (teyatre ya radio ya eteyelo ya kala).

The passage states: ""Koluka komona pe kozwa basango oyo David Headley asalaki, esalisaki na mosala ya mibali 10 oyo bazalaki na mandoki...""  This translates to ""Reconnaissance and the information gathered by David Headley helped in the operation of the 10 gunmen...""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: Nsango (Information)
"
Motindo nini ya komema babundisi basalelaki mpo na kokende na Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Masuwa** because the passage states ""Bato babomaki bato na Mumbai bakomaki na nzela ya **masuwa** na mokolo ya 26 sanza ya zomi na moko 2008"".

Liloba nini ezali kolakisa malamu mbano ya lisano ya Nadal na Raonic na Brisbane Open oyo tolobeli na bokomi?,"The correct answer is **A: Raonic alongaki Nadal**.

The passage states: ""Kala mingi te balongaki ye na Raonic na Masano ya Brisbane."" This translates to ""He was recently defeated by Raonic at the Brisbane Open."" This clearly indicates Raonic won the match.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, esika ya Nadal na Raonic ezalaki nini nsima ya eteni ya yambo?","The correct answer is **D: Raonic alongaki Nadal**.

The text states: ""Kala mingi te balongaki ye na Raonic na Masano ya Brisbane."" which translates to ""Recently he was defeated by Raonic in the Brisbane Games.""  This directly indicates that Raonic won against Nadal.
"
Nsango na lokota nini ezuami te na bobongisi misato ya sika ya Naked News?,"The correct answer is **C: Jampo jamponais**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Naked News programs are already available in English and Japanese.
*   The passage also says that they are adding programs in Spanish, Italian, and Korean.
*   Therefore, Jampo jamponais (which is a repetition/nonsense) is not a language in which Naked News provides content."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nsango ya sika ya Naked News ekozala te wapi?","Réponse ya malamu ezali: **C: Bisika ya masano**

Lisango ya Naked News ebimisi bilaka mpona televizion, internet pe batelefone ya maboko. Likambo etali bisika ya masano eyebisami te na kati ya makomi."
Bawelani boni basilisaki te Giant Slalom ?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The passage states: ""na mobimba bato ya ski 45 na kati ya 117 na Giant Slalom balongaki te na lisano wana."" (In total, 45 skiers out of 117 in the Giant Slalom did not finish the race).
"
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali komonisa na bosikisiki mbano ya makokima mbangu na masano?","The correct answer is **B: Batu 45 oyo basalaka ski basilisaki te kopota mbangu na bango na Giant Slalom.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""na mobimba bato ya ski 45 na kati ya 117 na Giant Slalom balongaki te na lisano wana"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na momekano ya mbangu ya mibale, Carpenado asilisaki liboso ya mosani moko ya ski oyo autaki na Hongrie** The passage says she was 1:09.02 slower than the Hungarian skier. Therefore, the Hungarian skier finished ahead of her.
*   **C: Bato mingi oyo basalaka ski basilisaki Slalom ya monene koleka Slalom** The passage says 36 people didn't finish Slalom, and 45 didn't finish Giant Slalom. Therefore, more people *did not* finish Giant Slalom than Slalom.
*   **D: Carpenado azwaki esika ya zomi na Slalom** The passage says she *did not finish* (Asilisaki te) Slalom. She finished 10th in Giant Slalom.

Therefore, the only statement accurately reflected in the text is B."
"Na kati ya makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi NBA ezwaki ekateli ya kopekisa?","The correct answer is **A: Eleko ya basketi** (The basketball season).

The passage states that the NBA announced the suspension of the basketball season due to COVID-19 concerns.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ememaki na mitungisi ya NBA mpo na virus?","The correct answer is **D: Mosani moko ya Utah Jazz azwamaki na bokono** (A player from the Utah Jazz was found to be sick).

The passage states directly that the NBA made the decision after a player from the Utah Jazz tested positive for COVID-19.
"
Nani akotisaki but ya kolonga masano mpo na Washington Capitals na lisano na Atlanta Thrashers?,"Correct answer is A: Nicklas Backstrom
"
Nani akotisaki but na ye ya 60 ya eleko na match ya Capitals na Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The text clearly states that Ovechkin scored his 60th goal of the season in that game against the Thrashers.
"
Ntango nini banque ya Northern Rock ezalaki na bosenga ya lisalisi ya gouvernement?,"The correct answer is **D: Na ntango ya mpasi ya lifuti ya mbongo (Na ntango ya mpasi ya lifuti ya mbongo)**.

The text states that Northern Rock needed assistance ""na ntango akendeki na hypothécaires oyo ezali na likama na 2007,"" which translates to ""when it got into risky mortgages in 2007."" This indicates the financial distress, which is the same as mpasi ya lifuti ya mbongo.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola na bosikisiki makambo oyo Virgin Group esalaki na banque ya Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **B: Virgin Group esombaki banque nsima ezonga ya ekolo**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Virgin autaki kaka kosomba 'banke ya malamu' ya Northern Rock, kasi te kompani oyo elandelaka biloko."" This means Virgin bought the ""good bank"" *after* it was nationalized and split.
*   The text states: ""Etuluku Virgin ya Sir Richard Branson azalaki na bosengi ya banke oyo baboyaki liboso banke ekoma ya mboka mobimba.""
*   The text states: ""Na 2010, ntango bakomisaki yango ya mboka mobimba, banke ya sika ya Northern Rock plc ekabwanaka na 'banke ya mabe', Northern Rock (Asset Management).""
*   The text states: ""Virgin autaki kaka kosomba 'banke ya malamu' ya Northern Rock, kasi te kompani oyo elandelaka biloko.""
Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage says Virgin *didn't* buy the asset management company.
*   **C:** The passage doesn't state that Virgin provided emergency support. It says Northern Rock received support from the UK government.
*   **D:** The passage says Virgin's first bid was *before* the bank was nationalized, not after.

Therefore, **B** is the most accurate description of Virgin Group's actions based on the provided text."
Ndenge elobami na bokomi ekolo nini ezali kotungisama na botiami maboko na boyokani ya klima ya Kyoto?,"The correct answer is **A: États Unis**

The passage states that Australia's new Prime Minister Rudd signed the Kyoto Protocol, leaving the United States alone as the only developed nation not to ratify the agreement. Therefore, the US is the nation being singled out and is the one potentially facing pressure or isolation due to this action.
"
Bokonzi ya kala ya Australie ekanisaki ete kondimama ya Kyoto ekosala nini mabe?,"The correct answer is **B: Nkita ya mboka**.

The passage explicitly states the previous conservative government rejected Kyoto because they said it would harm the economy, which relies heavily on coal exports.
"
Ebongeseli nini bazuaki bakangifoto mpo na yangompo nampo na?,"The correct answer is **C: Ebongeseli ya NPWS**.

The passage states ""Na boyokani moko kati ya NPWS na Sporting Shooters Association ya Australie (NSW) Inc, bazwaki bato ya bolingo malamu babongi mpona kobengama bato na Sporting Shooters Association.""  This indicates a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association, with NPWS playing a key role. Further, Mick O'Flynn, the Director of *NPWS*, confirmed the training.

Let's eliminate the other options:

*   **A: Ebongeseli ya lisanga ya bakangifotoya masano ya Australie:** While the ""Sporting Shooters Association"" is mentioned, the question asks *which organization recruited* the shooters.
*   **B: Ebongeseli ya bobateli mpe bomengo ya parc:** This is a general description and not a specific organization that recruited the shooters. While NPWS *is* involved in conservation, the passage directly links them to the recruitment and training.
*   **D: Ebongeseli ya kobundisa banyama ya Sporting Shooters Association:** While the shooters are members of this organization, the passage specifies the collaboration with NPWS and NPWS's director confirming the training.
"
Liloba nini ezali komonisa na bosikisiki te momekano ya kopekisa banyama mabe?,"Eyano ya malamu ezali **A: Lokola ezalaki momekano ya liboso ya ebongeseli yango, batalelaki yango te**.

Mpo na nini:

*   Lisolo elobi polele ete bakengeli bazalaki kolandela likambo wana pe kotala soki ekosimba. Yango elakisi ete bazalaki kotalela yango mpe koyeba soki ezali kosala mosala.
*   Biteni mosusu (B, C, na D) nyonso endimami na lisolo. Bato oyo babetaki masasi bazwaki formasion, bazalaki na bakengeli, pe bato minei nde baponamaki.

Na yango, A nde eyano oyo ezali komonisa na bosikisiki te likambo oyo lisolo elobi."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, wapi bokabwani ezwamaki?","The correct answer is **A: Na Rift Valley** and **D: Na Éthiopie**.

The passage directly mentions ""Rift Valley Research Service na Ethiopie"" as the location of the research and the person speaking. So both locations are relevant to where the discovery was made. While the discovery relates to the timing of divergence based on molecular evidence, the *place* of the research is the Rift Valley in Ethiopia.
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, nini elobami te lokola eloko ekoki kotinda banyama ya zamba basala yo mabe?","The correct answer is **D: Bolukiluki oyo esalemaki na Rift Valley**.

The passage discusses how studying the artifacts suggests divergence began earlier than previously thought based on molecular evidence. This implies that:

*   **A: Bokutani ya biloko ya kala (Encountering artifacts)** is relevant as it's the basis of the new timeline.
*   **B: Bokabwani yango (That divergence)** is relevant as it's the main topic.
*   **C: Botaleli ya bilembeteli moléculaires (Considering molecular evidence)** is relevant as it's the old baseline for divergence.

The research service itself, while mentioned as the source of the statement, is not presented as something that could provoke wildlife. The focus is on the *findings* of that research."
Nini ekosenga mosani asala mpo na kosala muvema na ntango ya lisano ya vidéo?,"The correct answer is **D: Tambolisa oyo ezolanda na kati ya mopepe** (Move the tracker in the air).

The passage states that players will be able to control actions and navigate video games by waving the controller in the air (""na kolekisa eloko wana na mopepe""). The controller is the ""oyo ezolanda"" (tracker).
"
Nini esalemaki mpo ezala lokola télécommande ya v?,"The correct answer is **D: Console ya Révolution ya Nintendo**

The passage states: ""Controleur eza ndenge moko na télécommande ya televizio..."". This translates to ""The controller is similar to a TV remote..."".  The passage refers to this controller as being for the Nintendo Revolution console.
"
Nini elobamaki te na rapport ya sika ya biro ya sango Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **B: Mpepo yango ekitanaki na Ürümqi**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states that initially Xinhua reported a plane hijacking. Later reports clarified that there was a bomb threat that forced the plane to return to Afghanistan, landing in Kandahar. The older reports mentioned the plane was diverted back to Afghanistan because it wasn't allowed to land in Ürümqi.

*   The updated Xinhua report (based on the passage) only mentions the bomb threat and the landing in Kandahar. It does *not* mention that the plane successfully landed in Ürümqi; in fact, the original report suggested they were denied landing there.

The other options are all mentioned, either in the initial or updated Xinhua reports described in the text:
*   A is implied.
*   C is implied.
*   D is implied."
Nini elobamaki te na rapport ya liboso ya biro ya sika ya Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **D: Mpepo yango ezwaki likama ya kobwaka bombe** (The plane was threatened with a bomb).

Here's why:

*   **P says**: ""Liboso lisanga ya Chine ya kopanza-basango Xinhua balobaki ete bakangi mpepo moko"" (""Initially, the Chinese news agency Xinhua said that a plane had been hijacked"").
*   **P Also Says**: ""Barapore ya nsima emonisi ete babangisaka mpepo ete bakobeta yango bombe"" (""Later reports indicate that the plane was threatened with a bomb"")

The initial report (the one from Xinhua that the question refers to) mentioned a hijacking but did *not* mention the bomb threat. The bomb threat came in *later* reports. The other options were all mentioned in some form in the initial report as a Hijacking."
Nini esakolamaki na Sara Danius na ntango ya programme ya radio?,"The correct answer is **D: Komite ekotika milende mpo na kosala boyokani na Bob Dylan**.

Sara Danius specifically stated they were stopping efforts to contact Bob Dylan. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Molongi ya Prix Nobel ya bokomi:** The passage is about *informing* the winner, not announcing who it is (that was already known).
*   **B: Komite yango ezwi biyano moko te epai ya basalani:** The passage says they *did* receive some replies from Dylan's associates (""nazwi biyano ya malamu mpenza"").
*   **C: Bato oyo bampo nampo namaki mpo na kozwa mbano ya Nobel na makambo ya mikanda na 2016:** This is not mentioned.

Therefore, D is the only option that accurately reflects what Danius said.
"
Nani akokaki te kokutana na ye?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.

The passage states that Sara Danius ""azokoka te kosolola na Bob Dylan"" (could not get in touch with Bob Dylan). Therefore, Bob Dylan could not be reached.
"
Nani alobaki ete elaka yango ezali “litambe monene”?,"The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

The text clearly states: ""Molobeli ya Bush, Gordon Johndroe, abengaki komipesa ya Corée ya nordi """"etambe monene..."""" "" (Bush's spokesperson, Gordon Johndroe, called North Korea's commitment a ""major step..."")
"
Słania ebimisaki batimbre boni mpo na bikolo mingi?,"The passage states: ""Asalaki batimbre koleka 1 000 mpona Suède na mikili 28 mosusu."" This translates to ""He made more than 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: koleka 1000** (more than 1000).
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekoki kozala ntina ya kokoba kotanga uta na bisika ya kopelisa mopepe ya batono?","The correct answer is **A: Esika ya bokangami ya mibale oyo ezali kotondisama na makoki**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the seals on the tank are still leaking fluid.
*   It also mentions a secondary containment area that isn't yet full.

The combination of these two facts strongly suggests that the reason for continued venting is the secondary containment area filling up as the primary tank leaks. The other options are not directly supported by the text."
Mpo na nini bisika ya kokanga efungwamaki?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Ezalaki bozangi ya lotiliki nsima ya komeka yango.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Panne ya courant oyo esalemaki ntango bazalaki komeka ebongiseli ya koboma moto, efungolaka basoupape ya libateli mpe essence ebimaki na pompe ya essence ya Fort Greely 9."" This translates to: ""A power outage that occurred while testing the fire extinguishing system opened the safety valves and oil escaped from the Fort Greely 9 pump station.""

Therefore, the opening of the safety valves (which led to the oil spill) was directly caused by a power outage.
"
"Sikawa, mai ezali likoló boni na The Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **C: Ekómaka tii na loketo**.

The passage states: ""Ndako ya libwa, oyo mai ekotelaka yango kino na 20 feet na ntango ya mopepe makasi Katrina, eza sikoyo na mai kino na loketo po mwa libulu ya mai ya pene etondaki mpenza."" This clearly indicates that the water level in the Ninth Ward is now up to the waist (loketo).
"
"Na ntango ya mopɛpɛ makasi Katrina, nini esalemaki na The Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **C: Mai ya mpela ezalaki na bolai ya metre 20**.

The passage states: ""Ndako ya libwa, oyo mai ekotelaka yango kino na 20 feet na ntango ya mopepe makasi Katrina..."" which translates to ""The Ninth Ward, which had water levels up to 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina...""

While the other options are mentioned in the passage, they are not directly related to what happened in the Ninth Ward during Hurricane Katrina.
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi endimisamaki te na Hamilton?","Eyano ya malamu ezali **D: Ezalela ya mobeli ya lelo**.

Lisolo ya Hamilton ezali kolobela ndenge mobeli azalaki mwa malamu ntango akomaki na lopitalo. Lisolo ezali kolobela te ezalela na ye ya lelo.

Na mosusu, lisolo yango ezali kosimba makambo matali A, B, mpe C:
*   **A: Esika oyo mobeli yango asalaki mobembo:** Lisolo elobi ete mobeli azalaki na Nigeria.
*   **B: Likoki ya kozwa mobeli mosusu na virus:** Lisolo elobi ete lopitalo etosaki mibeko ya kobatela mpe kokabola bato ya maladi.
*   **C: Soki mokanda ya kosala elandamaki:** Lisolo elobi ete lopitalo etosaki mibeko ya kobatela.

Yango wana, eyano ya malamu ezali D.
"
Nini ezali likambo oyo batu ya siansi balingi koyeba?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndenge nini Mabele esalemaki** (How the Earth was formed).

The passage explicitly states that scientists are trying to understand how planets, especially Earth, formed.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, mosala nini bapolisi ya mboka basalaki na bokangami?","Eyano ya malamu ezali **C: Bazalaki kotambwisa bato oyo bazalaki kotambwisa mituka na banzela mosusu**.

Explanation:

*   Lisolo elobi polele ete bapolisi 80 basalisaki na koyeba bashofere ya bamoto baleka na nzela mosusu. Yango emonisi ete bazalaki kotambwisa bato oyo bazalaki kotambwisa mituka na banzela mosusu."
Nini esalemaki na esika ya kokotisa tiyo ntango ya bokangami?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **B: Bazalaki kosalela yango lokola nzela ya kopengwisa**.

The text says ""Mituka oyo ebendaka biloko basalelaki yango mpona kokanga nzela ya kokotela mpe bapolisi 80 basalisaka na koyeba bashofere ya bamoto baleka na nzela mosusu."" This indicates that the entrances/access points were blocked with trucks, and police were diverting traffic elsewhere. Therefore, they were used as detour routes.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini esalemaki te liboso ete motuka ebeta moto oyo akangaki fotó?","The correct answer is **D: Moto oyo azwaki bafoto yango alongaki kozwa fotó ya Bieber**

The text describes the events leading up to the accident: the photographer parked his car, attempted to photograph a police station, and was told to return to the other side of the road by a police officer. The text doesn't mention that the photographer successfully took any pictures of Justin Bieber before the accident.
"
Mokangami ya bafoto azalaki komeka kosala nini liboso ete motuka ebɛta ye?,"The correct answer is **B: Bokanga bafot ya esika ya kotelema ya polisi**

The passage states ""moto akangaka bafoto atelemisaki motuka na ye na ngambo oyo mosusu ya balabala Sepulveda pe alukaki kokanga bafoto ya biro ya bapolisi"" which translates to ""the photographer stopped his car on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard and tried to take pictures of the police station.""
"
Liloba nini ezali kolimbola na bosikisiki te ezalela ya ndenge ya mokambi ya ekolo azuaki nsima na kozwama na virus?,"The correct answer is **A: Azali koyoka malamu te**

Here's why:

* The text says Arias (the president) ""azalaki na virisi ya moke"" (had a mild virus), had a fever, and throat pain. This clearly indicates he is not feeling well.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **B: Azali na mpasi na zolo** The text only mentions having throat pain
*   **C: Azali kotungisama teetat stable:** It is a distractor to confuse you
*   **D: Azali na nzoto moto** The text says he has a fever, which is related to the body being hot, but it is not specifically mentioned

Therefore, ""Azali koyoka malamu te"" (He is not feeling well) is the most accurate description based on the provided text.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, maloba oyo elandi na ntinan oyo etali président, oyo wapi ezali ya solo?","Let's analyze each option based on the provided text:

*   **A: Azali na nzoto moto te (He does not have a fever)** - The text says ""...Longola fievre na mongongo mpasi, naza malamu..."" (""Except for a fever and sore throat, I am well...""). So, this statement is FALSE.
*   **B: Akotikala na ndako na boumeli ya bapɔsɔ mingi (He will stay home for many weeks)** - The text says ""...akomifandela na ndako na ye moko mpona mikolo mawa mingi..."" (""...he will isolate at home for a few days...""). This statement is FALSE.
*   **C: Azali malamu mpo na kosala mosala na ye na mosika (He is well enough to work remotely)** - The text states ""...nakoki kosala mosala na ngai na mosika"" (""...I can do my work remotely""). So, this statement is TRUE.
*   **D: Azali na ndenge moko ya makasi ya virus (He has a severe form of the virus)** - The text says ""...azalaki na virisi ya moke..."" (""...he had a mild virus...""). This statement is FALSE.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango nini mopepe makasi Gonu esengelaki kokoba kolɛmba?","The correct answer is **B: Ntango mipepe ekitanaki tii na kilomɛtrɛ soki 83 na ngonga moko**.

The passage states that ""Lelo na ntongo makasi, mopepe ezalaki pene ya 83 km/h, mpe tozalaki kozela ekoba kolemba."" This directly indicates that the weakening was expected to occur when the wind speed reached approximately 83 km/h.
"
Mipepe ezalaki mbangu ndenge nini na nsɔngɛ ya mopepe makasi Gonu?,"The correct answer is **C: 149 miles par heure**.

The passage states that Cyclone Gonu reached peak speeds of 240 kilometers per hour (149 miles per hour).
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi etalelami te lokola ezaleli ya Karenia brevis?","The correct answer is **C: Ezali na ba cellules ebele** (It has many cells).

The passage explicitly states that Karenia brevis is ""eloko moko ya nse ya mai oyo ezalaka na selile moko"" (a single-celled aquatic organism). Therefore, the characteristic of having many cells is NOT a characteristic of Karenia brevis. The other options are all mentioned as characteristics in the provided text.
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi Karena brevis azali na makoki ya kosala te?","Esengeli mpenza na biso tótalela lisusu makambo oyo toyekolaki na eteni ya liboso mpo na koyanola na motuna oyo. P epesi ete:

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi esalemaki te mpo na mopɛpɛ makasi Félicia?","The correct answer is **D: Mpela ya balabala**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions ""no reported damage or flooding there"" in the islands affected by Felicia. Therefore, street flooding (mpela ya balabala) was not reported.
*   The passage states, ""Its remnants brought some rain to many islands..."", so A (Mbula ya litomba - beneficial rain) occurred.
*   The passage says ""Some rain showers are with thunder and sometimes with lightning,"" so B (Mbula ebetaka elongo na nkake - rain with thunder) and C (Nkake oyo ezongaka mbala na mbala - frequent lightning) occurred."
Maloba nini oyo elobeli mopepe makasi Felicia ezali lokuta?,"Response B is the lie.

Here is why:
*   **P mentions Felicia used to be Category 4. It became a tropical depression only after it weakened.**

The rest are true:
*   **A:** P says there were ""no reports of significant damage or flooding."" This implies the impacts were relatively minor (not necessarily beneficial, but not significantly harmful).
*   **C:** P mentions ""some rain on several islands.""
*   **D:** P mentions ""some rainfall had thunder."""

The text says: ""Engumba wana ekozala engumba ya liboso ya Eropa ya sudi este na koyamba masano CowParade, **molulu ya art eleki monene na mokili mobimba**..."" (The city will be the first in Southeastern Europe to host CowParade, **the largest public art event in the world**...).

This makes option D the most accurate explanation of CowParade based on the given text.
"
Nini esalaki ete Russie etelemisa kosalela ba avions II-76?,"The correct answer is **B: Likama moko** (An accident).

The text states that Russia temporarily grounded Il-76 aircraft after an engine failure on October 7th. This engine failure is the ""likama moko"" (an accident) that caused the grounding.
"
II-76 ezali nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Mpepo moko** (A plane).

The passage explicitly states ""Il-76 eza eteni moko ya ntina mingi ya mampinga ya Russie pe ya Union Sovietique banda na mibu 1970, pe esi esala aksida ya maksi na Russie na sanza eleki."" (Il-76 is an important part of the Russian and Soviet Union's military since the 1970s, and it was involved in a near accident in Russia last month.) This clearly indicates that the Il-76 is a type of plane.
"
Nani azwaki ekipi ya bakomi mpo na The Simpsons?,"The correct answer is **B: Simon**.

The passage states: ""Na 1989, asalisaki na kosala Simpsons elongo na Brooks pe Groening, mpe ye moto azwaki na mosala ekipe ya liboso oyo bazalaki kokoma basango."" which translates to ""In 1989, he helped create the Simpsons along with Brooks and Groening, and he was the one who hired the first team of writers.""
"
"Engebene Fluke, nani azalaki kotindela ye makanisi ya malamu mpe kolendisa ye?","The correct answer is **D: Nyoso mibali na basi**.

The text clearly states: ""bakomantere mingi ya malamu mpe bilendiseli batindelaki ye na **basi pe mibali**"" which translates to ""many positive comments and encouragements sent to her by **women and men**"".
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, bato mosusu balingaki te basi baloba na ntina na nini?","The correct answer is **C: Bokolongono ya basi**.

The passage clearly states that some people are trying to prevent women from talking about their health (""Fluke akomaki ete milende bato mosusu bazosala mpona kokanga basi nzela balobela te kolongono ya nzoto ya basi elongi te"").
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nzoto nini ya planɛti ezali na nguya mingi?","The correct answer is **A: Mabele**.

The passage states ""Na ndenge toyebeli, eza kaka na nzoto moko oyo elakisaka makasi mingi koleka Titan, pe nkombo na yango eza Mabele,"" which translates to ""As far as we know, there is only one body that displays more strength than Titan, and its name is Earth."" This clearly indicates Earth has more strength than Titan according to the passage.
"
Bibale mpe mabeke oyo ezali na mai oyo ezali polele emonisami na nzoto nini ya planeti?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Eza lokola talatala kaka ndenge mai ezali"" meaning that the body has the attributes of water on its surface, like mirrors.
*   The passage says: ""Na ndenge toyebeli, eza kaka na nzoto moko oyo elakisaka makasi mingi koleka Titan"" which means that Titan has clear lakes and oceans.

Therefore, Titan is the body with clear lakes and seas."
Nini kati na makambo oyo bamoni ezali te mbuma ya bokutani ya nsala?,"The correct answer is **D: Bondimami été Confirmation que badinosaure mingi bazalaki na nsala** (Confirmation that many dinosaurs had feathers).

The passage states that the discovery *confirms* the widely held belief that some dinosaurs had feathers. Therefore, it's not a *result* of the feather findings, but rather a pre-existing idea that is supported by the findings.  The other options are all discoveries or understandings gained *from* examining the feathers.
"
Nsala ya dinosaure ezalaki na nini te?,"According to the passage, the research suggests the dinosaur's feathers resembled an adult dinosaur's feathers, *not* a juvenile's. Therefore, the answer is (C) Nsala ya mikolo (adult feathers).  The passage states they found evidence of red coloring, and mentions barbules and feathers as being components.

"Na ba affirmations oyo elandi mpo na ZMapp, oyo wapi ezali ya solo te?","Eyano ya solo ezali:

**A: Esalemi na ba anticorps**

Lisolo epesi te soki ZMapp esalemi na ba anticorps to te. Ba affirmations mosusu nyonso (B, C, pe D) ezali ya solo, balobeli yango polele na lisolo.
"
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola na bosikisiki bomekoli ya PALM?","The correct answer is **B: Bakokanisaki nkisi moko ya témoin na ba traitements misato mosusu, moko na yango ezalaki ZMapp.**

Here's why:

*   The text says: ""Na ntango ya komeka PALM, ZMapp esalisaki na kolandela, elimboli ete bato ya sinasi basalelaki yango lokola modele pe bakokanisaki bikisi misato mosusu.""

*   This means ZMapp was used as a baseline/model to compare three other drugs against it in the PALM trial. This makes option B the most accurate description. The use of a model to compare other drugs against is a similar meaning to having a control.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bolukiluki yango emonisaki ete ekoki kozala na matomba mingi koleka ndenge bakanisaki liboso:** The passage doesn't say the trial showed ZMapp was *more* beneficial than initially thought.
*   **C: ZMapp esalelamaki lokola base ya trial’s:** This is close, but ""base"" is a bit vague. Option B is more precise in explaining the comparison.
*   **D: Emonanaki ete ezali malamu mpo na kosalisa maladi oyo ezalaki:** The passage focuses on using ZMapp as a comparison point, not necessarily demonstrating its effectiveness.

**Therefore, option B is the best and most accurate description of the PALM trial based on the provided text.**"
Balukiluki bakanisi ete wapi puce ya sika ekozala na ntina mingi?,"The correct answer is **A: Bikolo oyo ezali na mbongo mingi te**.

The passage explicitly states that the researchers believe this device will be useful in helping people in **poor countries** (""mikili ya bobola"") where survival rates for diseases like breast cancer are much lower.
"
Nzela nini ekosalelama mpo na kotonga esaleli ya koyeba malali?,"The correct answer is **B: Masini ya kobeta mikanda oyo endimami inkjet**.

The passage states that the device is made ""na lisalisi ya ba imprimantes à jet ya encre,"" which translates to ""with the help of inkjet printers."" Therefore, inkjet printers are used to build the device.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, maloba nini oyo elobeli biteni ya libende ya lobate ezali solo te?","Maloba oyo ezali solo te na kati ya maloba oyo epesami ezali:

**D: Ezalaki na yango mingi te oyo ezwamaki na likoló ya sanza**

Polojɛ oyo elobi ete bamonaki bisika ya mabulumabulu mingi na sanza (Bamonaki bisika ya bongo na bisika mingi na sanza).  Yango wana, koloba ete ezalaká mingi te ezali solo te.  Bapanzi nsango mosusu nyonso ezali kokokana na polojɛ oyo epesami.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, liteya nini na ntina na lolenge ya mabelé emonisi ete ezali na mosala ya géologie oyo ezali kosalema na sanza?","The correct answer is **D: Ndenge ya mabele esalamaki kala mingi te**.

Here's why:

* **P says:** The new surface features (lobate scarps) appear relatively undisturbed, suggesting they formed recently.
* **Q asks:** What geological implication does the landform suggest?
* **D (Ndenge ya mabele esalamaki kala mingi te - The landforms formed relatively recently)** Directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are not correct:

*   **A: Sanza ezali kokita mokemoke (The moon is shrinking slightly)** The passage states that lobate scarps show the moon is contracting, but this is a cause of the landform, not an implication of it.
*   **B: Ndenge ya mabele esalemaki kala mingi te (The landforms were formed a long time ago)** This statement contradicts the passage.
*   **C: Ezali kaka na mwa ndambo moke ya biloko oyo ezali na likoló ya sanza (There are only a few small amounts of material on the surface of the moon)** This is not mentioned in the passage.

**Therefore, option D is the most accurate inference based on the information provided in paragraph P.**
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekozala mingi te ya kino na bofundami?","Eyano ya malamu ezali **C: Masolo ya bilembeteli ya ba témoins miso**.

Polo eleki elobi ete Biro ya Motole eyebisaki bapanzi-sango ete bakoloba lisusu likambo moko te *kino* bakofunda likambo. Yango elingi koloba ete, kino na bofundami, bayebisi bango ete bátika koloba, na ntina na masolo ya bilembeteli ya batemwe, mpamba te foto ya moto oyo akangami epalangani bisika mingi mpenza. Yango wana, A, B, na D ekokani te na ndimbola ya polo, mpamba te maloba ya Biro ya Motole epekisi masolo ya sika ya bilembeteli ya batemwe.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ezali mokakatano ya lelo te mpo na batu oyo batyaka bilembo?","The correct answer is **D: Glace oyo ezali konyangwa (Ice that is melting)**.

Here's why:

* **A: Ndenge ya mopepe ya makasi (Strong wind conditions)** is directly mentioned as hindering rescue efforts.
* **B: Motango ya glace (Amount of ice)** is implied in the passage when it talks about the ""mingi mpe monene ya glace wana"" (the much and great ice).
* **C: Monene ya glace (Size of ice)** is explicitly mentioned as a major problem for those on boats.

The passage describes a situation worsened by existing ice, not a situation of ice actively melting and causing problems (although melting might eventually *cause* problems, that's not the *immediate* issue). The problem is the amount and size of the existing ice preventing rescue.
"
"Longola glace, nini mosusu ezali kotungisa milende ya kobikisa bato?","The correct answer is **B: Ezalela ya météo (The weather conditions)**.

The passage clearly states that ""makambo mabe ya mopepe ebebisi makasi mosala ya kobikisa bato"" which translates to ""bad weather conditions are severely hampering rescue efforts"". The passage also mentions the ice, but the weather is presented as the direct and immediate obstacle to the rescue.
"
bindimeli nini Roberts aboyaki kondimisa yango?,"Polo na maloba ya lisolo, Roberts aboyaki kondimisa **C: Ebandeli ya bomoi**. Alobaki ete ekozala malamu te alobela makambo ya kesi na kesi na motuna wana, oyo ezali likambo ya ntina mingi na kotala likambo ya kolongola zemi.

Polozi elobi ete Roberts alobaki ekozala malamu te ""alobela makambo ya kesi na kesi.""  ""Kesi na kesi"" elingi koloba ""makambo ya sikisiki ya makambo.""
"
Banzete mibale ya pole ezali kongenga wapi?,"The correct answer is **A: Epai ya likolo**.

The passage states: ""Batie banzete mibale ya pole mpo etalaka na likolo na butu."" (They put two beams of light so they shine to the sky at night.)
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango nini bandako milai ya sika ezali kotongama na esika yango?","The correct answer is **D: Botongi yango ezali kokoba**.

The text states that ""Bazotonga bandako milai mitano ya sika na esika wana..."" which means ""They are building five new skyscrapers in that place..."".  This indicates an ongoing process.
"
Makambo nini emonisi ete Bandeko Sambo bazali mabulu?,"The correct answers are A and B.

*   **A: Bokeseni ya molunge (Bokeseni ya molunge)** - The passage specifically mentions infrared images showing temperature variations between day and night, indicating the holes are colder than surrounding areas during the day and warmer at night. This is a key piece of evidence.

*   **B: Diamètre ya esika ya kokota namabulu (Diamètre ya esika ya kokota namabulu)** - The passage states the entrances of the ""Seven Sisters"" are large, measuring approximately 100 to 250 meters. The passage also mentions the entrance is a cave.

Let's look at why C and D are wrong:

*   **C: Boluki ya mabele (Boluki ya mabele)** - While the thermal behavior suggests the presence of possible lava tubes, the passage doesn't detail ""ground searches."" It discusses interpretation of infrared imagery and comparison to Earth caves.
*   **D: Bililingi ya mabulu na Mabelé (Bililingi ya mabulu na Mabelé)** - While the team compares the phenomenon with holes on Earth, the focus is on the difference between temperatures.
"
Ndenge nini bizaleli ya molunge ya Bandeko basi Sambo emonanaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Bililingi ya infrarouge**.

The passage states: ""Bilili ya infrarouges ezomonisa bambongwana ya temperature na kati ya butu pe moi, emonisi ete mbala mosusu eza libulu."" This clearly indicates that infrared imaging is used to observe the thermal properties of the Seven Sisters.
"
"Kolandana na bokomi, maloba nini nan tina na motu bazokanisa ezali ya solo te?","The correct answer is **C: Ekolo na ye eyebani na bakonzi** and **D: Azokaki te**.

Here's why:

*   The passage clearly states, ""nkombo na ye eyebani kaka te na bakonzi, atako bayebi ete aza moto ya ekolo ya Uighur."" This means his nationality (Uighur) is known, so **C** is incorrect.

*   The passage states that he was arrested after being wounded by the bomb (""Moto oyo bakanisi ete abwakaki bombe, bakangaki ye, nsima ya kozoka na bombe wana."") this means he was wounded, so **D** is incorrect."
Nsango nini etali kobunda bakonzi bandimisi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ekolo ya motu bazokanisa**.

The text states: ""bayebi ete aza moto ya ekolo ya Uighur"" which means they know the person's nationality.
"
Ekipe nini ekobeta na match na Ellis Park?,"Eyano ya malamu ezali C: Afrika ya Sudi mpe Australie.

Lisolo elobi polele ete match oyo ekosalema na Ellis Park ekobetama kati na Springboks (ekipe ya rugby ya Afrika ya Sudi) mpe Australie.
"
Springboks ekobeta lisano na bango ya nsima wapi?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The passage states: ""Match ya suka ya eleko wana ekobetama na Ellis Park na Johannesburg na poso ezoya, ntango Springboks ekobeta na Australie.""  This translates to: ""The last match of that season will be played at Ellis Park in Johannesburg next week, when the Springboks will play Australia.""  Therefore, Johannesburg is where the Springboks will play their next game.
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi esika nini ezwaki mokakatano na yango na boumeli ya mosala?","The correct answer is **B: Kobatela gyroscope**.

The text clearly states that the station ""babungisaki gyroscope moko na ebandeli na mosala moko ya kokende likolo,"" which means they lost a gyroscope at the beginning of a spacewalk. The other options are related to the text but are not the initial problem encountered during the spacewalk.
"
"Kolandana na bokomi, mokano ya saba ya esika ya mosala ezalaki nini?","The correct answer is **C: Kosilisa esika ya kotambola** (Completing a spacewalk).

The passage states that despite losing a gyroscope early in a spacewalk, the station was able to *finish* the spacewalk (""kino na suka ya kobima na likolo""). This implies the primary goal was to complete the spacewalk. The other options are related to problems encountered *during* the spacewalk, but not the overall objective.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, , oyo wapi ezali ya solo te?","The correct answer is **D: Bazalaki kofunda AOL**.

Here's why:

*   **P** says ""kompani oyo efundaki makambo wana"" (the company that filed the lawsuit), meaning AOL was the *plaintiff* (the one suing), not the defendant (the one being sued).
*   The other options are all explicitly stated or strongly implied in statement P."
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobeli likambo yango na bosikisiki?","The correct answer is **D: AOL nde ebandaki kofunda likambo yango** (AOL is the one who initiated the legal action).

The passage states that AOL, an internet company based in Virginia, *efundaki makambo wana* (filed the lawsuit).  Therefore, option D accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: AOL afundamaki mpo na kokabola biloko oyo basɛngaki te** (AOL was sued for distributing unsolicited goods): The passage says AOL *initiated* the lawsuit, not that they were sued.
*   **B: Likambo yango etali ba fournisseurs mibale ya liboso ya mosala ya internet** (The case involves the two leading internet service providers): The passage only mentions AOL.
*   **C: Likambo yango etalemaki na 2003** (The case was dealt with in 2003): The passage says the *law* used was passed in 2003, not that the case itself happened then. The case is happening *now* (relative to when the original text was written).
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, club nini Vidal abandaki kobeta mpo bitelo misato eleki?","The correct answer is **A: Seville**.

The text says that Vidal came to Barça from Seville. The question asks where he played *before* coming to Barça, which was Seville.
"
Vidal asali masano boni na Barça?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**

The passage states that Vidal has played 49 matches for Barcelona since he arrived.
"
Ekipe nini ebetaki na bango na masano wana?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia** (Bologne).

The passage states: ""Azalaki kofanda na hotel ya ekipe na bango liboso ya match oyo bakobeta na Bologne na mokolo ya Lomingo."" This translates to ""He was staying at his team's hotel before the match they would play against Bologne on Sunday.""
"
Mpo na nini Jarque azalaki kofanda na otele yango?,"The correct answer is **C: Azalaki na match moko dimanche** (He had a match on Sunday).

The text states: ""Azalaki kofanda na hotel ya ekipe na bango liboso ya match oyo bakobeta na Bologne na mokolo ya Lomingo."" (He was staying at his team's hotel before the match they would play in Bologna on Sunday). This directly implies the reason he was there was because of the Sunday match.
"
Mpo na nini biro ya géophysique ya Jakarta ekopesa likebisi te?,"The correct answer is **D: Ekokisaki te bonene oyo esengelaki mpo na koningana ya mabele**.

The passage states: ""...likebisi moko te ya tsunami ekopesama mpo koningana moko te ekokisaki masengami ya 6,5."" This directly translates to a tsunami warning was not issued because the earthquake did not meet the requirement of 6.5 magnitude.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki,  koningana ya mabele yango esalaki nini?","The correct answer is **A: Bato ya mboka oyo babangaki**.

The passage states that even though there was no tsunami warning, people panicked and evacuated.
"
"Na kati ya minzoto yango, oyo wapi etindaka moi mpe minzoto mosusu nyonso esalaka mosala?","The correct answer is **C: Kobalukabaluka mpe kongenga**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Mosala ya minzoto nyonso na ebongiseli wana etambwisamaka na pole na bango, na kobaluka na bango, pe na eloko mosusu te."" This directly translates to the work of all stars in that system is governed by their light, their rotation, and nothing else. The text equates ""pole"" with ""kongenga"" (brightness/light) and ""kobalka"" with ""kobalukabaluka"" (rotation).

Therefore, the brightness (kongenga) and rotation (kobalukabaluka) are the factors that determine the activity of stars."
Ndenge nini bayebaka motángo ya Rossby ya monzoto moko?,"The correct answer is **A: Kongenga mpe kobalukabaluka**.

The passage states: ""Pole pe kobaluka, basalelaka yango elongo mpona koyeba motango ya minzoto Rossby..."" which translates to ""Light and rotation, they use it together to determine the Rossby number of stars...""

Yango wana, komite ya moke ya bokengeli mpe ya bolukiluki nde eza kosala bolukiluki ya mibeko.
"
Cliff Stearns azali mokambi ya komite nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Komite ya moke ya bokengeli mpe ya bolukiluki**

The passage states ""...ebongiseli Planned Parenthood oyo eza na mokumba ya molandi ya president na komite moke ya kokengela pe kolandela..."". This directly translates to Planned Parenthood being led by the president of the subcommittee on oversight and investigations, which Cliff Stearns is a part of."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekomelaki mwasi yango ya Suisse te?","The correct answer is **B: Babomaki ye**.

"
"Kolandana na bokomi, nani abimisaki mokanda ya kosenga bolimbisi mpo na mikanda oyo ebungaki?","The correct answer is **D: Biro ya poste ya Obanazawa**.

The text states: ""Lobi, biro ya poste esengaki bolimbisi na bato na bango pe na bapanzi-sango..."" which translates to ""Yesterday, the post office apologized to its citizens and the media...""
"
Tango nini Del Potro asengelaki kotalela likambo na ye ya lipeka?,"According to the passage, Del Potro received treatment for his shoulder ""from that hour forward"" *after* reaching 6-6 in the second set.  Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Ntango ya eteni ya mibale (During the second set)**.
"
Oyo euti na kopema ya liboso liboso ezalaki nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Ebungaki na Murray na eteni ya yambo** (Lost by Murray in the first set).

The passage states ""Murray alongaki te ne set ya liboso"" which translates to ""Murray did not win the first set."" This implies he lost the first set.
"
"Ndenge elobami na bokomi, nani, mpenza mpenza, akutanaki na mobɛli moko?","The correct answer is **D: Bana ya mboka**

Because the text stated: ""Lelo, toyebi ete bana-kelasi mosusu ya biteyelo ya bana bakutanaki na moto moko ya maladi."" And ""bana-kelasi mosusu ya biteyelo ya bana"" translates to ""Some school children"" and children are citizens.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki,  endimiseli nini gouverneur apesaki te ntango azalaki koloba na bana mboka ya Texas?","The correct answer is **D: Likambo yango ezali monene te**.

The governor *did* say: ""Likambo oyo eza ya monene."" (This problem is big/serious). Therefore, he did *not* give the assurance that the problem wasn't serious. All the other options were stated by the governor.
"
Esika nini ya parodie ya nsango esalemaki na bayekoli bale ya kala ya UW?,"The correct answer is **D: Litungulu (Onion)**.

It doesn't mention any film production."

"
Nini ezali solo mpo na bolukiluki oyo monganga Ehud Ur asalaki?,"The correct answer is **B: Ba mpuku mosusu oyo bazalaki na diabɛti liboso bazali lisusu na diabete te** (Some mice that previously had diabetes no longer have diabetes).

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Toza sikoyo na mpuku moko ya basanza 4 oyo eza te na diabete kasi ezalaki naino na diabete,"". This means some mice, previously diabetic, are now no longer diabetic.
*   The passage also reports that Dr. Ur's research is in its early stages and its application for people with Type 1 Diabetes is currently irrelevant.

The other options are incorrect:

*   A: Dr. Ur explicitly states the opposite.
*   C: He does not express optimism about finding a cure.
*   D: The study involves mice, not chickens."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, monganga Ur azali na ntembe mpo na nini?","The correct answer is **A: Soki makambo oyo bamoni ezali na ntina mpo na bato oyo bazali na diabète ya Type 1** (Whether the findings are relevant to people with Type 1 diabetes).

"
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola malamu te likama ya Vol CG4684?","The correct answer is **C: Mpepo yango emekaki kokita mbala misato liboso ekwea**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Twin Otter *tried* to land in Kokoda but abandoned the initial attempt. It then disappeared shortly before its *second* scheduled landing. So, it only tried to land twice, not three times.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   **A:** The passage mentions weather as a factor in the failed initial landing attempt.
*   **B:** The crash site is described as remote and difficult to access.
*   **D:** Bad weather is described as hindering the search efforts.
"
Nini esalaki ete Vol CG4684 elongola kokita na yango?,"The correct answer is **A: Esika oyo bazalaki kokita ezalaki esika oyo bato bakoki kokota te** (The landing site was inaccessible).

The text states: ""Esika aksida esalemaki eyebani lelo mpe eza mpasi na kokoma kuna yango wana babwakaki bango na zamba mpona kokende na bisika wana mpe koluka bato oyo babiki."" This directly implies the initial planned landing site was inaccessible.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Ezalaki na mpepo misusu ebele liboso ya CG4684:** This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Bazongisaki nzela ya mpepɔ yango na Kokoda:** The text states it was initially supposed to land in Kokoda and then attempted again, so it's not being returned there; it's where it was supposed to be.
*   **D: Mopepe ezalaki mabe:** The text says bad weather *hindered* the search, not that it caused the aborted landing.

Therefore, the answer is A.
"
"Na kotalela bokomi, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi oyo elobeli likambo oyo Franciszek Kowal akutanaki na yango ezali solo?","The correct answer is **B: Nsukansuka, azwaki mpasi te**.

Here's why:

* **P (the given text)** states ""Eza esengo mpo eloko moko te ekomeli ngai,"" which translates to ""I am happy that nothing happened to me.""  This clearly indicates that he survived unharmed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Alongaki kobuka lininisa moko (He managed to break a window)** - The text says *bato* (people) broke a window, not specifically Franciszek.
* **C: Abukaki kiti moko ntango azalaki koluka kobima (He broke a chair while trying to escape)** - The text says *bato* (people) were hitting windows with chairs, not specifically Franciszek.
* **D: Azokaki ntango azalaki koluka kobuka lininisa (He got injured while trying to break a window)** - The text explicitly says nothing happened to him.
"
Mpo na nini ezali mpasi mpo na koyeba bopusi oyo mopepe makasi Danielle ekoki kobimisa?,"The correct answer is **C: Mopepe yango ezali mosika na kokóma na mabele** (The storm is far from making landfall).

The passage states: ""Lokola mopepe makasi ezalaki mosika ya kokoma na mabele, eza mpasi na koyeba mabe ekoki kosala na Etats-Unis to na Caraïbes.""  This directly translates to ""Because the storm was far from making landfall, it is difficult to know what damage it could cause to the United States or the Caribbean.""

Therefore, the reason it's hard to know the impact is the distance from land.
"
"Kolandana na bokomi, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi oyo elobeli Mopɛpɛ makasi Danielle ezali solo te?","The correct answer is **D: Ezali pene na kokita na mabele** (It is close to making landfall).

Here's why:

*   **A: Impact na yango na Caraïbes eyebani te** (Its impact on the Caribbean is not known): The text states it's difficult to know the potential impact on the U.S. or the Caribbean because the storm is far from land. This makes A a true statement based on the text.
*   **B: Esalemaki na Mbu Atlantike** (It formed in the Atlantic Ocean): The text says it formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, which is true.
*   **C: Ekokaki kobongwana mopepe makasi** (It could become a hurricane): The National Hurricane Center scientists predict it will strengthen into a hurricane by Wednesday.
*   **D: Ezali pene na kokita na mabele** (It is close to making landfall): The text explicitly states that it is difficult to know the storm's impact because it is far from land.

Therefore, only D is false according to the given text."
"Kolandana na bokomi, nini balobaka ete esengeli kosalema na bokono liboso ya kobimisa bokono ya mokili mobimba?","The correct answer is **A: Esengeli kokoma oyo ebomaka mingi te**.

The passage states: ""...bolukiluki mosusu emonisi ete maladi wana ekoboma lisusu bato mingi te liboso ekomona maladi ya mokili mobimba.""  This translates to: ""...some research shows that the disease will not kill many people before it becomes a global pandemic.""

Therefore, the disease needs to become less deadly before a global pandemic occurs.
"
"Kolandana na bokomi, mopepe makasi ezalaki mosika boni na Fujian?","The correct answer is **C: 70 kilomètres**.

The passage states ""liso ya l'œil Morakot ezalaki pene ya bakilometele tuku nsambo pene ya etuka ya Chine ebengami Fujian"" which translates to ""the eye of typhoon Morakot was about seventy kilometers near the Chinese province called Fujian.""
"
Nani apesaki George W. Bush mbote ntango akomaki na Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng mpe Lee Hsien Loong** (Wong Kan Seng and Lee Hsien Loong).

The passage states that Wong Kan Seng welcomed him upon arrival and later he talked with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
"
Ntango nini président alobelaki na ntina na kotanda nkita na Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Kolanda kobungisa maponami na ye ya katikati** (Following his midterm election losses).

The text states that ""nsima ya mposo moko ya kokweya na maponi ya katikati, Bush ayebisaki bato ete azobanda kosala mombongo na Asie."" This translates to ""after a week of losing the midterm elections, Bush announced that he was starting to do business in Asia.""
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na kati ya makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali mokano ya guvɛrnema mobimba?","Eyano ya malamu ezali **D: Kitisa ebele ya batu na mituka**.

Ndima ya ntina ya lisolo ezali ete boyangeli ezali koluka kobakisa mituka mpo na kokitisa ebele ya bato na mituka. Mikano mosusu (A, B, na C) ezali nde makambo oyo esalemi mpo na kokokisa ndima wana.
"
Guvernema esakolaki nini?,"P: The announcement today adds to a government commitment made in March of this year to fund additional vehicles. Adding 300 vehicles will mean we need to purchase 1,300 vehicles to alleviate overcrowding.

Q: What did the government announce?

The best answer is **A: Bazali kokana kopesa mosolo mpo na kobakisa ba chariots 300** (They are planning to provide money to add 300 vehicles).

While the passage also discusses a goal of 1,300 vehicles, the *announcement* specifically concerns the addition of 300.  The other options are either not the primary focus of the announcement or factually incorrect.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, makambo nini eyebani?","The best answer based on the passage is **A: Nivo ya likama ekitisami**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states ""kokitisa nivo ya likama na makasi"" which translates to ""reducing the level of danger significantly""**.  Therefore, we know the level of danger has been lowered.
* **B: Likama ezali lisusu te (The danger is no more)** is incorrect because the passage continues with ""kasi, kokitisa nivo ya likama na makasi elimboli te ete likama nyonso esili"" which translates to ""but, reducing the level of danger significantly does not mean that all danger is gone"".  This directly contradicts option B.
* **C: Bazali kozela ete babundisa bango (They are expecting to be attacked)** is not directly supported by the passage.  The passage only says there's no clear intelligence indicating imminent war, but it doesn't say anything about expecting or not expecting an attack.
* **D: Mayele ya libateli endimi ete kobunda yango ekozala makasi (The intelligence believes the fight will be difficult)** is incorrect because the passage states that there is no intelligence that indicates war will happen soon.

Therefore, the only statement that can be definitively confirmed from the passage is that the level of danger has been reduced.
"
Liloba nini na ntina na kotemela ezali ya solo te?,"Ngai nakanisi eyano ya malamu eza **B: Mampo nampo nami oyo elekaki nde ebimisaki botelemeli yango.**

"
Nani apesaki likanisi ete CEP ya suka atika mosala?,"The correct answer is **C: Commission présidentielle (Presidential Commission)**.

The text says ""Na sanza eleki etuluku moko elobaki ete liboso CEP alongwa mosala..."" which translates to ""Last month a group said that the last CEP should resign..."".  This ""group"" is referred to as ""etuluku moko"" which translates to ""a group"", and the text later identifies that group as ""Commission présidentielle""."
"Kolandana na liyebisi, nini esungami te na USA Gymnastics nsima na komonisa mpasi basani ya Nassar?","The correct answer is **D: Koluka bonsomi** (Seeking freedom).

Here's why:

*   **A: Kolongolama ya mokanda** (Removal of the certificate) - The passage specifically states that changes go beyond just removing certificates: ""kaka te kolongola ba certificat"".
*   **B: Kosala bisika ya kofanda kozala na nguya** (Making the facilities powerful) - While the passage emphasizes safety and a suitable environment, it doesn't directly mention making facilities ""powerful."" The focus is on creating a safe and ethical environment.
*   **C: Mbongwana oyo esengeli na kati ya ebongiseli** (Necessary change within the organization) - The passage explicitly states that necessary changes within the organization must be made.

The passage emphasizes creating a safe environment for athletes to achieve their dreams. It doesn't say that seeking freedom for the survivors of abuse is not supported; rather, it's not directly stated as a specific action the USA Gymnastics supports after the abuse. So, option D is the most supported answer."
"Kolandana na liyebisi, mokano monene ya Gimnastique ya USA mpe ya komite olympique ya Etats-Unis ezali nini mpo na kokende liboso?","The correct answer is **D: Kotombola esika ya libateli mpo na basani**.

The text explicitly states that both USA Gymnastics and the USOC are committed to ""kolendisa esika ya mosala ya libateli mpona bato na biso nyonso oyo bazosala lisano wana"" and to ""kolendisa masano ya gymnastique, mpe misusu, mpo ezala na libateli mpona bato bazosala yango."" This translates to promoting a safe environment for athletes. While acknowledging the past abuse is important (option A), the *forward-looking* goal is athlete safety. Options B and C are not directly supported by the text.
"
Masuwa ezalaki kokende wapi ntango likambo yango esalemaki? ,"The text says: ""Masuwa ya bitumba ebengami Avenger oyo elongolaka babombe, ezalaki kokende na Puerto Princesa na Palawan.""

So the correct answer is **C: Palawan**
"
Oyo ezali likambo ya solo te na oyo etali masuwa oyo balobeli na mokapo?,"Réponse correcte ezali:

**B: Ezali na Palawan**

Explication:

Le texte précise que le navire se *dirigeait* vers Puerto Princesa, à Palawan. Il n'est donc pas encore *sur* Palawan. Les autres affirmations (A, C, et D) sont directement confirmées par le texte.
"
Nani apesaki maloba maye matali basoda ya Etats-Unis?,"A: Donald Trump
"
"Kolandana na liyebisi, mboka nini ezwaki mokumba ya kokengela babundi oyo bakangami?","The correct answer is **D: Turquie**.

The passage states: ""Turquie ezalaki pe na mokumba ya kobatela basoda ya Etat islamique oyo bakangaki..."" which translates to ""Turkey also had the responsibility to guard the captured soldiers of the Islamic State..."".
"
Bato bakanisaka ete nini nde esalaki motuka yango ekwea?,"The passage states: ""Aksida esalemaki na likolo mpenza na likolo ya ngomba, mpe bakanisi ete mbala mosusu eutaki na moto ya makasi."" This translates to: ""The accident happened very high on a mountain, and they think it was possibly caused by **strong wind**.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Moto ya makasi (Strong wind)**. Although D (Mopepe ya mabe) translates to ""bad wind"", the passage specifically mentions ""moto ya makasi"" (strong wind) as the suspected cause.
"
Na lolenge nini ya mabele likámá yango esalemaki?,"The correct answer is **D: Ezali na bangomba**

The text states that the accident happened ""na likolo mpenza na likolo ya ngomba"" which means ""very high on a mountain"".
"
Bakonzi bazali kolikya nini mpo na mpela yango?,"Response: A
Explanation:
The passage states: ""Atako nivo ya mai ekomata kaka mwa moko soki mai ekomi mingi, bakonzi bazolikia ete ekokoka kobongisa bazelo oyo ebima kuta na liboso."" This translates to ""Even though the water level only rises slightly when it floods, authorities hope it will be able to restore the sandbars that have emerged previously."" Thus, the correct answer is A: Kozongisama ya ba barres ya sable (Restoration of sandbars)."
"Na kati ya makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi botongi ya barrage esimbaki mpo na libela?","According to the passage, the construction of the dam significantly affected the following:

*   ""Yango wana, lolenge mibale ya bambisi elimwa, mpe mibale mosusu ekomi na likama, ata mpe chevelu oyo ezalaki na kuki."" (Therefore, two species of fish disappeared, and two others are endangered...). This indicates a negative impact on fish populations.

*   ""eloko wana eza ntina mingi mpona kosala bisika zelo ekangama mpe mabongo, oyo ezalaki bisika ya kofanda na banyama."" (That is very important for the formation of sandbanks and beaches, which were animal habitats). This indicates that the dam impacted the formation of sandbanks, beaches, and consequently, the animal habitats.

Based on the options given, the most direct and permanent impact mentioned is on the **C: Bisika oyo banyama ya zamba bafandaka (The places where wild animals live/Animal Habitats).** While the sandbanks were affected, the *effect* was on the animal habitats. The impact on fish is clearly stated but the best answer from the options provided is the loss of animal habitat.

Therefore, the best answer is **C**.
"
"Kolandana na bokomi, nani apesaki na mayele ya laibateli yaEtats-Unis oyo etali bibundi oyo ekoki kozala?","Eyano ya malamu ezali C: Esika oyo eyebani te.

"
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola ndenge ya kobunda ya botelemi ya?","The correct answer is **C: Kopanza babombe na bisika ya ntina na mikili mibale** (Spreading bombs in important places in two countries).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the attacks will occur in both Kenya and Ethiopia (two countries).
*   It also mentions the attacks will be a ""major event"" (translated as ""likambo ya ntina mingi""), implying they are targeting important/significant places."
"Na kati ya bato oyo elandi, nani azali avocat te?","The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

*   **Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos:** The text states they are ""Baavoka ya Grese oyo bayebana mingi"" (Well-known Greek lawyers).
*   **Petros Mantouvalos:** The text mentions he is ""moto ya parlema mpe avoka"" (Member of Parliament and lawyer).
*   **Makis Triantafylopoulos:** The text describes him as a ""mopanzi-sango"" (journalist) who hosted a TV show.

Therefore, Makis Triantafylopoulos is the only one who is explicitly identified as a journalist and *not* a lawyer."
Etuluku nini ya bato balobelami te ete bazali na kati ya likambo ya nsɔni na kati ya lisangá ya mibeko ya Grèce?,"Eyano ya malamu ezali C: Bapanzi-sango.

"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali ntina ya kozanga bosepeli ya Adam Cuerden te?","The correct answer is **D: Lokuta na ntina ya bolongoli ya boyebi**.

Here's why:

The text says Cuerden amonisaki kanda na ye ndenge bazolongola bato. He then says Wales ""akosaki biso banda na ebandeli."" He specifically says Wales lied about the reason for the removals (""asalaki neti ete eza mpona makambo etali mibeko""). This translates to ""pretending it was for legal reasons,"" meaning the lie was about the *reason* for the takedowns (the removal of content). The other options are related to the situation, but Cuerden's direct anger stems from being lied to about why content was being removed.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini elongolamaki na site?","The correct answer is **B: Makambo ya kosangisa nzoto**.

The text states that the anger of people resulted in new efforts to create a policy regarding ""makambo ya kosangisa nzoto"" (sexual content) for a site with videos and photos. Therefore, the material being removed/addressed is sexual content.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi Amir Khan azali kosunga te?","The correct answer is **C: Makanisi ya basi (Women's views/The idea of women boxing)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage clearly states Amir Khan's personal belief: ""Na motema na ngai nakanisi basi basengeli kobunda te"" (""In my heart, I think women should not box""). This directly contradicts support for women boxing.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **Bawelani ya Angleterre (British Athletes)**: The passage indicates he will support the British athletes at the 2012 Olympics.
*   **D: Londres oyo ezali koyamba masano ya Olympique (London hosting the Olympic Games)**: While he may or may not personally agree with London hosting, the passage implies his support by stating he will support the British athletes there.
*   **Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi Amir Khan azali kosunga te** (Considering the writings above, what is Amir Khan not supporting?): The sentence itself is incomplete and makes no sense."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, kati na oyo elandi Amir Khan akozala kosunga ata soki azali na makanisi na ye moko?","The correct answer is **C: Masano olympiques 2012**.

The passage states Amir Khan will support the Great Britain athletes at the 2012 Olympics. Therefore, he is supporting the Olympics themselves.
"
Peter Lenz akufaki ntango nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Na lopitalo** (In the hospital).

The passage states that Lenz was taken to a local hospital where he later died.
"
Xavier Zayat azali nani?,"The correct answer is **B: Mopoti mbangu mosusu**.

The text states that Xavier Zayat ""atutaki ye"" (hit him) after Lenz fell off his bike during a race. This clearly indicates that Zayat was another racer.
"
Na ezalela nini moto oyo azali kotungisa mpɛpɔ akoki kozwa matomba soki ayebaki ndenge oyo mpɛpɔ esalaka na kati?,"The best answer is **B: Soki koyina na bango kopumbwa ezali na katikati ya bobangi ya makambo oyo eyebani te**.

Here's why:

* **P: The prompt explicitly states:** ""...koyeba mwa makambo ndenge mpepo esalaka pe makambo elekaka ntango etambolaka ekoki kosalisa na kolonga bobangi ya eloko oyebi te to ndenge ozokamba te."" (Knowing a little bit about how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help overcome the fear of the unknown or unfamiliar).

* **B: directly addresses this:** If their fear of flying is rooted in a fear of the *unknown*, then understanding how planes work will directly combat that fear.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Soki mokumbi motuka ayoki soni mpo na bobangi na bango:** While the prompt mentions not being ashamed of the fear, the benefit of knowing how planes work isn't about shame, but about reducing the *fear* itself.

* **C: Soki mokumbi motuka azali mabe na mitindo nyonso ya kokumba:** This is too broad. Someone bad at all forms of transportation might still be afraid of flying for reasons unrelated to not understanding how it works.

* **D: Soki mitungisi na bango euti na makambo ya mpasi oyo ezali na boyokani te na kopumbwa:** If the anxiety comes from traumatic experiences *unrelated* to flying, then knowing how a plane works won't address the root of their fear.

Therefore, **B** is the most logical answer, directly aligning with the prompt's explanation of how knowledge can alleviate fear of flying when that fear stems from the unknown.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi oyo azali kosala mobembo asengeli kosala mpo na koumela?","Answer: C, D 

Explanation:
The original text says:
*   Do not book directly without searching and comparing prices.
*   The same flight can have different prices depending on the seller.
*   It's good to compare search results
*   and also check the airline's website before booking.

This clearly points to comparing prices across travel companies (C) and checking the airline's website (D).
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini bato oyo basalaka mibembo basengeli kosala liboso mpo na kozwa ntalo ya mpɛpɔ oyo eleki malamu?","Based on the passage, the best answer is **B: Tala talo na bitondisi mingi** (Look at prices on multiple sites).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly advises against booking directly with the airline without comparing prices, and suggests using search engines to find the best deal.
*   While A (Tala site Internet ya kompanyi ya mpepo) (Check the airline's website) is mentioned, it's as a *final* step *after* comparing results.
*   C and D both suggest booking directly, which the passage advises against *before* comparison.

Therefore, **B** best reflects the overall recommendation in the passage.
"
Ntango nini moninga asengeli kokende elongo mpo na kotika biloko?,"The correct answer is **A: Ntango biloko etindami na nzela ya fret aérien** (When the goods are sent by air freight).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lolenge moko pamba ya kokende noki ezalaki ya kotinda yango lokola bifunda basi batala. Mibeko ya mibembo ya mpepo ekopesa nzela te kotinda bifunda kozanga kolo na yango, wana esika baza na mposa na yo.""  This directly translates to ""The only way to go quickly was to send it as accompanied baggage.  Airline travel regulations do not allow unaccompanied baggage, that's where they need you.""

* **This means** the text suggests accompanying the shipment *only* when sending it as checked baggage.  This is a workaround to a problem arising when sending by air freight and needing it urgently.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ntango entreprise esalelaka mpepo na ye moko** (When the company uses its own plane): The passage says larger companies *already* have their own planes, thus the problem being discussed doesn't exist for them.
* **C: Ntango biloko ezali kotindama lokola mokumba oyo endimami** (When the goods are being sent as accepted cargo): The entire problem the passage highlights is the *delay* in getting items through customs and offloaded when sent as regular cargo (fret aérien).
* **D: Ntango mokumba esimbami na kopanyi ya monene** (When the cargo is handled by a large company):  The passage explicitly states that the problem mostly exists for smaller companies (""mpona banzela misusu mpe bakompani na ya mike"").

Therefore, the most accurate answer, based on the passage, is **A**.
"
"Na kotalela eteni yango, ntango ozali kopona kompanyi ya mpepo ya Frequent Flyer na boyokani, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi osengeli kotya na esika ya liboso?","The correct answer is **A: Kopanyi ya mpepo oyo epesaka pwe mingi (A: The airline that offers more points)**.

The passage explicitly states that ""mbala mingi mabaku malamu oyo bapesaka ekeseni pe mbala mingi bapesaka bapoint mingi na bakompani mosusu ya nzela wana (often the best opportunities differ and often more points are offered by other companies on that route)."" This directly supports prioritizing airlines that offer more points in their frequent flyer program.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nani akoki kopesa pwe ya kopanyi mbala mingi koleka?","The prompt says ""mbala mingi bapesaka bapoint mingi na bakompani mosusu ya nzela wana,"" meaning other airlines on the same route often give more points.  Option A, ""Kopanyi yam pepo mosusu na bosangani mosusu"" (Another airline in another alliance) directly reflects this.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, eteni nini ya nzoto kati na oyo elandi ekoki kobeba mpo na komɛla masanga mingi?","The correct answer is **B: Komona (Seeing)**.

The text states that excessive alcohol consumption can lead to liver disease, blindness, and even death. The passage also mentions that illegally produced alcohol can contain dangerous substances like methanol, which can cause blindness. Therefore, seeing is the part of the body from the options that can be harmed due to excessive alcohol consumption.
"
"Lokola elobami na mokapo yango, nini ekoki kokitisa bopusi mabe ya masanga?","The correct answer is **C: Komela masanga na bokatikati** (Drinking alcohol in moderation).

The passage explicitly states ""Bomela masanga na bokatikati"" which translates to ""Drink alcohol in moderation."" The rest of the passage warns about the dangers of excessive or unregulated alcohol consumption.
"
Wapi mwa ndambo ya motuya ya biloko oyo eleki likoló na Amsterdam?,"The most accurate answer is **A: District ya Canal**.

The passage directly states that the Canal District (Grachtengordel) is a well-known 17th-century area surrounding the Binnenstad of Amsterdam. This makes it the most direct and relevant answer to the question about the most expensive piece of property in Amsterdam. While the other options are related to the passage and/or Amsterdam, they are not the *most* expensive piece of property.

*   **B:** UNESCO designation adds value, but doesn't inherently make it the most expensive.
*   **C:** Lands removed from Binnenstad is too vague.
*   **D:** Places with historical value is too broad; not all historical sites are the most expensive real estate.
"
Mpo na nini Etuka ya Canal eponamaki lokola Libula ya Mokili mobimba na UNESCO?,"The correct answer is **A: Ezali motuya na ntina ya makambo eleki mpe na ntina ya bokoko**.

The paragraph states that the Canal Ring was chosen as a UNESCO World Heritage Site *mpona bokoko na yango pe ntina na yango na masolo ya kala* (for its culture and historical significance). Option A directly reflects this reason.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi esalaka ete kokende na Phnom Krom ezala na ntina?","The correct answer is **D: Mobembo ya masuwa na laki**.

The text says: ""Vizite ya esika wana bakoki mpenza kosangisa yango na mwa mobembo ya masuwa mpona kotala etima."" (You can combine the visit with a boat trip on the lake). This implies that the boat trip is a desirable and potentially integral part of the experience.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: Talatala na likolo ya Tonle Sap** While the view of Tonle Sap adds to the climb, the text primarily highlights the combination of the temple visit with the boat trip. The view is a nice bonus, but not the main reason to go.
*   **B: Kosala mobembo na nzela ya Angkor Pass** The text mentions Angkor Pass, but only as something needed to access the temple, not as a reason *to go* to Phnom Krom. It's a practical requirement, not a benefit.
*   **C: Komona Siem Reap** The temple is near Siem Reap, but the primary draw is the temple and lake experience itself, not just seeing the town."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini esengeli mpo ete bapaya bákota na Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Kozwa makoki ya koleka ya Angkor** (Getting an Angkor pass).

The text explicitly states: ""Esika ya koleka na Angkor eza ntina mingi mpona kokota na tempelo, yango wana kobosana te komema passeport na yo ntango ozokende na Tonlé Sap."" (An Angkor pass is very important to enter the temple, that is why don't forget to bring your passport when you go to Tonlé Sap.)
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kopekisa mopaya akende kotala Antarctique?","Po na kotalela makambo oyo epesami na P, toyebi ete:

**Réponse:** A
"
Mopaya oyo alingaka komata bangomba akoki kokende na eteni nini ya Antarctique?,"The text says ""...bampepo mosusu oyo ekendaka ntango mosusu na bisika ya mabele, mpona komata bangomba to kokoma na songe, oyo eza na esika ya monene."" This translates to ""...some expeditions sometimes go to the mainland, to climb mountains or reach the summit, which is in the Inland area."" Therefore, the answer is B.
"
Esika ya kotala y akoya liboso na makambo ya sika ezali wapi?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

**C: Na esika oyo ezali mosika**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Batelescope ebele ya bolukiluki ya lelo eza bisika ya minene oyo eza na bisika ya mosika oyo ezalaka na mopepe ya malamu."" (Many of today's research telescopes are large installations in remote locations with good atmospheric conditions.) This directly supports the idea that modern observatories are located in remote places.

Let me know if you'd like me to explain why the other options are incorrect!
"
Ekoki kozala ete télescope ya bolukiluki ya mikolo na biso ekozala wapi?,"The correct answer is **D: Na esika moko monene**

The passage states that modern research telescopes are located in remote, high-altitude locations with good atmospheric conditions, which are described as ""bisika ya minene oyo eza na bisika ya mosika oyo ezalaka na mopepe ya malamu"". This translates to ""large places that are in remote locations with good air"".
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, esika nini ekozala malamu mpo na mokolo ya kimya na libongo?","The best answer is **C: The North Harbor District**. Here's why:

*   The text mentions that the beaches in the North Harbor district are ""mabongo ya zelo oyo eza na bisika malamu ya kobeta mai"" (sandy beaches with good swimming spots) and often shaded by pohutukawa trees. This suggests a calm and pleasant experience.
*   While Mission Bay and St Heliers (A and B) are described as beautiful, the text also notes that they ""ntango mosusu etondaka"" (are sometimes crowded). The question asks for a location for a calm day at the beach.
*   Waitemata Harbor (D) is just the body of water where beaches are located, not a specific beach area.

Therefore, the North Harbor district, with its sandy beaches and shade, is the most likely to offer a calm and relaxing beach day."
"Nakotala makomi oyo elekiKolandana na bokomi, esika nini emonani kozala na libateli malamu mpo na kobeta mai ?","Based on the text, the safest place to swim seems to be **C: Central Auckland**.

Here's why:

*   The text mentions ""Kosokola na mai ezalaka na likama te"" which translates to ""Swimming in the water is not dangerous"" referring to the beaches on Tamaki Drive in Central Auckland.
*   While the northern beaches are described as good for swimming, there's no specific mention of them being particularly safe or unsafe compared to Central Auckland.
*   Devonport and Long Bay are mentioned as locations defining the boundaries of the North Harbour beaches, but not explicitly described as safe swimming locations."
"Ntango ozali kotala esika oyo mokapo yango elobeli, oyo wapi na makambo oyo elandi ekotalelama lokola oyo ebongi te?","The correct answers are **B: Kotika elembo esika moko boye zingazinga ya esika yango**, **C: Kosala maseki**, and **D: Kokatakata eloko moko oyo etongami**.

The passage explicitly prohibits making jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis (C) and defacing the site by writing or scratching on it (which includes B and D).  A: Kosala makambo ya lokumu (Acting honorably) is explicitly encouraged.
"
"Na kati na yango, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola minoko oyo esanganisi minoko mingi?","The correct answer is **C: Etongamaki**

Here's why:

* **P defines ""balokota ya mike"" as languages that are *constructed* (etongamaki) with the intention of facilitating communication.**

The other options don't fit as well:

* **A: Ebongisami (Organized/Arranged)** While constructed languages are organized, the core idea is that they are *built* or *created*.
* **B: Ya kosangisa (Mixed)** While some constructed languages might borrow elements from existing languages, ""mixed"" doesn't fully capture the intentional creation aspect.
* **D: Organique (Organic)** This refers to natural languages that evolved over time, which is the opposite of a constructed language.
"
Liloba nini elimboli na bosikisiki te minoko ya lisalisi?,"The best answer is **C: Ezali minoko oyo etongami mpo na kobongisa ba Makambo ya kosolola**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** defines constructed languages (balokota ya mike) as intentionally created to improve communication.  Answer C directly reflects this by saying ""It is languages that are built to improve communication issues.""

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ezali minoko biologiquess oyo esalelamaka mpo na kosalisa kosolola kati ya batu oyo bakoki kososola na bango te:** Constructed languages are not biological. The main idea is that it helps people communicate who could not understand each other without it
* **B: Ezali minoko oyo ezali na ndenge ya bomoto mpe oyo etongami:** While constructed languages *are* constructed, stating they have ""human nature"" is not the right idea here. The focus is on the constructed part.
* **D: Ezali minoko oyo esalemi oyo ezali na bokonzi kati na balobi ya minoko ndenge na ndenge:** Constructed languages don't necessarily have authority/dominance over speakers of different languages. The goal is to simply facilitate communication. It is not a dominating force

**Therefore, C is the most accurate and directly reflects the information provided in the passage.**

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, mokumbi motuka asengeli kotala nini soki mobembo na bango ya masuwa ezali na eleko ya malili?","The correct answer is **A: Esika ya kabine**.

The passage specifically warns about the noise of ice formation around cabins during winter in the Baltic Sea. While the passage mentions other aspects (visa requirements, time in St. Petersburg), the only one directly related to advice for winter cruises is the location of the cabin.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, soki mobembo ya mobembo ya mokumbi motuka ezali na eleko ya molunge, nini bakoki kozala na likoki ya kokima?","The passage focuses on the difficulties and conditions specific to winter travel in the Baltic Sea. The question asks what someone could *avoid* if traveling in the summer.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Ntango na engumba (Time in the city):** This is unrelated to the season. You'll still have to spend time in the city regardless of when you travel.
*   **B: Koleka na kati ya glace (Passing through ice):** The passage states that strong winter freeze ups cause issues. By travelling in the summer, you would **avoid passing through ice**.
*   **C: Bosengeli ya visa (Visa requirement):** The passage specifically mentions no visa requirements, regardless of the season, so this is incorrect.
*   **D: Saint Petersburg:** Saint Petersburg is the destination, not something to avoid.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Koleka na kati ya glace (Passing through ice)**."
Mpo na nini basalelaka mingi monoko ya Catalan mpo na bilembo mpe mayebisi na Barcelone?,"The correct answer is **B: Ezalaki monoko ya liboso officiel na engumba**

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Kasi, bilembo mingi ezolakisa kaka na Catalan po endimami na mibeko lokola lokota ya leta."" This indicates that Catalan's official status is the reason for its prevalence on signs. Option B captures this legal and historical significance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bato basosoli yango mingi koleka Espagnol:** The text states that nearly everyone knows Spanish (""pene ya bato nyonso bayebi Espagnole""), and that fewer people speak Catalan as their preference (""pene ya katikati ya bato basepelaka koloba Catalan"").
*   **C: Ezali monoko oyo bato balingaka mingi na Barcelone:** While some people prefer Catalan, the passage doesn't explicitly say it's the most *liked* language overall, but rather that it is the official language.
*   **D: Métro mpe bisika mosusu ya bato nyonso ekendaka mingimingi na bana-mboka oyo balobaka monɔkɔ ya Catalan:** The text makes no claim regarding who uses public transport the most."
"Na minoko oyo elandi, oyo wapi esalelamaka na Système ya Metro ya Barcelone mpo na kopesa mayebisi mbala na mbala?","The correct answer is **B: Catalan**.

The text clearly states that regular announcements in the Barcelona Metro are made only in Catalan.
"
"Na kotalela mokapo, nini kati na biloko oyo elandi ekoki kozala te na esika ya liboso na mbeto mpe bilei ya ntɔ́ngɔ́ ya likoló?","The passage focuses on the importance of high-quality bed linens, locally sourced or preferred breakfast items, and a beautiful, potentially historic, setting with gardens and a pool. It doesn't mention anything about modern amenities like fast WiFi. Therefore, the answer is most likely:

**D: WiFi ya mbangu** (Fast WiFi)

Let's break down why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Biloko ya kolia ya bomoko mpenza** (Unique breakfast items) - The passage explicitly states that breakfast should consist of local delicacies or dishes the guest enjoys. This implies unique and special offerings.

*   **B: Biloko ya ndako ya kala oyo ekokani na mosusu te** (Unique antique furniture) - The passage mentions a beautiful old house with antiques, suggesting unique and irreplaceable furniture.

*   **C: Bisika ya libanda oyo ebatelami malamu** (Well-maintained outdoor areas) - The passage mentions gardens and a pool, which need to be well-maintained to contribute to the overall luxurious experience."
"Na kotalela eteni oyo, na kati ya makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali te moko ya makambo minene ya momekano kati na ba B&B ya kitoko?","The correct answer is **A: Kongalisa ya mikolo oyo (Modern conditioning)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on:**
    *   High-quality bedding (especially custom or antique)
    *   Delicious and regionally specific breakfast options.
    *   A beautiful, perhaps historic setting with amenities like a garden or pool.

*   **The passage does not directly discuss or emphasize modern conditioning (e.g., air conditioning).** While it may be a desirable amenity, the core of a great B&B experience, according to the passage, lies in the quality of the bed, breakfast, and overall ambiance.

Therefore, modern conditioning is not identified as a key competitive element within the text."

*   **D: Milulu ya bosukisi (Closing ceremonies)**
*   **B: Makambo ya glace oyo ezali kosalema na kati ya ndako (Indoor ice sports)**

So the best answer is **B, C, and D**. But since you have to choose only one, the most encompassing answer is **C: Masano olympique ya eleko ya malili (Winter Olympics)**, as the other events are part of the Winter Olympics.

"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na lolenge nini ya motuka bakoki kozwa ba passeport mpo na kokata mokumbi maloba te?","The correct answer is **B: Engbunduka ya butu (Night train)**.

The passage specifically states ""Na bingbunduka oyo ezalaka bambeto na butu, mokumbi akoki kozwa ba passeport mpo bakata yo te pongi na yo"" which translates to ""On night trains with beds, the conductor may take passports so that your sleep is not interrupted.""
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango nini bakoki kotala carte na yo kati na Engbunduka mosusu oyo ekatisaka ndelo?","The correct answer is **D: Na engbunduka oyo ezali kopota mbangu** (On a train that is moving/traveling).

The text states: ""Na bingbunduka mosusu oyo ekendaka na bamboka mingi, batalaka mikanda na biloko na nzela ntango engbunduka ezotambola..."" which translates to ""On some trains that go to multiple countries, they check documents and belongings while the train is moving...""

Here's why:

*   **P states that Singapore is located very close to the equator and you have to contend with heat.**

The other options are less directly related to the passage:

*   **A: Ntango nini bakoki koyiba (When can they steal)** - While theft can happen anywhere, the passage doesn't suggest Singapore is particularly prone to it.
*   **B: Kozanga kokoma na butike (Not being able to shop)** - The passage says the opposite - you can buy anything after arriving.
*   **D: kobunga nzela (Getting lost)** - The passage mentions Singapore is safe and easy to travel around, making it less likely to get lost.
"
Nani akoki kolinga koboya kolya mampa ya Allemagne?,"The correct answer is **A: Moto oyo azali na allergie makasi na noix**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that German bread often contains almonds, poppy seeds, and other nuts. Someone with a severe nut allergy would need to avoid these items.

The other options are less likely:

*   **B:** The passage describes the bread as often being eaten with coffee, suggesting that it's not overly sweet or rich.
*   **C:** The passage doesn't specifically mention chocolate.
*   **D:** The passage doesn't suggest that German breads are predominantly sweet.
"
Biloko ya kolamba na yango nini etalelami lokola eloko ya kobakisa elengi na mapaAllemand?,"The correct answer is **D: Amandes** (Almonds).

The passage states: ""Biloko mingi ya Allemagne oyo basalaka neti mapa ezalaka mpe na **badame**, bandika ya moyindo, mpe banguba misusu ya nzete."" This translates to: ""Many German baked goods also have **almonds**, poppy seeds, and other nuts.""
"
"Kolandana na bokomi, oyo wapi kati na makambo oyo elandi ekozala te toli oyo esɛngami mpo na kosala mobembo na budget?","The correct answer is **C: Senga bato mbongo**.

The passage explicitly states that travelers should *not* beg. All the other options are in line with the idea of traveling on a tight budget.  Finding flexible accommodation (B) and lowering expenses (D) are ways to reduce costs, and working while traveling (A) is mentioned as an alternative way to fund your trip.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nani akoki kozala na mokakatano mpo na kosala mobembo na budget moke mpenza?","The passage focuses on minimizing expenses drastically while traveling. It even highlights that people who travel this way avoid theft, illegal activities, begging, and exploiting others.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Moto oyo ayambaka mokakatano moko (Someone who accepts a challenge)** - While minimizing expenses can be a challenge, this doesn't necessarily exclude someone from doing it. It depends on the type of challenge the person accept

*   **B: Moto oyo azali na mikakatano makasi ya ntango (Someone who has severe time constraints)** - The passage doesn't directly address time constraints. While extreme frugality might require more time for planning and finding deals, it's not a primary obstacle mentioned.

*   **C: Moto oyo azali kokana kosala na mosika ntango azali kosala mobembo (Someone who plans to work remotely while traveling)** - The first option of the passage is that someone can work while they travel. Working remotely can contradict the concept of drastically minimizing expenses. Therefore, the person can't really do the second option (minimizing expenses). This person is not included in the second idea/option of the passage.

*   **D: Moto oyo asepelaka kolanda programme ya mobembo (Someone who likes to follow a travel program)** - Following a fixed travel program might be difficult when trying to minimize expenses drastically. Budget travel might involve being flexible and adapting to cheaper opportunities as they arise. However, that doesn't mean someone that likes to follow program can't do the second option.

Given that the passage focuses on extremely low-budget travel that avoids any sort of illegal, unethical, or working behavior, **C** is the most likely answer. Someone who plans to work remotely while traveling is less likely to be interested in the very frugal methods discussed. The passage mentions the 2 options, if someone has the option to work while they are traveling, the need to be extremely frugal is no longer needed.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**.
"
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola malamu te motuka oyo ezali koleka kati na Point Marion mpe Fairmont?","The correct answer is **C: Batosaka ndelo ya mbangu mingi te**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that speed limits are lower than usual and that obeying them is crucial. This contradicts the idea that speed limits are not observed.
*   The passage states that cell phone service is unreliable in some areas along the drive, meaning D is incorrect.
*   A is correct as the passage describes the drive as rural
*   B is correct as the passage describes the drive as winding and narrow

Therefore, the only option that is not a description of driving between Point Marion and Fairmont is C."

"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi esengeli te mpo na kobanda kotambola kti na bangomba?","Based on the information provided, here's the breakdown:

*   **Question P** describes canoeing.
*   **Question Q** asks which skill is **not** needed for **mountain climbing**.

Canoeing involves paddling, climbing in/out of the canoe, and sometimes jumping (perhaps into the water). It's also described as not requiring as much intense exercise as mountain climbing.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Likoki ya kobeta mai (Likoki ya kobeta mai)** is not specifically needed to start mountain climbing. You need knowledge of terrain, potentially the ability to jump over some obstacles, and some basic training, but paddling/swimming skills are not a prerequisite for mountain climbing."
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kozala na ntina mpo na mobembo ya malamu na mabanga?","Based on the description of canoeing (P), the most relevant skill for a successful canoe trip would be:

*   **D: Makoki ya kobeta mai (Swimming skills)**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions that canoeing involves paddling (""makambo ya kobeta mai""). It also mentions the possibility of the canoe going underwater (""kosala canoe eza kokende na se ya canoe""). Therefore, swimming skills are essential for safety.
*   The other options are not directly relevant to canoeing. Although ""oyo eyebanaki liboso na kozinda na mai"" (prior knowledge of drowning) relates to safety, it's not a skill. ""Mokanda ya kosilisa kelasi ya kotambola kati na ngomba"" (mountaineering certificate) is for mountaineering, and ""Makoki ya masno oyo ekeyi liboso mpenza"" (Extensive boat experience) is not mentioned as specifically necessary in the text.

Therefore, the answer is **D**."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekozala na litomba mpo na moto oyo azali kokana kosala kaa na motuka na ye?","The best answer is **B: Motuka oyo epesaka nzela na bakiti ete elala** (A car that allows the seats to lie down).

Here's why:

*   **P** emphasizes that car camping is best with a van, SUV, sedan, or seats that recline. This makes **B** the most relevant and helpful piece of information for someone planning to car camp.
*   **A** (Bososoli makasi ya oyo mutuka nay o ekoki kosala te) refers to the need to understand your car's limitations which is useful but not the top choice
*   **C** (Hema) mentions a tent, which would not work while car camping
*   **D** (Oyo ya motu ye moko wapi kosalala kaa) refers to using your own space to camp, which is not useful if you are going on a trip

Therefore, **B** is the most practical piece of advice extracted from the passage for someone planning to car camp."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini batu oyo bazali nak aa na mituka bakoki kolinga kokima soki bazali koluka kotikala na nse ya radar?","The correct answer is **C: Kobongisa hema na engumba to na esika ya moto ye moko.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Kotia tenta na lopango na yo moko to na mboka moko na monene nyonso ekoki kobenda likebi kozanga ntina."" (Setting up a tent in your own yard or in a densely populated town can attract unwanted attention). The core message is that if one wants to avoid being noticed, they should refrain from setting up tents in populated areas.

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kotambwisa motuka ya monene, lokola SUV to minivan:** The text mentions having a bigger vehicle like a SUV or minivan would be helpful for car camping, but it doesn't indicate that it's something to avoid for the sake of staying under the radar.
*   **B: Kosala mobembo molai koleka na nzela:** Long journeys are mentioned in the beginning as something beautiful for easy movement, but not to avoid.
*   **D: Kozanga koyebana na motuka oyo bazali kosalela:** The text indicates that familiarizing yourself with the car you are using is a bonus.

Therefore, the answer is **C**."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nani atongaki lisusu Casablanca mbala ya mibale?","The correct answer is **D: Mokonzi ya Maroc**.

The passage states: ""Sultan ya Maroc etongaki lisusu engumba wana na nkombo ya Daru l-Badya..."" which translates to ""The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city with the name Daru l-Badya..."".
"
Nani atikalaki na engumba Casablanca ya mikolo na biso nsima ya likama oyo esalemaki na biloko oyo ezalisama?,"The correct answer is **C: Espagnol**.

The text states that after the Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city, Spanish merchants (Espagnols) who had trading posts in the area gave it the name Casablanca.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ndenge nini Sintra ayebanaki na bapaya?","The correct answer is **C: Botali malamu ya Lord Byron**.

The passage states that visitors made Sintra famous ""nsima wana Lord Byron abetaki lisolo ya malamu ya kitoko na yango"" which translates to ""after Lord Byron told a good story about its beauty"". This means his writing is what made it popular with visitors.
"
Nini endimami na Arménie te?,"The correct answer is **D: République ya sika**.

The text explicitly states that ""eza te ekolo eyebana - ata kutu Armenie - endimaka yango te"" referring to the new republic formed in Nagorno-Karabakh. The new republic is not recognized by Armenia.

"Ntango ozali kozwa taksi na Charlotte, nini ekoki komema na kofuta mbongo mosusu?","The correct answer is **B: Kozala na ba voyageurs misato**.

The passage states: ""Kilo eleki mingi mpo balekisaki bato 2, yango wana liponi wana ekoki kosenga mosolo mingi koleka oyo osengeli kofuta."" This translates to ""It's too heavy because they exceeded 2 people, therefore that option may require more money than you should pay."" This means having more than 2 people (so, three or more) in a taxi could result in extra charges.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekoki kotalelama lokola likambo ya mabe ya kofanda na Charlotte elongo na bana?","Esengeli kozala **B: Kozwa taxi**.

"Liboso ete bato ya Espagne báya, nani azalaki kotambwisa eteni ya nɔrdi ya Chili?","The correct answer is **D: BaInca**.

The passage states, ""Liboso Espagne ekoma na ekeke ya 16, nordi ya Chili ezalaki na nse ya boyangeli ya baInca..."" which translates to ""Before Spain arrived in the 16th century, the north of Chile was under the control of the Inca...""

This means people can reach the villages by train or boat, but not by car (except from the outside)

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Na engbunduka to na masuwa.
"
Liloba ya Italien ‘Cinque Terre’ ezali kolobela nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Bamboka mitano**.

The passage states: ""Cinque Terre, oyo elimbolia Mabele Mitano..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre, which means Five Lands..."" and the lands are the five villages.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, lolenge nini ya botte ebongi mpo na makambo oyo ekoki kogumbama na eleko ya malili?","The correct answer is **A: Sapato na talons mike**.

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes the importance of adequate tread depth (5 mm or 1/5 inch) and materials suited for icy conditions. High heels are not mentioned or advised.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A."
"Na kati ya biloko yango, oyo wapi ekosalisa te mpo na kobongisa traction na banzela oyo ezali na glace na ntango ya malili?","The correct answer is **D: Mayi (Water)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions zelo (sand), mabanga ya mike/gravier (small stones/gravel), and mungwa/chlorure ya calcium (salt/calcium chloride) as things spread on roads to improve traction.
*   Mayi/Water, when frozen, becomes glace, which *reduces* traction. Spreading water would only make the situation worse by creating more ice."
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekokani mpenza na Hawaii mpe Bisanga Cook?","Esengeli topona eyano oyo ekokani mpenza na Hawaii mpe Bisanga Cook engebene na lisolo.

"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola bisanga ya Cook malamu te?","The correct answer is **C: Bingumba minene ezali Rarotonga mpe Aitutaki**.

The passage states ""Bisanga Cook eza te na engumba ata moko kasi eza na bisanga 15 ekeseni. Bisanga ya minene eza Rarotonga na Aitutaki."" This clearly indicates that Rarotonga and Aitutaki are *islands*, not *cities*. The passage says the Cook Islands have no cities.

The other options are true based on the text:

*   **A: Ezali moke koleka Hawaii (It is smaller than Hawaii):** While the passage doesn't directly compare size, it implies this by mentioning that the islands remind visitors of old Hawaii before development.
*   **B: Ezali bisanga (It is islands):** The passage clearly states the Cook Islands are made up of 15 islands.
*   **D: Mboka ya esanga yango ezali na fuseau horaire moko na Hawaii (The island nation is in the same time zone as Hawaii):** The passage explicitly says this.
"
"Na kati ya bisika ya babateli zamba oyo elandi, oyo ya wapi epesaka lolenge mibale ya kopona mpo nae sika ya kolala?","The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

Here's why:

*   The text states ""Sirena eza esika moko pamba oyo babatela zamba oyo ezalaka na bachambre mingi ya kolala pe bilei ya moto pene ya ba camping."" This means Sirena offers both chambres ya kolala (dorm-style rooms) *and* camping options.
*   The text states ""La Leona, San Pedrillo na Los Patos ezalaka na camping kasi ezalaka te na malewa."" This indicates that La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos *only* offer camping.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, wapi okoki kobomba mokanda ya ndingisa ya parke soki olingi kosalela mbongo na esika ya kodefisa mbongo?","The correct answer is **C: CafeNet El Sol**.

The text says that ""CafeNet El Sol ezopesa misala ya kobombela bato bisika na 30$, to na 10$ mpona kolekisa mokolo moko; makambo mingi eza la lokasa ya Corcovado."" This indicates that CafeNet El Sol handles reservations and likely permits for the park. The prompt said ""nakotala makomi oyo eleki, wapi okoki kobomba mokanda ya ndingisa ya parke soki olingi kosalela mbongo na esika ya kodefisa mbongo?"". This suggests that you do not want to use a credit card. The only option that provides reservations and likely accepts cash is CafeNet El Sol.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sirena:** Sirena is a ranger station, but the text doesn't say you can book permits there with cash, only that you need a permit to stay there.
*   **B: Puerto Jiménez:** You can get park permits at the Ranger station in Puerto Jiménez, but they do not accept credit cards, which does not allow for usage of cash.
*   **D: La Leona:** La Leona is a camping site and doesn't handle park permits."

Batu ya kosala mobembo oyo bazuaki choc ya kokota lisusu bazali na ntango Makasi kosala nini?,"The correct answer is **D: Kozongela komesana na mimeseno na bango ya ndako.**

The passage explicitly states that travelers returning home after living abroad may find it difficult to readjust to their original culture: ""ntango mosusu ezalaka mpasi mingi bazongela lisusu mimeseno na bango ya kala"" (sometimes it is very difficult to return to their old customs).

Therefore, the biggest challenge for travelers experiencing re-entry shock is **re-adapting to their home culture.**

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, batu ya etuluku nini bazuaki makambo mingi koleka nsima ya kokoma ya batu ya kosala bolukiluki?","The correct answer is **C: Tainos**.

The text explicitly states that the Spanish colonizers greatly reduced the Tainos population, even killing around 100,000 between 1492 and 1498 according to Fray Bartolomé de las Casas.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, monoko nini bato ya Caraïbes bazalaki koloba?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

"
Nani bakoki koloba ete akómisaki bato mingi kosala ski lokola mosala ya kominanola?,"The passage doesn't explicitly state who popularized skiing as a recreational activity. However, it mentions Norwegians as being the people to create the first ski club, which could indicate some level of popularization of the sport.

Therefore, the best answer is **B: Norvégiens**.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, pene na ngonga nini lisano ya ski eyebanaki mpo na mbala ya liboso lokola lisano?","The correct answer is **D: 17ème siècle**.

The text states ""Lisano ebengami ski alpin ebanda soki pene ya ekeke 17..."" which translates to ""The sport called alpine skiing began around the 17th century...""
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi esanganaka mingimingi na esanga oyo eleki monene oyo ezali pembenipembeni ya libongo ya est ya afrique?","The best answer is **C: Banyama ya zamba**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Madagascar eza monene koleka, mpe eza kontina na ndenge na yango moko na oyo etali bazamba."" This directly connects Madagascar (the largest island) with its unique and significant wildlife. While the other options *might* apply to Madagascar to some extent, the passage emphasizes its distinct biodiversity.
"
Nini ezali ezaleli ya bisanga mikemike te na Afrika ya est? ,"Based on the text provided, the correct answer is **C: Lokumu mpo na banyama ya zamba**

The text mentions:

*   Independence for some of the islands.
*   Association with France for some islands.
*   They are known for their valuable coasts (implying beautiful places).

The text doesn't mention fame for wildlife.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ndenge nini Pasika esalemaka na mangomba mosusu mingimingi ya bonkoko?","The text mentions the following about traditional Easter celebrations:

*   **Staying up all night to see the sunrise:** This is described as a custom, possibly linked to pre-Christian spring celebrations.
*   **Holding Easter Vigil on Saturday night:**  Many older churches do this, celebrating Christ's resurrection around midnight.

Therefore, the answer options that best reflect how Easter is traditionally celebrated according to the text are:

*   **B: Koyamba butu ya bokengeli na mokolo ya Mposo (Holding vigil on Saturday night)**
*   **D: Kotala ndenge moyi ezali kobima (Watching the sunrise)**

The text also mentions the potential for a spring festival connection, but it's presented as a possible origin of the sunrise custom, not necessarily a separate, distinct part of the current celebration. Option C, ""Kosala feti ya printemps mpo na lisanga"", is also likely true, but not the best answer from the available options.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **B and D.**"
"Mpo na koboya masengami mosusu ntango azali kokota na Équateur, mwana mboka ya Cuba asengeli liboso kozala na nini?","The correct answer is **D: Carte verte ya États-Unis (Green Card of the United States)**

"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kosenga mbongo mingi na mboka mopaya koleka na ndako?","Based on the provided text, the answer is **B: Montures ya likolo (High-end frames)**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that high-end frames ""ezali na bisika oyo ekoki kozala na makambo mibale; mosusu ekoki kozala ya mabe, mpe ya solo eza oyo euta mikili mosusu kasi ekoki kozala talo mingi koleka oyo basala na ndako."" This translates to: ""High-end frames are in places that may have two issues; some may be bad, and the real ones are those from other countries but may be more expensive than those made at home."" This indicates that high-end imported frames are more likely to be expensive in a foreign country.

The other options are less likely to be more expensive abroad:

*   **A: Kotala miso miso (Eye exam):** The text mentions that eye exams might be cheaper abroad due to lower labor costs. It also suggests getting one at home if it's covered by insurance.
*   **C: Assurance ya miso (Eye insurance):** Eye insurance is generally region specific so not particularly relevant here.
*   **D: Montures oyo ezali na nkombo te (Non-branded frames):** The text implies that generic frames are cheaper abroad where manufacturing costs are cheaper.

Therefore, the most logical answer is **B**.
"
Nini ekoki kozala likama oyo ekoki kobima soki ozali kosomba ba cadres ya lokumu na mboka mopaya?,"Based on the passage, the potential downside of buying higher-end frames is that:

*   The passage says ""Bakadre ya kitoko ya likolo ezali na bisika oyo ekoki kozala na makambo mibale; mosusu ekoki kozala ya mabe, mpe ya solo eza oyo euta mikili mosusu kasi ekoki kozala talo mingi koleka oyo basala na ndako."" which translates to ""Higher-end frames have places where they might have dual problems; one might be bad, the truest one is from other countries but more expensive than those made at home.""

Therefore the correct answer is **C: Ekoki kozala ya malamu** (It can be good)

The rest of the answers are not directly supported by the passage:

*   **A: Ekoki kosenga basala ekzame mosusu ya miso (It might require another eye exam):** While it mentions getting an eye exam, it doesn't link this *specifically* to buying higher-end frames in another country.
*   **B: Ordonnance ekoki kosala te mpo na bamonture mosusu (The prescription may not work for other frames):** This isn't mentioned.
*   **D: Ekoki kozala ete assurance ekoki kofuta mbongo yango te (It may be that the insurance may not cover the amount):** While insurance is mentioned for the eye exam, there's nothing about it *not* covering foreign frames."
"Na oyo etali kosalela mbongo na Malouines, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali solo?","The correct answer is **D: Longola mbongo ya Falkland, mbala mingi livre ya Angleterre ezali mbongo oyo endimami mingi.**

Here's why:

*   **A: Kaka bacarte ya mbongo mpe mbongo ya Angleterre nde endimami na bisanga oyo ezali mosika** - The text says debit cards are ""not always"" accepted and that US dollars *might* be accepted, so this statement is not entirely correct.
*   **B: Stanley ezali esika se moko oyo ekondima dollar ya États-Unis** - The text says US dollars are ""often accepted"" in Stanley, and are sometimes accepted in other regions. So this statement is not entirely correct.
*   **C: Esengeli kopesana mbongo ya Falkland nsima ya kolongwa na bisanga** - The text states that it is ""difficult"" to exchange Falkland pounds *outside* the islands. Therefore, you should exchange the money *before* leaving the islands.
*   **D: Longola mbongo ya Falkland, mbala mingi livre ya Angleterre ezali mbongo oyo endimami mingi** - The text says that Sterling pounds are ""accepted everywhere"" on the islands, and they are also more likely to be accepted than US dollars on islands further away. So this statement is correct."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango ozali kosala mobembo wuta États-Unis kino Malouines, wapi lolenge mosusu ya kofuta longola kaka karte ya kredi ekoki kozala na ntina mingi?","The correct answer is **C: Na bisanga ya libanda**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that debit cards are ""not always accepted"" in the ""outer islands."" It also mentions that British pounds and US dollars might be accepted, so these would be useful alternatives to a credit card."

**A: Mbotama ya nzoku**
"
Epai wapi tokoki komona banzoku oyo ba decorer?,"The best answer is **C: Namilulu na feti ya tempelo**

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Bafete ya tempelo ya Kerala ezalaka kitoko mingi na kotala, mpo balekisaka banzoku oyo bakomisi kitoko...""  This directly links decorated elephants to temple festivals.
* **A is too broad:** While the timeframe is mentioned, it doesn't guarantee seeing decorated elephants everywhere during that period.
* **B is too general:** While the festivals occur at temples, the specific act of seeing the decorated elephants is during the festivals.
* **D is not directly supported:** The passage doesn't say they are in the streets of Kerala generally, but rather specifically at the temple festivals.

Therefore, C is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage.

*   The most obvious way to travel in first class or business is to pay a lot for it (or have your company pay).
*   It's usually not worth asking for discounts on business or first-class fares for direct flights.

Based on this, the best way to save money is to have your company pay.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Kosalela mbongo na nzela ya kopanyi na yo** (Using your company's money)

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekozala kolekisa ntango mpamba mpo na koluka ntango ozali kozua esika na mpepo ya bakelasi mosusu ya ntalo?","Correct Answer: C

The passage specifically states: ""Mbala mingi, esengaka kutu te kosenga bakitisa talo esika babengaka ya bato ya mombongo to na esika ya bokonzi pa na bampepo ya mbala moko banda na A kino na B."" This translates to: ""Often, there's no need to even ask for discounts in business or first class on direct flights from A to B."" This indicates that trying to negotiate a lower price in business or first class is generally a waste of time. The passage also mentions that airlines are fully aware of the demand and are not likely to lower prices."

"Na kotalela makomi oyo eleki, bazando ya minene babandi kopesa koleka na lolenge ndenge na ndenge?","The correct answer is **A: Bilei oyo esili kobongisama** (Prepared foods).

The passage explicitly states:

*   ""Mbala mingi, bazando ya minene ezokoma na biteni oyo batekaka bilei basi balamba."" (Often, large supermarkets have sections that sell pre-cooked/prepared foods).

The other options are also mentioned in the passage, but ""Bilei oyo esili kobongisama"" is a broad category that encompasses the specific examples given.
"
Biloko nini ya malamu oyo bamagazini mosusu ya minene epesaka ekoki kosepelisa kiliya oyo azali kosomba bilei oyo esili kobongisama?,"The passage mentions that some large grocery stores have ""four à micro-ondes to lolenge mosusu ya kokomisa bilei moto"" (microwave ovens or other ways to heat food). This is most closely related to option D.

Therefore, the answer is **D: four à micro-ondes moko**

Na likambo nini mbala mosusu bakopesa yo mbongo ya mobembo mpo na liwa?,"The correct answer is **D: Soki ozali kopumbwa Delta**.

The passage states that Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa, and WestJet offer bereavement fares. Option D is the only one that mentions one of these airlines.
"
Nini ezali solo na ntina na mbongo ya mobembo mpo na liwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Bazali kofuta mbongo ya mobembo ya matanga**.

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states that airlines offer ""bereavement fares, which slightly discount the rate for immediate family members"".
*   The paragraph also says to reserve by phone.

Therefore, the other options are incorrect because:

*   The paragraph tells you to call, not go online.
*   The travel is needed promptly."
Ntango nini kosalela aparɛyi ya GPS oyo ezali yango moko ekozala malamu koleka programɛ ya kosala na nzela ya GPS?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntango ozali kokende libanda ya portée (When you are going out of range)**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Soki oza te na basango oyo eza connecte na telefone na yo, to soki eza mosika, ekosala malamu te to ekosala te."" This directly translates to ""If you don't have signal connected to your phone, or if it is far, it won't work well or it won't work at all."" This means a GPS app on your phone is unreliable when you're out of signal range. A standalone GPS device, on the other hand, might still work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ntango ozali koluka kobomba mbongo (When you are trying to save money):** The passage states that using a GPS app can save you money. So, the opposite is true.
* **B: Ntango oyebi mpenza ete okozala na ndenge ya kozua nsango (When you know for sure that you will have signal):** If you have a signal, a GPS app works well. This is when using a GPS app would be good, not when a standalone device would be better.
* **D: Ntango olingi ko louer appareil te (When you don't want to rent a device):** This is a reason to use a GPS app, not a standalone GPS device.
"
Nini ezali ntina malamu te ya kosalela appli ya navigation GPS na bokeseni na aparɛyi oyo ezali yango moko?,"The correct answer is **A: Esengeli te komitungisa mpo na ndenge ya kozua nsango**.

Here's why:

* **The original text says:** ""...Soki oza te na basango oyo eza connecte na telefone na yo, to soki eza mosika, ekosala malamu te to ekosala te.""  This translates to ""If you don't have a signal connected to your phone, or if it's far away, it won't work well or at all."" This implies a problem with signal. Therefore, you'll need to worry about getting information.
* **Options B, C, and D** are all listed as potential benefits of using a phone GPS app instead of standalone GPS devices.

Therefore, the statement that is NOT a benefit, and is rather a potential drawback, is that you *do* have to worry about signal (getting information).

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, mosani ya masano ya mbongo ya mayele asengeli kokima nini?","The correct answer is **A: Komela masanga mingi** (Drinking too much alcohol).

The passage states that alcohol impairs judgment, and good judgment is essential for gambling. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Kondima ba incentives nionso** (Accepting all incentives) - While casinos use incentives, the passage doesn't directly say a smart gambler should avoid *all* of them. Some might be beneficial.
*   **C: Kotala ba horloges to ba montres** (Looking at clocks or watches) - The absence of clocks and windows is a tactic by the casino, but not something the gambler needs to actively avoid.
*   **D: Kotuna na ntina ya esika ya kobima oyo ezali penepene** (Asking about the nearest exits) - This is a smart thing to do for situational awareness, not something to avoid."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, eteni nini ya elobeli ekomami na makomi minene na katikati ya phrase?","The answer is **B: Bankombo** (Nouns).

The passage clearly states that only nouns (bankombo) are capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence, to distinguish them from verbs and other parts of speech.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekokaki kosala ete kokoma bankombo na makomi minene ezala mpasi mingi?","The correct answer is **C: kokoma**.

The passage states: ""kokoma eza mwa mpasi mpo esengaka koyeba soki verbe to adjectif ebongi mpenza na ndenge wana"" which translates to ""writing is a bit difficult because you need to know if the verb or adjective is indeed appropriate in that way"". This directly answers the question of what makes writing nouns with capital letters difficult.
"
"Na bamboka ya Malaisie, geste nini elimboli “koya likolo”?","The correct answer is **B: Koningisa loboko** because the passage states that waving in Malaysia means ""come here"". Therefore, ""koya likolo"" in the context of the question is best interpreted as ""come here.""
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, geste nini ekoki kolimbola “kozonga”?","The correct answer is **A: Koningisa loboko na loboko etali na kati**.

The text specifically states that ""kopepa loboko ya kopesa mbote, loboko ezotala moto apesi mbote (na esika etala moto oyo bazopepa) elimboli kozonga.""  This means waving with the palm facing the person who is waving (inward) can be misinterpreted as ""go away"" in Spain.
"
"Na kotalela oyo eleki,  nini esalaka ete mabele epasuka?","The answer is **A: Gbagba ya mbula-mpembe** (Avalanche).

The passage states that avalanches cause the ground to crack.

"Kolandana na bokomi, oyo wapi kati na yango ekoki kobombama na gbagba ya mbula-mpembe?","The passage says ""...ebimisaka mabulu, oyo bagbagba ya neige oyo ekoki kobomba yango mpo emonana te."" This directly states that the ""mabulu"" (holes) can be hidden by snowdrifts. ""Mabulu ya glace"" in the question translates to ""glacier holes"", which is the same as ""mabulu"".

So the correct answer is:

**B: Mabulu ya glace**
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, bato oyo basalaka mibembo basengeli kosala makambo mosusu liboso ya kokende na esika nini?","The correct answer is **B: Bitando oyo ezali zingazinga ya Goma**.

The passage states that tourists should research the ongoing conflicts in the North Kivu province before visiting Goma. North Kivu is the region surrounding Goma, making ""Bitando oyo ezali zingazinga ya Goma"" the most accurate answer.
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekozala toli malamu te mpo na touriste na Goma?","Toli oyo ekoki kozala malamu te mpo na touriste na Goma ezali:

Ntango nini ndingisa ya nsima ya mboka mpo na mokolo ya kobanda na sanza ya mwambe ekobanda kozwama?,"The passage states that permits are available starting on the 1st day of the year, four months before the month of commencement.

The question asks about a commencement date in August. Four months prior to August is April. So, permits for August commencement dates become available on the 1st of January.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: 1 sanza ya yambo janvier**.
"
Politiki nini ezali mpo na kobatela ngomba?,"The correct answer is **A: Système ya ndingisa ya koya liboso, oyo akozwa liboso**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that permits are required for camping below the rim of the Grand Canyon.
*   It emphasizes that these permits are limited to protect the canyon.
*   It mentions that campsites, especially popular ones, fill up quickly due to high demand as soon as permit applications open.
*   It indicates a priority system, where permits are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis.

The other options are either inaccurate or incomplete based on the passage:

*   **B: Ndingisa ezali kaka na 1 sanza ya yambo:** While permits become available on January 1st, this isn't the *only* time they are available, just when they initially open for applications.
*   **C: Mikanda ya ndingisa ekoki kozwama kaka na nzela ya aosengi ya kokota:** The passage does not specify where permits can be obtained.
*   **D: Motango moke ya mikanda ya ndingisa:** While correct, it is a small detail and the priority based system is more important.

"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kozwama mingi te na lolenge ya ba otɛlɛ oyo elobelami na mokapo yango?","The correct answer is **D: Bisika ya kolala oyo euti kobongisama sika na bibongisi ya mikolo oyo.**

Here's why:

*   The passage describes hotels from a historical perspective, focusing on their luxurious amenities and service during the golden age of travel (19th-early 20th century). It specifically mentions fine dining and nightlife.
*   Options A, B, and C are all aspects commonly associated with this type of upscale, historical hotel experience:
    *   **A: Esika ya masanga (A Bar):** Upscale hotels in that era would almost certainly have a bar or lounge.
    *   **B: Esika ya kolia oyo eyebani (A well-known restaurant):** Fine dining was a key feature.
    *   **C: Baninga bapaya oyo bayebani malamu (Distinguished guest acquaintances):** These hotels catered to the wealthy and elite, fostering a social scene.
*   **D: Bisika ya kolala oyo euti kobongisama sika na bibongisi ya mikolo oyo (Newly renovated accommodations with modern amenities):** While some historical hotels may have been renovated, the *core concept* conveyed in the passage is about hotels that *historically* featured luxury and elegance. The passage actually mentions ""modele ya kozanga biloko euti kobima sika"", which suggests that brand new, modern amenities are **not** the defining characteristic of the hotels being described.

Therefore, modern, newly renovated rooms are the least likely to be emphasized in the hotels described in the passage."
"Na kotalela makambo oyo mapesami na mokapo, makabo nini kati na makabo oyo elandi, bapaya ya hotel bakotya na esika ya liboso mingi te?","Based on the passage, the least likely priority for hotel guests, especially the wealthy traveler described, is **D: Ntalo ya esika ya kolala ezali malamu (Affordable room rate).**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the historical opulence and exclusivity of these hotels.** They were destinations for the wealthy, known for fine dining and nightlife.
* **The modern traveler mentioned is described as someone who can afford worldwide air travel.**  This suggests price sensitivity is less of a concern.
* **Options A, B, and C all align with the description of the hotels' historical features and amenities:**  Antique furnishings, gourmet dining, and entertainment are all things you'd expect a wealthy traveler to prioritize in this context.

Therefore, the most logical answer is D.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini esengeli koboya na bato oyo bazali kosala mibembo oyo bazali kokende kotala Greenland?","The correct answer is **D: Kolobelaka moto moko ya mboka Greenland lokola “Eskimo”** (Referring to a person from Greenland as ""Eskimo"").

The passage specifically warns against using the term ""Eskimo,"" even though it might be heard from locals, as it can be considered offensive. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text:

*   **A:** The text does mention mosquitoes being annoying in the summer, not general crime.
*   **B:** The text advises bringing warm clothing, especially for winter travel.
*   **C:** The text suggests the opposite; Greenland has good internet connectivity."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kozala mokakatano mingi mpo na bato oyo bamibongisi te oyo bazali kokende kotala Greenland?","The correct answer is **C: Mopepe** (Wind).

The text specifically states: ""Mopepe ya malili eza likama oyo mbala mosusu kaka bato oyo babongami te nde bakokutana na yango."" (Cold wind is a danger that only unprepared people are likely to encounter.)

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Ngongi ya mikili ya Nord (Northern Mosquitoes):** While the text mentions mosquitoes can be annoying, it does not say they are a *major* danger for unprepared people.
*   **B: Mbeba (Error):** This option is not relevant to the provided text.
*   **D: Batu ya mboka (Locals):** The text explicitly states that prejudice and aggression towards tourists are rare in Greenland."
"Na oyo elandi, oyo wapi esalelami sikawa lokola esika ya monene ya katikati?","The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text clearly states that Jardín de la Unión ""ezosala lokola esika monene ya plaza"" (now serves as a large plaza).
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezwami te na Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **B: Ndako ya lisolo ya bolingo ya kala** (A house of an old love story).

Here's why:

*   **Jardín de la Unión** is described as a large plaza with frequent events (which includes concerts), surrounded by restaurants and originally the site of a convent (only the Templo de San Diego remains).
*   **Callejon del Beso** (Alley of the Kiss) is the place described to have the house of an old love story.

Therefore, only option B refers to a place that is not Jardín de la Unión, but Callejon del Beso.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango nini kotambola na bangomba ya mokolo moko esɛngaka komibongisa mpenza moke?","The correct answer is **B: Ntango esɛngaka nzela ya kotambola oyo ezali facile koleka.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...mpona mokolo ya kotambola na nzela moko ya pete, komibongisa moke eza ntina..."" (For a day of hiking on an easy trail, a little preparation is necessary...) This directly links easy trails with requiring less preparation.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **A: Ntango moto oyo azali kotambola na bangomba azali nzoto kolongono (When the person hiking is healthy):** While being healthy is helpful, the passage focuses on the *difficulty of the trail* as the determining factor for preparation, not necessarily the hiker's fitness.
* **C: Tango bana bazali kokende kotambola (When children are going hiking):** The passage states that when hiking with children, *more* preparation is needed, not less.
* **D: Tango kotambola ezali na environnement plus naturel (When hiking is in a more natural environment):**  The passage doesn't directly link a more natural environment with less preparation.  A natural environment could potentially *require* more preparation, depending on the terrain and remoteness.
"
Nini ekeseni na bisika ya plateau na Rogaland to na Agder soki tokokanisi yango na mikili mosusu ya Norvège?,"The correct answer is **D: Mbala mingi, ezipaka yango na ba bruyères**

The text says: ""Na Rogaland pe na Agder, babengaka bango mbala mingi """"hei"""" oyo elimboli nzela ezangi banzete oyo **mbala mingi ezalaka na babruyère**."" This directly states that the plateaus in Rogaland and Agder are often covered in heather (bruyères).
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, kati na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekozala ya momeseno te mpo na Norvège?","Based on the provided text, the answer is **B: Babwaku oyo ezali na bazamba**.

Here's why:

*   **Fjords (Babongo ya mabanga) (C)** and **Mabwaku (D)** are explicitly mentioned as characteristic features of Norway.
*   **Bitando ya mabele oyo ezali polele (A)** or ""vidde"" and ""hei"" are described as large, treeless expanses, which is also a characteristic of the Norwegian landscape.
*   The text describes ""vidde"" and ""hei"" as treeless areas. Therefore, **B: Babwaku oyo ezali na bazamba (Valleys with forests)** would be *less* typical of the specific landscapes being discussed in the passage. While forests exist in Norway, the text emphasizes treeless plateaus."
Ntango nini ba touristes oyo balingi kosala ski basengeli kokende na ba gares ya bangomba?,"A: Na ntango ya malili

Explanation: The passage says that during winter, many mountain locations have heavy snow, which allows for activities like skiing and snowboarding. Therefore, tourists who want to ski should visit mountain resorts during the winter season.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, mbala mingi ntango nini baturiste bazalaka mingi na bisika ya kozela ya bangomba?","The correct answer is **C: Na ntango ya moi makasi (Na eleko ya molunge)**

The passage states that tourists visit mountain resorts to escape the heat during the summer months in India (""eleko ya molunge""). Therefore, ""Na ntango ya moi makasi"" (during the hot season) is the most accurate answer.
"
Nini osengeli koboya kosala soki ozali na elikya ya kozwa masuwa oyo ezali koluka lisalisi?,"The correct answer is **D: Kozanga koyeba baninga oyo basalaka autostop ya masuwa**.

Here's why:

The passage describes actions you *should* take to find a boat job at a marina:

*   **P**:  ""If you go to the marinas, everything will become clear. You'll meet other people and they'll share information with you... you'll post your wanted ads, wander around the dock, offer to wash boats... try to meet boat crews at bars, and so on. Try to talk to them as much as you can. After a while everyone will know you and tell you what boats are looking for someone.""

Therefore, the one thing the passage does *not* suggest as a helpful action to finding a boat job is:

*   **D: Kozanga koyeba baninga oyo basalaka autostop ya masuwa (Being unaware of fellow boat hitchhikers)**

The other options all align with the advice given:

*   **A: Kotambola likoló mpe na nse na ba quais (Wandering up and down the docks)** - This is explicitly suggested.
*   **B: Kosala boninga na ba capitaines (Making friends with captains)** - This is implied by ""talking to crews at bars"" and ""getting to know people.""
*   **C: Kosakolala misala na yo (Advertising your services)** - This is directly stated as ""posting your wanted ads""."
Nini osengeli kosala zingazinga ya ba marinas ntango ozali koluka masuwa oyo ezali na mposa ya lisalisi?,"The correct answer is **A: Sala boyokani na bato oyo basalaka na masuwa**.

The passage emphasizes the importance of networking and making connections with people at the marinas to find a sailing job. This is exactly what ""Sala boyokani na bato oyo basalaka na masuwa"" (Make connections with people who work on boats) means.  The other options are contrary to the advice given in the passage.
"
Esika nini ekosepelisa motamboli oyo asepeli na makambo ya kala y aba oyo bakonzaki esanga?,"The correct answer is **A: Libongo ya Nord**.

The passage states: ""Bokoli mingi ya bamboka ya esanga ya Hong Kong etonda mpenza na mabele oyo ezalaka na ndambu ya nordi ya libongo. Wana eza esika oyo bato ya Grande Bretagne oyo bakonzaki babotolaki, yango wana soki ozoluka bilembeteli ya makambo ya kala ya bato bakonzaki na teritware wana, oyo eza esika ya malamu ya kobanda."" This clearly indicates that the northern part of the harbor is the best place to find historical evidence of British colonial rule.
"
Esika nini ekosepelisa mopaya oyo atyaka na esika ya liboso bisika ya kotala ya kokamwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Esanga ya Hong Kong**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that ""Esanga ya Hong Kong epesa nkombo na yango na teritware ya Hong Kong mpe eza esika oyo bato mingi oyo bakendaka kotala bamboka ya bapaya balingaka mingi."" This directly indicates it's a popular tourist destination and therefore likely to appeal to a tourist prioritizing sights.
* While Victoria Harbour (A) and the Kowloon waterfront (D) offer views *of* Hong Kong Island, the question asks where the tourist interested in sights would be *most* interested in *going*. The passage clearly indicates Hong Kong Island itself.
* ""Hong Kong mpenza"" (B) is too vague. The question is about a specific location.
"
Nini mabulu ya punda mosusu ezali na yango mpo na kosalisa mpo na kokitisa likama ya lokolo ya mokumbi mpunda kokangama na motambo?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is:

**B: Mabende ya libateli** (Safety Bars)

The text specifically mentions ""bakiti ya baAnglais, eza na banzete ya libateli oyo esalisaka eloko moko ya cuir na kokwea na kiti soki babendi yango na nsima na momemi-mpunda oyo ezokwea."" This translates to ""English saddles have safety bars that help a leather element fall from the saddle if pulled backward by a falling rider."" These safety bars are designed to release the stirrup leather, preventing the rider's foot from getting trapped.
"
Eloko nini ya botte ya komata esalisaka mpo na kobakisa libateli ya mokumbi motuka ntango azali kosalela bitanda?,"The correct answer is **C: talon moko** (a heel).

The passage states that riders often wear boots with a good heel (""talon ya malamu"") to increase safety when using stirrups.
"
Nini Lisanga ya boyambi epesaka basali mobembo?,"The correct answer is **A: Bisika ya kolala na bayambi ya mboka**.

The text clearly states that hospitality exchanges connect travelers with locals in the cities they are visiting, and that the exchange involves people offering a place to stay.

Here's why:

* The passage states that families with children sometimes encounter problems at youth hostels. While some hostels allow them in private rooms, they are not the primary clientele.  The other options (young adults in their 20s, solo travelers, and people in their 30s) are all mentioned as being more common at youth hostels.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nani azali na likoki mingi ya kofanda na auberge?","Réponse B: Bana misato ya mbula 22 bazali kosala mobembo elongo.

Statement P describes youth hostels as being mostly for young people around their 20s. While other groups might be found there, the primary target are young adults. Option B is the group that best fits that description. The other options are less likely:

*   A: Families with babies are less common, and the statement indicates families can have problems.
*   C: Elderly couples are less common.
*   D: Families are less common, and the statement indicates families can have problems."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali kolimbola na bosikisiki kobwaka boomerang?","The correct answer is **D: Kaka ba boomerangs mosusu nde ekoki kozonga**.

"
"Na biloko oyo elandi, oyo wapi esalelamaka mingimingi na bilei ya Java?","The correct answer is **C: Sukali ya mbila** (Sukali ya coco ya Javanais).

The text specifically mentions ""sukali ya coco ya Javanais"" (Javanese coconut sugar), which translates to coconut sugar. Coconut sugar is made from the sap of coconut palm flowers. ""Mbila"" translates to palm or coconut palm in this context.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ndenge nini maladi oyo ezwamaka na bato epalanganaka?","The correct answer is **B: Bamicrobe oyo epesaka maladi**.

"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini eyebani te ete epesaka bokono ya kozwama?","The correct answer is **A: Kopesa mangwele**

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly lists viruses, bacteria, and fungi (mayebo) as pathogens that cause infectious diseases.
*   The text mentions vaccination requirements but doesn't state that vaccines themselves cause infectious diseases. Instead, vaccines are typically used to prevent them."

"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ya Izmir ebandaki liboso ya mikolo na biso?","The correct answer is **D: Bansamba ya ndako oyo etiami batwili ya motani**.

The passage states that Izmir was formerly the ancient Smyrna. It then describes the modern city, contrasting modern features like ""grand boulevards,"" ""glass-fronted buildings,"" and ""modern shopping centers"" with older features like ""red-tiled roofs,"" ""18th-century markets,"" and ""old mosques and churches.""

Red-tiled roofs are presented as part of the older architecture, while the other options are clearly modern developments. Therefore, red-tiled roofs existed before modern Izmir, dating back to the ancient Smyrna.
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali ezaleli ya sikisiki ya Izmir te?","The correct answer is **B: atmosphère ezali komonisa Turquie traditionnelle** (The atmosphere reflects traditional Turkey).

The passage explicitly states: ""atako engumba ezalaka na bizaleli ya Mediterane kasi ya Turquie ya kala te"" (although the city has Mediterranean characteristics but not of ancient Turkey). This directly contradicts option B. The other options are supported by the text.
"
Liloba hanami ezali kolobela kotala nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Fololo ya cerisier** (Cherry blossom).

The passage states: ""Kotala bafololo cerisier, oyo eyebani na nkombo ya hanami..."" which translates to ""Cherry blossom viewing, which is known as hanami...""
"
Nani ayambaki bafeti ya liboso oyo epesamaki mpo na kotala bafololo ya cerise?,"The correct answer is **C: Mokonzi ya Japon** (The Emperor of Japan).

The passage states: ""Na Japon, bafete ya liboso ya bafololo ebengami cerisier, emperere ye moko moto azalaki kobongisa yango..."" which translates to ""In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals, the Emperor himself organized them...""

"
"Na kati ya makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobelami te na mokapo lokola eloko oyo Yelusaleme eyebani mpo na yango?","The correct answer is **B: Bopusi ya politiki**.

The paragraph mentions Yeruzalemi's status as the capital of Israel and the international disagreement on this, but it doesn't specifically highlight ""political influence"" as a defining characteristic Yeruzalemi is known for. Instead, it focuses on its historical significance, religious importance, and cultural attractions. The other options are directly supported by the text:
* A: Lisolo ya bato oyo ezali kobenda likebi - The paragraph states ""Engumba ya kala ya Yudea oyo ezalaka na ngomba moke eza na lisolo ya kitoko oyo ezolobela bankoto ya bambula.""
* C: Ndimbola na makambo ya losambo - The paragraph states ""Engumba eza mosantu mpona mangomba misato - Bayuda, Baklisto pe Bamizlma, mpe ezala esika ya monene ya elimo, ya losambo, mpe ya mimeseno ya kala.""

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, lolenge nini ya motu ya mobembo akozwa matomba te soki asombi Carte Sauvage?","The correct answer is **B: Mobembo moko oyo azali kotala kaka Parc national ya Kruger** (A traveler who is only visiting Kruger National Park).

Here's why:

*   **Wild Card benefits those visiting multiple parks:** The passage states the Wild Card allows access to a *group* of South African parks or *all* South African parks. If someone is *only* visiting Kruger, a Wild Card, which covers multiple parks, would not be cost-effective.

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mobembo oyo azali kokana kotala ba SANParks mingi soki likoki ezali** (A traveler planning to visit many SANParks if possible): This traveler would absolutely benefit from a Wild Card as it would likely save them money compared to paying individual entrance fees.
*   **C: Mbongo ya kosala na mobembo amibanzabanzaka mpo na lifuti ya parc** (A budget-conscious traveler concerned about park fees): A Wild Card can offer significant savings for frequent park visitors, making it a beneficial option.
*   **D: Motu ya mobembo oyo azali kotandisa kotala Kruger National Park mpe ata parc mosusu moko** (A traveler planning to visit Kruger National Park and at least one other park): This traveler might benefit from a Wild Card as it could save them money compared to paying individual entrance fees for both parks.

Therefore, the traveler who would *not* benefit from purchasing a Wild Card is someone exclusively visiting Kruger National Park."
Liloba nini elimboli na bosikisiki te Parc national ya Kruger?,"The correct answer is **B: Banyama ya zamba ekeseni na kati ya ba écozones ebele ya parc**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Parke ezali 19 500 km² pe ekabwani na biteni 14 ekesene, eteni mokomoko esungaka banyama ya ndenge na ndenge."" This directly translates to ""The park is 19 500 km² and is divided into 14 different parts, each part supports different animals.""

"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kobimisa likama mingi mpo na bato oyo bamataka ngomba na biteni nyonso ya ngomba oyo ezali na mabangamabanga?","The correct answer is **A: Makambo ya mai (Wet conditions)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically warns about being careful in ""biteni ya mabe, mingimingi soki oza na mai, po ezokoma likama noki."" This indicates that wet conditions pose a significant danger.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Matambe ya mabanga (Stone steps):** While stone steps can be challenging, the passage mentions handrails and safety measures that have been taken to help protect people.
*   **C: Mabulu mikemike (Small cave):** While the small cave could be a bit difficult due to the low ceiling and pressure, the passage doesn't explicitly state it's a major hazard.
*   **D: Basinga ya bibende (Steel cables):** Steel cables are in place to help people to navigate the rocky areas, so they are not going to be a hazard.

**Therefore, wet conditions are identified as the greatest potential hazard in the described section of the mountain.**"
"Na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali komonisa na bosikisiki te bomati ya ngomba Machu Picchu oyo elobelami na mokapo yango?","The correct answer is **B: Ezali na baporte ya maboko te na biteni nyonso oyo ezali na nse mingi.**

Here's why:

* **A: Ata bato oyo bazali na nzoto kolɔngɔnɔ mpo na komata ngomba bakozanga mpema:** The passage states ""mizela ete pema ekatana,"" meaning expect to be out of breath, even for fit people. This is true.
* **C: Osengeli koleka na libulu moko oyo ezali na likoló:** The passage says ""Eza na libulu ya moke pene ya likolo oyo basengeli koleka,"" meaning you have to pass through a small cave near the top. This is true.
* **D: Biteni oyo ezali na nse mingi ekómaka likama ntango ezali na mai:** The passage says ""mingimingi soki oza na mai, po ezokoma likama noki,"" implying that wet conditions make the climb treacherous. This is true.
* **B: Ezali na baporte ya maboko te na biteni nyonso oyo ezali na nse mingi:** The passage says ""Batia mabongo ya kotambolela pene ya banzela mingi, mpe na bisika oyo mabulu eza mingi, bansinga ya acier ezalaka mpona kosimba na maboko,"" which states that handrails are placed along most trails, and ropes are present in areas with deep crevices. This implies that handrails and ropes are **not** present on all steep sections and therefore, this answer choice represents something that is **not** accurately described in the passage.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na kati ya biloko yango, oyo wapi ezali bilei ya ntina mingi te na bilei ya Majorque?","Based on the text, here's the breakdown:

*   **Mapa (Lipa):** Explicitly mentioned as a base for Pa amb Oli and thus important.
*   **Bandunda:** Explicitly mentioned as part of the cuisine.
*   **Mosuni (Misuni):** Explicitly mentioned as part of the cuisine, specifically ngulu (pork).
*   **Mbuma (Mbuma):** Not mentioned in the passage as a key ingredient in Majorcan cuisine.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Mbuma**.

"Na kotalela makambo oyo ezali na mokapo yango, maloba nini oyo elobeli bilei ya hangi ezali solo te?","Esengeli topona eyano oyo ezali solo te na kotalela makambo oyo ezali na mokapo. Tokotalela eyano mokomoko:

*   **A: Hangi géothermique esalelaka mabanga ya molunge oyo ewuti na moto mpo na kopelisa libulu yango** - Mokapo elobi ete bakomisaka libulu ya hangi na mabanga ya molunge oyo euti na moto to na bisika mosusu, moto ya mabele esalaka ete esika yango ekoma moto. Yango wana, eyano oyo ezali solo.

Yango wana, eyano oyo ezali solo te ezali **C**."
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobelami te lokola lolenge ya momesano ya kopelisa libulu ya hangi?","The correct answer is **A: Gaz**.

The passage mentions using volcanic rocks (mabanga ya moto) and geothermal heat (molunge géothermique) to heat the hangi pit. While ""mabanga ya moto"" is listed twice, it's still a mentioned method. Gaz is not mentioned in the passage.
"
Nini ekoki kosala ete monganga to sango moko ayebana na ndenge ya special?,"The correct answer is **A: Kolata enveloppe oyo ezipami na kongenga**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that monks or nuns will mock you if you wear clothes with bright colours when visiting monasteries. Wearing a shiny or sparkling wrapper could attract attention and lead to a mocking remark.
*   The other answers:

    *   B: Kozipa mapeka na yo (Covering your shoulders) - This is required, not something that would make you stand out negatively.
    *   C: Kodefa enveloppe na monastère (Borrowing a wrapper at the monastery) - This is a normal practice if you are not properly dressed.
    *   D: Kolata jupe oyo bakati likolo ya genoux (Wearing a skirt above the knees) - This is considered improper attire and is not something that is expected."
"Na bilamba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kozala te mpo na kodefa na monastère? ","The correct answer is **A: Bajupes**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that monasteries often have *clothing to cover up* for women who come unprepared. It also mentions that men need to cover their knees, and that monasteries might have something available to borrow.
* The passage specifically says they have clothing available for women. ""Jupes"" (skirts) are mentioned as something *required* for women to wear, suggesting that women who come without appropriate skirts can borrow them. The same could be said for men, that if the monastery does not have anything for them to borrow, they may be asked to leave. 

Therefore, skirts are something you *would* likely be able to borrow, making option A the opposite of what the question is asking. The other options, are not specified at all, but it is most likely the right answer.
"
Ntango nini mopaya akozala na mabaku mingi ya kotala minzoto ntango azali kotala bisika ya Antarctique?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntango ya sanza ya malili makasi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Soki osali mobembo na arctiques to na antarctiques na eleko ya mpio makasi...elimboli ete moi ebimaka te na likolo. Ezopesa libaku malamu ya komona baaurores boréales... mpe kosepela komona minzoto."" This directly links the cold season (eleko ya mpio makasi) with more opportunities for stargazing because of the extended darkness.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Na ntango ya sanza ya moi makasi:** The passage explains the opposite. The text implies that the sun stays above the horizon during periods of light.
* **B: Ntango esika ezali na batu ebele te:** The passage explains, ""lokolo bisika wana ezalaki na bato mingi te, mpe bisika ezali na bato mingi te ezalaka na makambo mingi te."" This is correct, but not in relation to the timing of the stargazing.
* **D: Ntango nivo ya kobebisa mopepe na mwinda ezali moke:** While low light pollution is beneficial for stargazing, it's not the primary factor highlighted in the passage regarding *when* the most opportunities exist in the Arctic/Antarctic. The darkness of the polar winter is the key reason.
"
Ntango nini telefone ya satellite ekozala te eloko oyo ekoki kozwa esika ya telefone ya mabɔkɔ?,"The correct answer is **A: Soki nzela ya komona na satellite ekoki kopekisama**.

The passage states: ""Mbala mingi telefone ya satelite ezwaka te esika ya telefone ya maboko, mpo osengeli kozala na libanda mpe komona polele nzela ezomema na satelite mpona kobenga."" This directly translates to: ""Satellite phones often don't replace cell phones, because you need to be outside and have a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.""

Therefore, if the line of sight to the satellite is blocked, the satellite phone won't work and cannot replace a regular cell phone.
"
Ntango nini telefone ya satellite ekozala malamu koleka telefone ?,"Eyano ya malamu ezali **B: Na ntango ya mobembo ya masuwa**

Ndenge lisolo elobi, telefone ya satelite basalelamaka mingi na masuwa, ata pe na masuwa ya bisengo, oyo eza na biloko pe mingongo na mosika."
Matata mpo na oyo wapi kati na makambo oyo elandi ememaki na kokela République ya Transnistrie?,"The correct answer is **B: Bikolo** (Ethnicities).

The passage states that Moldova is a multi-ethnic country troubled by ethnic discord (""Moldavie eza mboka oyo eza na bikolo ebele oyo eniokwama na kozanga boyokani ya bikolo.""). This ethnic discord led to the conflict and the subsequent creation of Transnistria.
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi République Transnistrie ezali na yango oyo ekeseni na Moldavie mobimba?  ","The correct answer is **D: Mbongo**.

The passage states that Transnistria ""eza na boyangeli na yango mpe mosolo na yango"" (has its own government and currency). It also states that ""ata lisanga moko te oyo eza kati ya ONU endima yango"" which shows that Transnistria is not recognised by the UN.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lokota (Language):** The passage says the national language of Moldova is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian. The passage doesn't state whether or not Romanian or Russian is spoken in Transnistria.
*   **B: Losambo (Religion):** The passage states that the main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity. There's no indication that Transnistria differs in this aspect.
*   **C: Bondimi ya ONU (UN Recognition):** While it is true that Transnistria is not recognised by the UN, the question asks what Transnistria *has* that is different, not what it *lacks*. The lack of UN recognition isn't something Transnistria possesses; it's a status it *doesn't* have.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango nini mobembo asengeli kokende na Montevideo soki azali na elikya ya kokima makambo ya mopepe?","The correct answer is **D: Na basanza ya eleko ya été ya Montevideo**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Montevideo is south of the equator.
* It says that when it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it's winter in Montevideo (and vice versa).
* It describes the winter in Montevideo as having ""false cold,"" meaning the temperature doesn't drop below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel much colder.

Therefore, to avoid the wind and cold, a traveler should go to Montevideo during their summer months, which are the same as the Northern Hemisphere's winter months. Option D, which describes Montevideo's summer months, is the correct answer.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango nini mobembo asengeli kokende kotala Montevideo soki bazali ndambo na klima ya malili?","Mpo na kozwa eyano malamu, tosengeli kokanisa biloko oyo maloba mazali koloba.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi kati na makambo oyo elandi ekozala na boyokani na mosali ya graffiti oyo ayebani mingi, na bokeseni na kobebisama?","Based on the text, the answer is **A: Makambo ya kosala ba graffiti** (Acts of creating graffiti).

Here's why:

*   The text distinguishes between vandalism (tagging and destruction with aerosol paint) and ""real"" graffiti art, which is larger, more elaborate, and often found in designated areas.

*   Option A aligns with the idea of creating graffiti as an art form, as opposed to the destructive acts described earlier.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   B: Kokoma na makomi (Writing in script) - This is too broad and doesn't necessarily distinguish between art and vandalism.
*   C: Ba fresques oyo elingi te na biloko ya leta (Unwanted frescoes on public property) - While some graffiti might be considered unwanted, the key is the intentionality and artistic nature. A ""graffiti artist"" would ideally be creating art, not just defacing property.
*   D: Ba étiquettes oyo ekoki kotangama te (Illegible tags) - The text explicitly contrasts the artist's work with tags."
Likambo nini ya bafɛti ya miziki oyo bayangani mosusu batalelaka lokola eteni ya ntina mingi mpo na likambo yango?,"The correct answer is **B: Kosala kaa na esika yango**.

The passage states: ""Mpona bafeti mosusu, bato mingi oyo bayaka na bafeti ya miziki basepelaka kofanda na esika ya fete, mpe basusu bamonaka ete ezalaka eteni ya ntina mingi ya feti."" This directly translates to ""For some festival-goers, camping at the festival is enjoyed, and some see it as an important part of the festival.""
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini mosali ya festival asengeli kotya na esika ya liboso soki alingi kosala camp pene na miziki?","The correct answer is **D: Kokota liboso ya ngonga** (Arriving early).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: *""Soki olingi kosala pene ya esika makambo ezosalema, osengeli kokende na liboso po esika na yo ezala pene na miziki.""* This translates to *""If you want to camp near the action, you should arrive early to secure your spot close to the music.""*

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Kokende na butu makasi** (Going late at night) - The passage suggests that the main music area's music might end, although some areas will continue, this doesn't directly relate to *getting* to camp near the music, as it only applies to how late music may be playing.
*   **B: Kofanda na esika oyo ezali mpo na mabota** (Camping in the family zone) - The passage implies that the family camping area is separate and specifically for families with young children, and not a primary location for people wanting to camp near the music.
*   **C: Kosala camp libanda ya esika yango** (Camping outside the venue) - The passage doesn't suggest this. It focuses on camping within the festival grounds, closer to the music.

Therefore, arriving early is the most direct way to ensure you can camp close to the music, according to the passage."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, wapi bapaya basengeli kokima tango bazali koluka bomoi ya butu na nord ya Nouveau-Mexique?","The correct answer is **B: Babare ya bamboka ya mike**.

The passage explicitly warns that ""babare ya bamboka ya mike ezalaka te ntango nyonso bisika ya malamu oyo bapaya bauti mboka mosusu basengeli kokende."" This indicates that tourists should avoid these bars.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, wapi mopaya akoki kozwa masano oyo eyebani mingi na nord ya Nouveau-Mexique?","The correct answer is **C: Na casino moko pene na Santa Fe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the casinos mentioned (primarily those around Albuquerque and Santa Fe) have ""games of the best quality"" from major companies.
*   It also says that ""bapueblos mingi eza mosika,"" which means that people would not see most nightlife in the area unless they go to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
*   The passage warns against going to bars in small towns.
*   It also warns against the large number of drunk drivers near city bars.
*   Therefore, the best option for finding quality games is at a casino near Santa Fe."
Bato oyo basalaka mibembo oyo bayebaka budget bakoki kolinga kokima lolenge nini ya masanga?,"The passage states that juice is expensive. Therefore, the answer is:

**D: Jus ya mbuma** (Fruit juice)
"
"Na kotalela esika oyo elobelami na mokapo yango, na ba commandes ya masanga oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kobulunganisa serveur moko?","The most likely order to confuse a server, based on the text, is:

*   **D: Pembe moko ya plat**

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that coffee in Australia is different from what people might be used to: ""'Cafe 'ya mindele' eza ya sika."" (European-style coffee is new). ""Pembe ya plat"" is not one of the common coffee types mentioned. The other options are listed as being common in this area."
"Eumelaki bikeke misato, eleko ya colonisation ebandaki na groupe nini?","The correct answer is **D: Bato ya Espagne** (The Spanish people).

The passage states that ""Bato ya Espagne babandaki eloko ya kokonza oyo eumelaki bikeke misato"" (The Spanish people started a colonial system that lasted three centuries).
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, moyen nini ya malamu ya kosala que parisien a chauffer yo?","Based on the text provided, the best answer is **C: acte ya politesse (acts of politeness)**.

The passage explicitly states that using ""courtoisies de base"" (basic politeness) helps navigate Paris smoothly and avoids negative reactions. Therefore, performing acts of politeness is the most effective way to get a Parisian to warm up to you.
"
"Nakotala oyo eleki, nini na oyo elandi etalelami te lokola bizaleli oyo ba Parisien bazalaka na yango mingi?","The passage mentions:

*   Moimi (Selfish)
*   Kozonga botosi (Disrespectful)
*   Lolendo (Proud)

The passage also mentions that ""Balibanda ya kitoko ya Paris elongwaka noki soki otie mwa biloko babengi courtoisies de base."" which translates to: ""The beautiful facades of Paris disappear quickly if you put a little bit of what are called basic courtesies.""

The passage does **not** mention ""Kolinga kosakana"" (Playfulness).

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Kolinga kosakana**"

Epai wapi bakoki kosomba bakarte ya telefone oyo efutami liboso?,"The answer is **C: Na babutike ya pembeni** (In convenience stores).

The passage states ""Babutiki nyonso ya pene ya balabala etondaki na bakarte ya telefone mingi mpenza..."" which translates to ""All the convenience stores were filled with many phone cards...""
"
Lifuti malamu oyo bacarte mosusu ya telephone epesaka ezalaka ndenge nini?,"The passage states: ""Mbala mingi bato bazwaka misala wana na nzela ya nimero ya telefone ya ofele oyo bakoki kobenga na batelefone mingi ya ofele."" This directly corresponds to option B.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Na nzela ya motango ya ofele**
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, banzete nini kati na banzete oyo elandi ezali mingi te na Parc national ya Plitvice Lakes?","The correct answer is **B: Chêne (Oak)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Plitvice National Park is abundant with hêtres (beech), pinettes (pine) and sapins (fir). While it's possible oak trees are present, they are not mentioned as a dominant species in the provided text, unlike beech, pine, and fir.  ""Épicéa"" is another word for pine.
"
"Na banyama oyo emonanaka mingi te, oyo wapi ekoki kozwama na parke national ya Plitvice Lakes?","The correct answer is **B: Tétra monene** and **D: Tétra monene**.

The text says ""tétras monene"" (which is translated to ""capercaillie"") is found in Plitvice Lakes National Park. The other animals are not mentioned and the Cassowary is not native to Europe.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, bakoode ya esika esalisaka mpenza na nini?","The correct answer is **B: Kolanda nkita (Following the economy/financial gain)**.

The passage argues that the real purpose of regional codes is to give companies more control over the market for financial gain, not to prevent piracy. While C is the justification companies give, the passage claims that's not the *real* purpose.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi na oyo elandi ezali lokuta sur ba codes ya région ezali perpétué na ba entreprises ya médias?","Esengeli topona oyo ezali lokuta, mpo na kolanda makomi ya P.

"
"Ntango okokóma na mboka na yo, mbala mingi mosala nini esalemaka na ndenge ya momeseno te?","The correct answer is **D: Kolanda makambo ya duane**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that customs procedures can be a big hassle (""kolandela makambo ya douane ekoki kozala motungisi monene""). This implies that following customs is a problem, or ""not done smoothly"".
* The other options are all standard immigration/customs procedures that are generally done correctly:
    * **A: Kotala makambo ya immigration** (Checking immigration matters) - This is a fundamental part of entry into any country.
    * **B: Kosakola biloko** (Declaring goods) - This is a standard customs procedure.
    * **C: Bandelo ya mibeko ya biloko** (Legal limits of goods) - Knowing and respecting these limits is important for entering a country.

Therefore, the passage suggests that ""kolanda makambo ya douane"" (following customs procedures) is often the problem.
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi osengeli koyeba liboso ya kokóma na mboka na yo?","The correct answer is **D: Soki biloko oyo ozali komema epesami nzela te.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of knowing what you can and cannot bring into the country.** This directly relates to knowing if the items you're carrying are permitted.
* The other options (A, B, and C) focus on customs procedures. While important, they are secondary to knowing if your items are allowed in the first place. If you're carrying something prohibited, the customs process becomes irrelevant.

"Na kotalela makambo oyo epesami na mokapo yango, nani azali kolobela bisika oyo bakatisi mingi na Hémisphère Sud?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Kasi, Star Alliance ezwaka eteni wana mobimba longola Pacifique ya sudi este banda na Santiago ya Chilie kino Tahiti..."" (But, Star Alliance takes up that whole part except for the southeast South Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti...).
*   This implies that Star Alliance covers a significant portion of travel routes in the Southern Hemisphere, more than the other alliances mentioned (SkyTeam and Oneworld/LATAM).
*   SkyTeam is explicitly stated to not cover any of the three ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere.
*   LATAM Oneworld only covers the route from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti.
*   South Pacific is not an airline alliance, it is a location."
Alliance nini ya ba compagnies aériennes ezo couvrir kokatisa ya océan moke na Hémisphère du Sud?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

The text states: ""Kasi, Star Alliance ezwaka eteni wana mobimba longola Pacifique ya sudi este banda na Santiago ya Chilie kino Tahiti..."" which means Star Alliance covers most of the ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere, except for the specific route mentioned.
"
Ebongiseli nini ya kotambola elongaki Global Running Tours?,"The passage states that Go Running Tours created a network of sightrunning providers and that Running Tours Barcelona and Running Copenhagen are *part* of that network. Running Tours Prague is mentioned as *joining* the network.

Therefore, the organization that created the network is **Go Running Tours**.

So the answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, Go Running Tours esalisaka mpo na kokangisa bibongiseli boni ya ndenge na ndenge ya sightrunning?","The correct answer is **C: douzaines**.

The text states that Global Running Tours, ""Go Running Tours"" has a network of ""bafournisseur mingi ya sightrunning"" which translates to ""many sightrunning providers"" across four continents. While there are about 200 organizations in the world, Go Running Tours has a network of ""many"" - which indicates that it is more than three (D) and less than the total number of organizations in the world (B) or an arbitrary number like four (A). The examples given (Barcelona, Copenhagen, Prague) hint that it is likely in the *dozens*.
"
Touriste asengeli kosala nini soki azali na elikya ya komona guépard polele soki likoki ezali?,"The correct answer is **C: Salela ba jumelles (Use binoculars)**.

Here's why:

*   **P** mentions that seeing certain animals (like leopards) requires good vision aids like ""lunettes ya minene"" which translates to large glasses or binoculars. While the text refers to leopards, the general principle applies: using binoculars will help you see animals, including cheetahs, more clearly.
*   The prompt mentions ""bankoi ya nzoto peto ya mike mpe bankoi ya nzoto peto ya minene bazalaka mingi na kobanga mpe okomona yango malamu soki olati maneti ya minene."" bankoi ya nzoto peto translates to cheetah.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best:

*   **A: Kende na safari ya kotambola na bangomba (Go on a mountain walking safari):** While hiking safaris exist, the text does not provide any specific details about the likelihood of seeing a cheetah in the mountains.
*   **B: Kende kotambola na zamba (Go for a walk in the forest):** The passage mentions safaris exploring the ""bazamba mpe bisobe"" (forests and savannahs), but doesn't say that walking in the forest is the *best* way to see a cheetah.
*   **D: Zwá motuka mpe salelá bisaleli oyo bizali na momeseno (Get a car and use equipment that is customary):** While a car can get you around, customary equipment is not the best way to see a cheetah more clearly than using binoculars.

Therefore, using binoculars is the most direct and helpful action mentioned in the text to improve the chances of seeing a cheetah clearly."
"Nakotala oyo eleki, na banyama oyo balandi, nyama nini mopaya akoki kokutana na yango ntango azali kosala mobembo na safari na motuka?","The passage states that elephants and **dikala** are animals that often approach vehicles. It also mentions leopards are commonly timid.

Therefore the answer is **B: Badikala**
"
"Kolandana na bokomi, nini ekokaki kokitisa ntalo ya mobembo?","According to the passage, the best way to lower the cost of a tour is to form a group of four to six people. Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Kozwa etuluku ya bato minei**.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nani akozala na likoki ya kozwa motuya ya mobembo oyo eleki malamu?","Réponse exacte: **D: Etuluku ya bato mitano**

Explication:

P (passage) emonisi polele ete ba visites ezalaka malamu mpona bituluku ya bato minei to motoba. Na kati ya maponami oyo epesami, kaka etuluku ya bato mitano nde ekokani na motuya wana.

*   **A:** Ba touristes oyo balingi ko mélanger mituka - Libondeli yango eza na ntina te mpo na kotimbola likambo yango.
*   **B:** Etuluku ya bato misato - Etuluku oyo eza mike mingi mpo na kozwa mobembo oyo eleki malamu.
*   **C:** Baninga mibale bazali kosala mobembo elongo - Etuluku oyo eza mike mingi mpo na kozwa mobembo oyo eleki malamu.

"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini esalaki ete San Francisco endimama na mokili mobimba?","The best answer based on the text is **A: Kozala mbala na mbala na mitindo ndenge na ndenge ya mayemi mpe ya bapanzi-nsango.**

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that ""Ndenge balakisaka yango mbala mingi na miziki, na bafilme, na babuku mpe na makambo ya bokoko esalisa mpo engumba mpe bamonima na yango eyebana na mokili mobimba."" This directly supports answer A.

While the other options are also mentioned, they are factors that contribute to San Francisco's popularity as a travel destination and economic hub, but the *reason* for its global recognition is specifically tied to its portrayal in various forms of media.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na maloba oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali solo te?","The correct answer is **D: Nkita etie motema mobimba na tourisme**.

Here's why:

* **A: Esili komonana mbala mingi na bafilme mpe na babuku:** This is true, as the text states ""Ndenge balakisaka yango mbala mingi na miziki, na bafilme, na babuku mpe na makambo ya bokoko esalisa mpo engumba mpe bamonima na yango eyebana na mokili mobimba."" (It is often depicted in music, movies, books, and culture, which helps the city and its monuments become known worldwide.)

* **B: Bilei ya Asie epalangani mingi:** This is true, as the text mentions ""San Francisco eza mpe moko ya bisika ya kitoko mingi ya mboka mpona bilei mosusu ya Asie: ya Corée, ya Thaïlande, ya Inde, mpe ya Japon."" (San Francisco is also one of the most beautiful places in the country for other Asian foods: Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese.)

* **C: Ba hotels mpe bisika ya mayangani ezali mingi:** This is true, as the text states ""San Francisco asala bisika ya kitoko mingi mpona bapaya bayaka kotala bamboka; basala bahotel, malewa mpe bisika ya kitoko makasi."" (San Francisco has created many beautiful places for tourists to visit; they have built hotels, and beautiful places.)

* **D: Nkita etie motema mobimba na tourisme:** This is likely false. While tourism is important to San Francisco's economy, the passage mentions other major industries: ""Misala oyo ezalaka na bato mingi mpenza ezali misala ya makasi, guvernema, nkita, mombongo, mpe kokenda kotala bamboka ya bapaya."" (The jobs that are most abundant are manual labor, government, finance, commerce, and tourism.) The text implies a *diverse* economy, not one *completely* dependent on tourism.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, mosali mobembo nini akoki kozwa matomba te soki asaleli misala ya agent ya mobembo?","Réponse correcte: **B: Mosali mobembo oyo azali na momeseno ya kosala makambo na mbalakaka**

Explication:

*   **P** elobi ete kompani ya mobembo ekoki kobomba esika soki osengeli na ntango mpona kokanisa likabo to mpona kozwa mikanda (lokola visa). Oyo elimboli ete A na C bakoki kozwa matomba.
*   **P** elobi ete mbala mingi, bakompani ya mobembo eyokanaka na bahôtel ya sikisiki. Soki mosali mobembo alingaka kosala réservation ya boyokani (D), akoki kozwa matomba ya biloko oyo kompani ya mobembo ekokaki koyokana.
*   Kasi, soki mosali mobembo aza na momeseno ya kosala makambo na mbalakaka (B), boye akoki kolinga te esala reservation liboso pe apesa ye ntango ya kokanisa. Akoki mpe kolinga te kosala plan na ye ya mobembo na liboso. Akoki kobunga matomba ya likoki ya kosala reservation na nzela ya agent ya mobembo."
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobelami te na mokapo lokola litomba ya kosala réservation na nzela ya agent ya mobembo?","The correct answer is **A: Mikanda ya mobembo oyo esalemi nokinoki**.

Here's why:

*   **B: Boyokani ya hotel (Hotel agreements):** The passage explicitly mentions that travel companies often have agreements with specific hotels.
*   **C: Kofuta biloko nionso (Package deals):** The passage states that the fees often include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even flight and hotel costs.
*   **D: Kosimba réservation (Holding a reservation):** The passage says that a travel company can hold a reservation if you need time to think about an offer or get travel documents (like a visa).

The passage does not mention that travel agents provide faster travel documents, so **A** is the correct answer."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ezali na makoki te ya baprograme ya kobongola makomi na tango ya solo?","The correct answer is **D: Kobongola malamu 100% ya tango (Perfect 100% translation in real-time)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that machine translation is not perfect, saying ""...ebongalaka na ndenge ya mwa malamu (pe mbala mingi te buzoba), kasi esengeli kokeba, po ekoki kobongola makambo nyonso na ndenge ya mabe mpenza"" which translates to ""...it translates relatively well (but often not nonsensically), but caution is needed because it can translate everything badly.""

*   The other options (A, B, and C) are all mentioned as capabilities of translation apps in the passage."
Nini epesaka nzela na kobongola mabongoli na nzela ya Internet te?,"The correct answer is **C: Kozwa bansango ya lokota**.

The passage states: ""Google Translate... esalisaka na kobongola makambo ata oza te na internet nsima ya **kozwa basango nyonso ya lokota olingi**."" This means downloading the language data beforehand is what allows offline translation.
"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali te likambo oyo ebimisaka ba avalanches?","The passage states that ""Neige oyo ekangamaka"" (A), ""bato"" (B), and ""kongenga ya moyi"" (C) can cause avalanches.

The passage does not specifically mention that ""Neige oyo ebakisami"" (D) causes avalanches, although it does say ""neige mosusu ezalaki kokwea"" (some other snow was falling).

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Neige oyo ebakisami**.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi kati na oyo elandi ekiti lokola ba avalanches?","The correct answer is **C: Motango ya neige oyo eleki na mabwaku ya kotelema makasi (Motango ya neige oyo eleki na bisika ya kotelema makasi)**.

Here's why:

* **P** explains that avalanches happen when too much snow accumulates on steep slopes.  The phrase ""Motango ya neige oyo eleki na mabwaku ya kotelema makasi"" directly reflects this over-accumulation.
* **A, B, and D** don't directly relate to the concept of too much snow or steep slopes, which are the key components of an avalanche.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate description of what causes avalanches based on the provided passage.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, eloko ya malamu esalemi zingazinga ya biloko nini?","The best answer is **B: Matiti mpe biloko ya nsolo kitoko**

Here's why:

*   The text defines curry as being made with spices and flavorings (""matiti mpe biloko ekomisaka bilei kitoko""). This is the core element consistently mentioned in the description.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   A: Yogurt and Water (""Yaourt na mayi""): While yogurt is mentioned as an ingredient in some curries, water is only described as classifying ""dry"" or ""wet"" curries, so this isn't central to what makes a curry a curry.

*   C: Coconut Milk and Meat (""Miliki ya mbila mpe misuni""): While coconut milk and meat are included, they are not the central part of the curry.

*   D: Vegetables and Milk (""Bandunda mpe miliki""): Vegetables and milk are only a partial aspect of the curries."
"Na bituka mosusu, basalelaka ntango mosusu miliki ya mbila na esika ya eloko nini oyo basalaka na curry?","The correct answer is **C: Yaourt**.

The passage states that in northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries, while in southern India and coastal regions, coconut milk is often used. Therefore, coconut milk is used in place of yogurt in some regions.
"
Mpo na nini esengeli bopengwi ezala zingazinga ya bangomba Transantarctique mpo na komata na plateau?,"The correct answer is **C: Batraktere ya bomoko mpenza ezalaka makasi te**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Oyo eninganaka mpenza te yango wana nzela esengeli ekende kobaluka mosika na bangomba ya Transantarcti mpona kokoma na plateau."" This directly translates to: ""That which moves very little, that is why the road must go around the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plateau.""  This implies the tractors' lack of mobility necessitates a less steep and more circuitous route.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Mbala mingi, Gare McMurdo ekangamaka (Often, McMurdo Station is frozen):** While McMurdo Station is in a frozen environment, this doesn't directly explain the *need* for a detour around the mountains.
* **B: Neige oyo ekangami ezali likama (Frozen snow is dangerous):** While frozen snow poses challenges, it doesn't inherently explain *why* the route needs to be so roundabout. Tractors are designed to navigate such conditions.
* **D: Ezali pete koleka kosala mobembo na nzela ya Mbu Ross (It is easier to travel by way of the Ross Sea):** The passage focuses on a *land route* specifically. Additionally, the need for a detour around the mountains is related to reaching the *plateau*, not simply easier overall travel.
"
"Na nzela ya Traverse ya Pôle Sud, nini ezali na bilembo ya ba drapeaux?","Based on the provided text, the best answer is **C: Ba crevasses etondi na neige**.

The passage states: ""Eza neige ya kokangama eza na madusu mpe eza na babendele"" which translates to ""It's compacted snow with holes and crevasses."" Therefore, the South Pole Traverse route is characterized by snow-filled crevasses.
"
Nini elobelami te na mokapo lokola likambo oyo ba touristes basengeli koyeba ntango bazali kotala Afrique ya Sud?,"The correct answer is **C: Pene na mikili nyonso oyo ezali pembenipembeni ya Afrique ya Sud ezali stable** (Nearly all countries bordering South Africa are stable).

The passage explicitly states that while South Africa is relatively stable, the surrounding countries are not necessarily so (""atako Afrika ya sudi eza malamu kasi bamboka nyonso ya zingazinga eza bongo te""). Therefore, the opposite - that neighboring countries are stable - is NOT something the passage implies tourists should know. The other options are directly supported by the text.
"
"Kolandana na bokomi, nini ekotalelama lokola toli ya mabe mpo na ba touristes oyo bazali koluka kotala Afrique ya Sud na motuka?","The correct answer is **B: Atako esengeli kokende na 4x4, bisika mingi ekoki kokende na motuka ya momesano**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** While a well-maintained car is okay, a 4x4 is much better, and some places are only accessible with 4x4 tires. This contradicts option B, which implies a regular car is sufficient for most places. The passage suggests the opposite is true - 4x4 is *better* and *required* for some areas.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Biloko mosusu ya mbalakaka na kati ya motuka ekoki kosengama na mobeko** (Some emergency equipment in the car may be required by law) - This aligns with the passage, which says each country has its own rules about emergency equipment.
*   **C: Kosala mobembo na motuka ezali malamu mingi mpo na baoyo bazali koluka kopengwa na banzela oyo bato mingi basalelaka** (Traveling by car is great for those who want to get off the beaten path) - This agrees with the passage's opening statement.
*   **D: Mikili nyonso te oyo ezali pembenipembeni ya Afrika ya Sudi ezali malamu mpo na kokende kotala** (Not all countries bordering South Africa are safe to visit) - This is also in agreement with the passage's warning about the safety of neighboring countries compared to South Africa.

Therefore, option B is the *worst* advice based on the provided text.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi elobelami te na mokapo yango lokola likama oyo ekoki kobima ya kotika basaki na yo kozanga ete bátalela yo?","The correct answer is **C: Bakokaki kobulunganisama na oyo ya moto mosusu** (They could be confused with someone else's).

The passage mentions:

*   **A: Bakoki koyiba yango** (They could be stolen)
*   **B: Okoki kokóma moto oyo amemaka bangi kozanga ete oyeba** (You could become someone who carries drugs without knowing it)
*   **D: Bakonzi bakoki kotalela bango lokola likama oyo ekoki kobwaka bombe** (Authorities may view them as a potential bomb threat)

It does NOT mention the possibility of the bags being confused with someone else's.
"
Nini elobelami te na mokapo na oyo etali komema bangi?,"The correct answer is **A: Na ba pays mosusu, bato oyo basali mabe mpo na mbala ya liboso bakokaki kozwa etumbu ya liwa.**

Here's why:

* **P** explicitly states: ""...ata soki osali mpenza na mbala ya liboso; bitumba yango eza boloko ya bambula koleka 10 to liwa."" (Even if it's your first offense, the consequences are prison for more than 10 years or death). Therefore, A is supported by the passage, and therefore is NOT the answer to the question ""Nini elobelami te na mokapo na oyo etali komema bangi?"" (What is NOT mentioned in the text regarding transporting drugs?)

* **B** is mentioned - the whole passage warns about being careful while traveling.

* **C** is mentioned: ""Bakoki kosalela bambwa oyo balukaki bilangwiseli ntango nyonso kozanga koyebisa liboso."" (They can use drug-sniffing dogs at any time without prior notice.)

* **D** is mentioned: ""Bakonzi bakoki kobotola basaki na yo, ata soki ozali komema bangi te"" which is not explicitly written, but is implied. The text suggests authorities could take your bag under the suspicion it contains a bomb.
"
Lolenge nini ya masanga elobelami te lokola eloko ya komeka kosala na ndako ntango ozali na congé?,"The correct answer is **C: Masanga**.

The passage suggests trying ""jus to biloko basangisa"" (juice or mixtures) when you feel like socializing. It also mentions ""masanga ya pete"" (light drinks) that you can make at home in the morning. Coffee and tea are mentioned specifically as things to enjoy at home. Therefore, the only option *not* explicitly mentioned as something to try making at home is **masanga** (alcoholic drinks).
"
"Na oyo elandi, oyo wapi osengeli kokende kotala na ntango ya kofanda soki engumba na yo eyebani mpo na mimeseno na yango ya komela masanga?","The best answer is **C: Bisika ya komela masanga wapi okendeke mbala mingi te.**

The paragraph explicitly suggests that if you live in a city known for its drinking culture, you should go to bars or pubs you don't usually visit. This directly addresses the prompt's question about where to go when a city is known for its drinking habits.
"
Mayemi ya bibenga ezali wapi?,"The correct answer is **B: Na lopango ya lingomba**.

The text says ""Na nkunda, eza na mayemi ya kitoko ya marbre ya bapizio likolo ya nkunda mosusu,"" which translates to ""In the graveyard, there are beautiful marble baptism fonts on some graves.""  Since ""nkunda"" means graveyard, and graveyards are often part of church grounds, ""lopango ya lingomba"" (churchyard) is the most logical answer.
"
Lolenge nini ya visa ekoki kosɛnga moto apesa bilembeteli oyo emonisi ete mbongo ekoki?,"The correct answer is **D: Viza ya mwana-kelasi**.

The passage specifically states: ""Mpona mikili mingi, okozala na mposa ya mokanda ya koluka bana-kelasi ya esika oyo olingi kokende kotanga, elongo na bilembeteli ya lisungi ya mbongo mpona kokokisa bamposa na yo na mbula ya liboso ya mateya."" This directly links the need for proof of financial support to student visas.
"
Nani azali na likoki mingi ya kosɛnga visa oyo ebakisami?,"The correct answer is **C: étudiant moko ya mikili mosusu (a foreign student)**.

The passage clearly states that student visas have different requirements and processes than tourist or business visas. The passage also explains the additional requirements for student visas, such as needing an acceptance letter from a school and proof of financial support.  Therefore, a foreign student is most likely to need a more extensive visa process.
"
Ntango nini osengeli kotya likebi mingimingi na ngungi?,"The correct answer is **A: Na ntango ya sanza ya moi makasi**.

The passage states that mingimingi na eleko ya molunge (specifically in the hot season) you need to be careful of mosquitoes.  Therefore, the answer that reflects ""hot season"" is the most accurate.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, osengeli koboya kosala nini mpo na kokima ngungi ntango ozali kotambwisa motuka na zamba ya mbula?","The correct answer is **A: Kotika baporte ya motuka polele ntango molai mingi** (Leaving the car doors open for too long).

The passage specifically mentions that even a few seconds with the car door open is enough time for mosquitoes to enter the car. Therefore, avoiding this action is crucial to preventing mosquito bites. The other options are not specifically addressed in the passage or are less directly related to avoiding mosquitoes entering the car.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na ba affirmation oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali ya solo te.","Réponse oyo ezali solo te ezali **D: Ezali ndako ya ba mboloko ya ba tache, mpe baleki ba tigre ya Bengale na ebele.**

Ata nde A ezali lisusu lisusu, kasi D eza pete koloba.

Ndako ya ba mboloko ya ba tache mpe baleki ba tigre ya Bengale na ebele. Oyo ezali ya solo te, pona que na kati ya makomi, elobami ete ezali pene ya 30 000 ya bambuli mpe 400 ya ba tigre, yango wana bambuli eza ebele mingi koleka ba tigre.
"
Eteni nini ya zamba ezali na kati ya teritware ya Inde?,"The correct answer is **A: Sundarbans National Park**.

The passage states: ""Eteni ya zamba na teritware ya Inde babengaka yango parke national Sundarbans."" (The portion of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.)
"
"Kolandana na bokomi, nani azali na likoki mingi ya kozala na bososoli ata moke ya monoko ya anglais?","The correct answer is **B: Bato oyo bazali bilenge na mbula**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Bikolo mingi balobaka malamu Anglais, mpe na bikolo mosusu bato mingi bayebaka yango mwa ndambu - mingi bilenge"" which directly indicates that younger people are more likely to have some knowledge of English.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: Bato oyo balobaka ata minoko mosusu mibale:** While multilingualism *can* be correlated with a greater likelihood of knowing English, the passage doesn't directly suggest this.
*   **C: Bato oyo bazali kosala mobembo na Toronto:** Being a traveler to Toronto doesn't automatically imply English proficiency. They might rely on other languages or translation.
*   **D: Bato oyo bakómi mikóló na mbula:** The passage specifically states that younger people are more likely to have some knowledge of English, making this the opposite of what's suggested."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekoki kozala mpasi mpo na kobenga yango?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Baadresi** (Addresses).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""...mbala mingi ezalaka pete ya kokanga ntina ya maloba oyo bakoma koleka oyo balobi. Eza solo mingimingi po ya ba adrese, oyo mbala mingi ezalaka mpasi na koloba yango malamu."" (It is often easier to understand written words than spoken ones. This is especially true for addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce correctly.)

While the other options might present some difficulty, the passage directly highlights the challenges associated with pronouncing addresses. Therefore, B is the most accurate answer based on the provided information.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, eteni nini ekozala malamu mpo na mobembo oyo azali kokana kozwa mutuka uta na esika ememaka ya kati na district?","Let's analyze each option based on the provided text:

*   **A: Moto oyo azali kosala mobembo azali kokende na Jakar mpe asilá kosomba tike liboso** - The text mentions buses to Jakar/Bumthang leave between 6:30 and 7:30, and it is a good idea to buy tickets in advance for buses going to districts as they are usually full. This option is possible, so this could be correct.

*   **B: Moto oyo azali kosala mobembo azali kokende na Bumthang mpe asengeli kolongwa na ngonga ya 7** - The text says buses to Jakar/Bumthang leave between 6:30 and 7:30. Aiming to leave around 7 would be reasonable. This option is possible, so this could be correct.

*   **C: Moto oyo azali kosala mobembo azali kokende na Paro mpe asengeli kolongwa nsima ya ngonga ya 11** - The text mentions shared taxis to Paro are a quick and convenient option. The text states that the babisi elongate to various locations all day. This option is not probable since the traveller can easily go to Paro in a taxi.

*   **D: Moto oyo azali kosala mobembo azali kokende na est mpe akómi na gare liboso ya ngonga ya 6:20** - The text says buses going east leave between 6:30 and 7:30. Arriving before 6:20 would ensure they don't miss the bus. This option is possible, so this could be correct.

All the answers are possible, but the question asks for the answer that is the ""best"". The question also asks what will be appropriate for the traveller. Based on that information, it is necessary that the traveller buys the ticket in advance as the buses are usually full.

Therefore, the best answer is:
**A: Moto oyo azali kosala mobembo azali kokende na Jakar mpe asilá kosomba tike liboso**"
Nini ekozala toli malamu mpo na touriste oyo azali koluka kosala mobembo na est longwa na esika ememaka ya kati na district?,"The correct answer is **B: Somba tike ya liboso (Buy tickets in advance)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Mbala mingi, babisi oyo ekendaka na bituka ezalaka ya kotonda, yango wana ezalaka malamu kosomba tike mwa mikolo liboso."" (Often, buses going to the districts are crowded, so it's a good idea to buy tickets a few days in advance.)

The other options are incorrect based on the passage:

*   **A: Mituka elongwaka kaka nsima ya 8:30 (Buses only depart after 8:30)** - This is incorrect. The passage says buses to the east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
*   **C: Mitukas mingi elongwaka mokolo mobimba (Many buses depart all day)** - The passage states that buses *start* departing all day.
*   **D: Taxi oyo bakabolaka ekoki kozala nzela ya mayele koleka mpo na kosala mobembo (Shared taxis may be the smarter way to travel)** - While shared taxis are mentioned, they are suggested for *nearby* locations like Paro and Punakha, not necessarily for traveling to the east. The primary concern for traveling to the districts is bus crowding."

"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali solo?","The correct answer is **A: Bato bakoki kokota na engumba yango na mpepɔ** (People can access the city by airplane).

The passage explicitly states: ""Timbuktu eza engumba ya bobola mpenza, atako lokumu na yango ebendaka bato mingi na koya kotala yango, mpe eza na aeroport."" (Timbuktu is a very poor city, although its reputation attracts many people to visit, and it has an airport.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ezali exotiques koleka pauvre (It is more exotic than poor)** - The passage states ""Timbuktu eza engumba ya bobola mpenza"" (Timbuktu is a very poor city), indicating that poverty is a significant aspect of the city.
*   **C: Ezali na mayele ya Afrika mingi te koleka bingumba oyo ezali zingazinga (It has less African wisdom than the surrounding cities)** - The passage mentions ""aza na mayele migi ya baarabe kasi ya bato ya Afrika te"" (it has mostly Arab wisdom and not that of Africans) meaning that there is less African influence in the city compared to other cities.
*   **D: Engumba yango ebendaka lisusu ba touristes te (The city no longer attracts tourists)** - The passage explicitly says that its reputation ""ebendaka bato mingi na koya kotala yango"" (attracts many people to visit it), meaning tourists."
Ntango nini masano ya jeux olympiques ya été esengelaki kosalema na ebandeli? ,"The correct answer is **D: sanza ya nsambo 2020**.

The passage states: ""suka ya sanza ya misato, mayele migi ya ko annuler makambo basali mpona coronavirisi ekosuka te na sanza ya nsambo 2020, dati oyo bakanaki kosala Jeux olympiques.""  This translates to ""end of March, special cancellation policies for coronavirus won't extend beyond July 2020, the date they planned to hold the Olympic Games.""
"
"Kolandana na bokomi, na ntango nini entonnoir ekómaka mopepe makasi?","The correct answer is **D: Nsima ya kosimba mabele**

The passage states: ""Ebandaka neti ba entonnoirs oyo ezokita uta na mipepe eza na mapata, pe ekomaka """"mipepe makasi"""" ntango ekomaka na mabele."" This clearly indicates the funnel becomes a tornado (mipepe makasi) when it touches the ground (ekomaka na mabele).
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi ezali ezaleli ya sikisiki ya mopepe makasi?","The correct answer is **B: Mbala mingi, batambolaka na biloko ya kilo** (Often, they carry heavy objects).

Here's why:

*   **A: Bazali ntango nyonso kobimisa mipepe pene na 100-200 miles na ngonga moko** (They always produce winds close to 100-200 miles per hour): The text says ""mbala mingi 100-200 miles/ngonga"" (often 100-200 miles/hour), not always.

*   **B: Mbala mingi, batambolaka na biloko ya kilo** (Often, they carry heavy objects): The text states that tornadoes can ""kotombola biloko ya minene likolo, komema yango ndenge mai ya mpela esalaka"" (lift heavy objects, carry them like floodwater does).

*   **C: Ekomaka ba entonnoir nsima ya kosimba mabele** (They become funnels after touching the ground): The text says ""Ebandaka neti ba entonnoirs oyo ezokita uta na mipepe eza na mapata, pe ekomaka """"mipepe makasi"""" ntango ekomaka na mabele."" (They start as funnels descending from storm clouds, and become ""tornadoes"" when they touch the ground). So, they are funnels *before* touching the ground.

*   **D: Ezali makonzí oyo ezali kobalusabalusa oyo etindika mopepe na libándá** (They are spinning columns that push air outwards): The text says tornadoes ""ebendaka mopepe ya zingazinga na kati mpe na libanda"" (draw surrounding air inwards and outwards). While there is outwards air movement, the primary description involves drawing air *inwards* towards the low-pressure center. The best choice is still B."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, epai wapi moto oyo azali kosala mobembo asengeli kozwa toli mpo na makambo ya politiki na engumba oyo azali kokende?","The correct answer is **D: Ewuti na gouvernement na bango moko**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically warns against relying on the travel advisories of other countries, as they are tailored to their own citizens.
*   While the passage doesn't explicitly recommend getting advice from one's own government, it implies it by warning against other sources. It is the most reliable source of information for one's own citizens.
*   The other options are explicitly dismissed or implied to be unreliable in the passage."
"Soki toli ya mobembo ezwi, nini mwana mboka ya mboka mopaya akoki kokutana na yango te?","The correct answer is **D: Bansango oyo epesami na sikisiki na ntina makambo ya politiki ya ekolo** (Detailed and specific information about the political situation of the country).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Makanisi oyo balobelaka ezalaka mbala mingi ya likololikolo, ya bongobongo, pe ya mozindo te soki okokanisi yango na basango ya mozindo oyo eza na bisika mosusu."" This translates to ""The opinions expressed are often superficial, general, and not deep compared to in-depth information found elsewhere.""  Therefore, a foreign citizen relying solely on travel advisories would **not** have access to detailed and specific political information.

Let's analyze why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Bolongoli ya assurance oyo epesaki makambo mabe (Cancellation of insurance that gave false information):** While this *could* happen if someone misrepresented their situation, it's not the primary risk described in the passage. The passage focuses on the *limitations* of travel advisories, not deliberate fraud.
*   **B: Bokusi oyo ezalaki nan se mingi nan tina na makambo ya politiki ya ekolo (Intense politicization):** The passage doesn't discuss politicization.
*   **C: Assurance maladi oyo ebebisamaki (Health insurance that is damaged):** The passage mentions that travel can compromise your health insurance, so someone could experience this."

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na likambo nini moto oyo azali kosala mobembo akozwa matomba mingi soki asalisi mosali ya mobembo?","The correct answer is **B: Ntango mobembo azali na posa ya kosala réservation ya excursion spécialisée mpo nampo na mbala ya liboso**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Kompani ya mobembo ezalaka mbala mingi liponi ya malamu mpona mobembo oyo ekosenga kotala makambo koleka oyo moto azosala mobembo amona na bozalisi, bokoko, lokota to mikili ya bobola."" (Travel agencies are often a good choice for travel that involves more than the traveler typically sees in nature, culture, language, or countries.)
*   **Option B directly aligns with this:** A specialized excursion requires expertise and knowledge beyond what a typical traveler might have. The passage implies that travel agencies excel at handling these complex trips.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: Ntango mobembo azali kosala réservation ya ba vols ya kokende mpe kozonga mpo na kotala mboka na bango:** Booking basic round-trip flights is relatively straightforward and can often be done easily online without the need for a travel agent.
*   **C: Ntango mobembo ayebi malamu monɔkɔ ya mboka ya esika oyo azali kokende congé:** Knowing the language makes travel easier and reduces the need for assistance.
*   **D: Ntango mobembo azali kokende kotala esika oyo bokeseni ya mimeseno eyebani na bango:** Even though cultural differences exist, the passage highlights a travel agency's expertise is more helpful when exploring places outside of someone's personal view of culture, language, or environment.

Therefore, the best answer is **B**."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ekoki kosalisa moto oyo azali kosala mobembo azanga mawa ntango azali kotala bisika ya sika?","The correct answer is **B: Kolinga komeka bilei oyo oyebi te**.

Here's why:

* **The Passage's Main Point:** The passage emphasizes that things will be different when you travel and that you need to be open-minded to avoid frustration and resentment. It encourages acceptance of the differences in culture, customs, and daily life.
* **Why B is Correct:** Option B, ""Kolinga komeka bilei oyo oyebi te"" (Being willing to try foods you don't know), directly aligns with the passage's advice to accept differences. Trying new foods demonstrates openness and willingness to experience a different culture, which helps avoid disappointment and resentment.
* **Why the Other Options are Incorrect:**
    * **A: Kozela mibeko ya ndenge moko lokola esika oyo bauti** (Expecting the same rules as where they come from): This is the *opposite* of what the passage advises. Expecting things to be the same is a recipe for frustration.
    * **C: Kokangama na mibeko ndenge moko na esika bawuti** (Adhering to the same rules as where they come from): Similar to A, this contradicts the passage's core message about accepting different customs.
    * **D: Koboya bolukiluki ya liboso mpo na esika ya kolala** (Refusing prior research on the place of accommodation): The passage never mentions anything about accommodation research.

Therefore, the best answer is **B**.
"
"Na kotalela makambo oyo ezali na mokapo yango, moto ya ndenge nini akoki kozala na mawa ntango azali kokende na esika mosusu?","The correct answer is **C: Moto oyo azali na makanisi ya kokangama** (Someone with fixed ideas/a rigid mindset).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes adapting to differences.** It warns against expecting things to be the same as ""home.""
* **Someone with fixed ideas is *resistant* to change and different ways of doing things.** They'd likely be frustrated by the differences in customs, laws, food, etc., mentioned in the passage, leading to unhappiness or even resentment.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Moto oyo alingaka bilei ya exotiques (Someone who likes exotic food):** This person would likely enjoy trying new foods and wouldn't be unhappy about different cuisines.
* **B: Moto oyo azali kokola malamu na mbongwana (Someone who thrives on change):** This person would be excited by the differences and wouldn't be unhappy.
* **D: Moto oyo asepelaka koyekola (Someone who likes to learn):** This person would be curious and engaged by the new experiences and wouldn't likely be unhappy.

Therefore, only someone with a rigid mindset (fixed ideas) would be likely to experience regret or unhappiness due to the differences described in the passage.

"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali toli oyo ebongi te mpo na bato oyo bazali kosala mibembo mpo na mbala ya liboso na mboka oyo ezali naino na bozwi mingi te?","Réponse correcte est **B: Boya kolekisa mbongo mingi na bilei na boumeli ya mwa mikolo na yo ya liboso**.

Explication:

Le texte donne les conseils suivants:

*   Se familiariser avec les différences culturelles.
*   Utiliser des hôtels de luxe au début pour s'adapter.
*   Ne pas dormir à même le sol dans des endroits inconnus.
*   Utiliser un lit de camp ou un hamac si on campe.

Le conseil de ""kolekisa mbongo mingi na bilei"" (dépenser beaucoup d'argent en nourriture) n'est pas donné dans le texte. Au contraire, il suggère d'utiliser des hôtels avec des services déjà inclus pour faciliter l'adaptation, mais ne recommande pas de dépenser beaucoup en nourriture spécifiquement.

Les autres options sont basées sur les conseils donnés dans le texte.

"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi elobelami te lokola likambo ya kolekisa ndelo ntango ozali komesana na mboka oyo ezali naino na bozwi mingi te?","The correct answer is **C: Matela to pad mpo na kosala camp**.

Here's why:

*   The passage recommends bringing a camping bed or hammock to *avoid* sleeping on the ground. It doesn't mention sleeping on a matela or pad as being excessive.
*   The passage recommends taking advantage of nice hotels with good food and services to adjust. This implies A, B, and D could be considered excessive if relied on too heavily and prevent one from experiencing the culture."
"Na ba options oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekozala malamu mpo nampo na mobateli ya police oyo alingi kopi oyo ebetami ten a papye ya politiki na ye, kasi akoki kosalela internet te?","Réponse exacte: **A: Kopesa kopi moko na moninga na ye ya mobembo**

Explication:

* **A:** Soki mobateli ya police azali na moninga ya mobembo, apesaka bango kopi ya makomi. Moninga akoki kopesa kopi yango soki esengeli, ata soki mobateli ya police azali na internet te.
* **B:** Komitindela bango moko kopi na nzela ya email esengi internet, oyo mobateli ya police aza na yango te.

Yango wana, option oyo eleki malamu mpo na mobateli ya police oyo aza na internet te ezali **A: Kopesa kopi moko na moninga na ye ya mobembo.**
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi kati na makambo oyo elandi esengeli te kolakisa na politiki?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **D: Addresse email ya mobateli ya polisi**.

The passage does not mention showing the email address of the policy provider to police. It emphasizes having these details for consultation, approvals, and claiming.

Here's why the other options are more related to the passage:

*   **A: Mitango ya telephone ya mokili mobimba mpo na kosenga bafuta** - The passage states: ""Basengeli kolakisa adrese e-mail pe nimero ya telefone ya mikili mingi mpona kozwa toli/ndingisa pe kosenga oyo balingi."" This translates to showing phone numbers for consultation/approvals and claims.
*   **B: Addresse email ya motu ya assurance** - Similar to the above, the email address of the insurer is directly mentioned as necessary.
*   **C: Mitango ya telephone ya mokili mobimba mpo na ndingisa** - As stated above, the passage emphasizes having these details for consultation, approvals, and claiming, including phone numbers."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, bonene nini ya mabe ezali komonisa lolenge ya filme oyo basalelaka mingi?","The correct answer is **C: 35 mm ya négatif**.

The passage states: ""Oyo basalelaka mingi eza filme 35 mm (36 na 24 mm na nsima) emonanaka mingi."" This clearly indicates that 35mm film is the most common format.
"
"Na lolenge ya film oyo elandi, oyo wapi epesaka komonana oyo ekokani na DSLR?","The correct answer is **A: Film ya 35 mm**.

The passage explicitly states that 35mm film is ""similar to modern DSLR formats.""
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na kati na yango, oyo wapi ekozala litambe ya nsuka mpo na kobanda mombongo ya kokoma mibembo?","The passage states that after you are skilled in web formatting and editing, then you can create your own website. Therefore, building your own website is the final step.

So the correct answer is: **C: Tongela site na yo moko**
"
"Ntango obandi mombongo ya kokoma mibembo, makoki nini na oyo elandi esengeli mbala mosusu kobongisama liboso?","The answer is **A: Kosala bablog**.

Here's why:

* **The premise (P) states:** The easiest way to get started in writing work is to develop your skills by blogging on established websites.
* **The question (Q) asks:** When starting a travel writing business, which skill should be improved first?

The premise suggests that blogging is the best way to develop your writing skills initially. Therefore, ""kosala bablog"" (blogging) is the skill that should be focused on first in the context of starting a travel writing business, according to the given information.

Na lolenge nini ya klima mikakatano ya misɔpɔ ezwamaka mingi?,"The passage clearly states: ""Ndenge ezalaka mpona makambo ya pema na bisika ya malili mingi, maladi ya misompona bisika ya molunge ezalaka mwa mingi"". This indicates that stomach problems are more common in hot climates.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Baklimat ya molunge**
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, kozala mbala na mbala ekoki komema na immunité ya nini?","The correct answer is **A: Mikakatano ya misopo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that regularly eating local foods *at home* likely means you won't get sick. It then contrasts this with traveling and eating foods in other parts of the world where your body is not used to the local microbes. The passage specifically mentions ""maladi ya libumu ya Delhi, elakeli mabe ya Farao, kozongisa mabe ya Montezuma"" which are all different names for digestive issues (traveler's diarrhea). Therefore, repeated exposure (kozala mbala na mbala) to *local* microbes leads to immunity to *intestinal problems*.

Let's look at why the other options are wrong:

*   **B: Mikrobe ya mboka**: While exposure to local microbes builds immunity, the question is about the *result* of that exposure, not the microbes themselves.
*   **C: Mikakatano ya mpema**: The passage mentions respiratory problems in cold climates as a comparison to stomach issues in hot climates, but it doesn't link repeated exposure to local foods with immunity to respiratory problems.
*   **D: Delhi Belly**: Delhi Belly is *an example* of a possible outcome of lack of immunity, not what you develop immunity *to* with repeated exposure."
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali litomba ya kosala mobembo na kati ya zone ya Schengen?","The correct answer is **C: Koboya bisika mingi ya kotala passeport** (Avoiding many passport check points).

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""...mbala mingi okoki kokatisa bangambo kozanga batala passeport na yo lisusu na bisika batalaka yango,"" which translates to ""often you can cross borders without your passport being checked again where they check it.""
*   The text also mention: ""Soki oza na viza ya Schengen, oza na ntina te ya kosenga viza ya ekolo nyonso mosusu oyo eza mosangani ya Schengen; ekosalisa yo na kobomba ngonga, mbongo pe mikanda."" This refers to not needing to apply for multiple visas, which is linked to saving time, money and documents. So, **A** and **B** are also correct.
*   The final part of the quotation mentions that the Schengen visa saves time, money and document. This refers to the time and money needed for several visa applications. This makes **A** and **B** correct as well.

Therefore, the best answer is:

*   **A: Koboya ba demandes ya visa ebele**
*   **B: Kobomba mbongo**
*   **C: Koboya bisika mingi ya kotala passeport**

Because the question only expects a single answer and *Koboya bisika mingi ya kotala passeport* is a direct and obvious implication of traveling within the Schengen zone.
"
Nini ekoki kozwama lisusu te na lilita ya Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **D: Bomengo (Wealth)**.

The passage states ""Bozwi ya mingi ya nkuda wana eza lisusu te na kati na yango, kasi balongola yango pe bamema yango na musée ya Egypte na Caire."" which translates to ""Most of the wealth of that tomb is no longer inside, but it has been removed and taken to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.""

The passage mentions that you'd only be able to see ""moto na mapeka"" (shoulders of the mummy), but it does not specifically say that they are missing or have been removed. The wealth, however, is explicitly stated as being removed to the museum.

"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, esika nini ya Vancouver ekosepelisa mingi te mpo na bato oyo bazali kosala mibembo oyo batalelaka ntalo ya biloko? ","The correct answer is **D: Whistler**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that ""Whistler... is expensive"". The question asks which location is least interesting for cost-conscious travelers."
"Nakotala makomi oyo elekiKolandana na bokomi, esika nini ekoki kopesa bato oyo bazali kosala mibembo likambo ya solosolo ya Vancouver?","The correct answer is **A: Esanga ya Bowen**.

The passage explicitly states that Bowen Island is a great place to visit near Vancouver and offers various activities. While Granville Island is mentioned as a place to catch the ferry to Bowen Island, Bowen Island itself is presented as the destination. Whistler is further away and doesn't provide the immediate Vancouver experience.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, ntango nini bato oyo basalaka mibembo basengeli kokende kotala Chutes soki bazali koluka bisika oyo ezali kopekisa bango te?","The correct answer is **D: Na libanda ya eleko ya mbula**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that during the rainy season (November to March), the falls are very powerful, and you'll get soaked. It also mentions that the spray makes it difficult to see the falls properly.
*   Therefore, to avoid these conditions, travelers should visit outside of the rainy season. ""Na libanda ya eleko ya mbula"" (outside of the rainy season) is the most logical and accurate answer."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ezali malamu mpo na kotala Chutes Victoria kati na sanza ya zomi na moko mpe sanza ya misato?","The correct answer is **D: Koboya eleko ya mbula** (Avoiding the rainy season).

The passage states: ""Na eleko ya mbula (sanza ya zomi na moko kino na sanza ya misato), mai ezalaka mingi mpe balobwaku ekozala makasi. Okozanga te kopola soki okatisi gbagba otamboli na banzela oyo ezala pene ya lobwaku wana. Na ndambo mosusu, eza mpenza po mai ezalaka likolo mingi yango wana okoki komona te malamu Balobwaku—mpona mai nyonso wana!""

This clearly indicates that during the rainy season (November to March), the falls are very powerful, you'll get soaked, and visibility is poor. Therefore, it's *not* a good time to visit. So the best thing to do is to *avoid* the rainy season.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, oyo wapi kati na makambo oyo elandi esɛngami te ntango ozali kosalela drone mpo na kokanga ba film?","The correct answer is **D: Ko filmer kaka na ba endroits ebele esika drone ekozala remarquable te**.

Here's why:

* **A: Kotala liboso nini ozali na ndingisa ya ko filmer:** The text explicitly states this: ""Soki ozosalela drone, luka koyeba liboso nini bakopesa yo nzela ya kokanga foto..."" (If you use a drone, find out first what you are allowed to photograph).

* **B: Kozwa ndingisa mosusu:**  The text mentions that you might need other permissions: ""...mpe bandingisa nini mosusu okozala na mposa na yango."" (...and what other permissions you will need).

* **C: Kosala bolukiluki na mikanda ya ndingisa:** This is implied by needing to know what you are allowed to film and what permissions you need.  You'd have to research the regulations.

* **D: Ko filmer kaka na ba endroits ebele esika drone ekozala remarquable te:** The text does *not* say to only film in places where the drone won't be noticed. It advises against flying near airports or over people, but that's for safety and legality, not to avoid attention.
"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, bisika wapi ezali malamu koleka mpo na kokanga ba film na kosaleláká drone?","The best answer is **D: Na bisika oyo ozuaki ba permis ya liboso** (In places where you have obtained prior permits).

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes the importance of checking permissions before flying a drone for photography or videography. Therefore, filming in locations where you have secured the necessary permits is the most aligned choice.

Let's consider the other options:

*   **A: Pene na ebele ya bato oyo bakotungisama te na présence ya drone** (Near a large number of people who would not be disturbed by the presence of a drone): While avoiding disturbing people is good, the passage focuses on legal compliance first.
*   **B: Na bisika oyo bapesaka nzela te na kokanga ba foto mbala na mbala** (In places where photography is not frequently allowed): This is the opposite of what the passage advises.
*   **C: Na bisika oyo bato balekaka mingi, mpe drone emonanaka mingi te** (In places where there are many people passing by, and the drone is not very visible): The passage specifically says flying over people is a bad idea."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, bisika wapi ezali malamu koleka mpo na kokanga ba film na kosaleláká drone?","The correct answer is **D: Na bisika mosusu, ba hotels ya mboka ekoki kosala mosala ya kokomisa nkombo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Na bamboka mingi oyo eza na mobeko wana, bahotel na bango bakipaka mosala ya kokomisa nkombo (kobosana te kotuna).""  This translates to ""In many countries that have this law, their hotels take care of the registration process (don't forget to ask).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Soki ozali kofanda na bisika ya kolala ya batouristes, ekoki kozala ete osengeli te kokomisa nkombo:** The passage says ""Kasi, yango ezokomisa mobeko mabe koleka, yango wana luka koyeba liboso."" Which means ""But, that makes the law worse, so look to find out beforehand."". So A is false.
*   **B: Bikólo nyonso esɛngaka kokomisa nkombo na bakonzi ya mboka:** The passage only mentions that ""Na mikili mosusu, okoki kokomisa nkombo na yo na adrese ya esika okofanda epai ya bakonzi ya mboka."" which means ""In other countries, you can register your name at the address where you live with the local authorities."" This doesn't mean it's required in *every* country.
*   **C: Ekoki kosenga kokende kotala babiro oyo etalelaka makambo ya bato oyo bautá na mikili mosusu:** The passage mentions ""kokende na biro ya immigration"" which means ""go to the immigration office."". This might be necessary in *some* cases.

"
"Na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ezali esika oyo touriste akoki kokende te mpo na kosala mosala ya kokomisa nkombo na bango?","The correct answer is **C: Poste moko ya mboka**.

The passage mentions:

*   Polisi ya mboka (police office)
*   Hotel
*   Biro ya immigration (immigration office)

It doesn't mention the post office as a place for registration.

The passage states, ""...misala mingi ya bolingo malamu epesaka esika ya kolala mpe bilei mpe moko epesaka mwa salere."" This directly supports option C. While the passage mentions a small salary, option C is more generally applicable based on the text.

"Nakotala makomi oyo elekiKolandana na bokomi, nini ekoki kotalelama lokola atypique ya mobembo ya moyenne na Walt Disney World?","The passage describes the ""typical"" Walt Disney World trip as involving staying at a Disney hotel and not leaving the Disney property. Therefore, staying at a hotel outside the Disney property would be atypical.

So the answer is **B: Kofanda na hôtel moko oyo ezali libanda ya esika yango**
"
Na ba affirmations oyo elandi ya Walt Disney World oyo wapi ezali ya solo te?,"The correct answer is **A: Batike ya park-hopper ekoki kopesama na ba voyageur misusu**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Atako eza mosala oyo esalemaka mingi, epekisami na Disney: okoki te kopesa batike na moto mosusu."" (Even though it's a common practice, it is forbidden by Disney: you cannot give tickets to someone else.) This means any ticket, including a park-hopper ticket, cannot be transferred.
*   B, C, and D are all implied to be true in the passage:
    *   B: ""kokende na hotel Disney na bisi"" (going to a Disney hotel by bus) - indicates lodging exists.
    *   C: ""kokende na hotel Disney na bisi"" (going to a Disney hotel by bus) - indicates buses are available from the airport.
    *   D: ""Batike ebele oyo batekaka na internet na nzela ya basite internet eBay to Craigslist eza batike ya mikolo ebele oyo basalela mwa moke."" (Many tickets sold online through eBay or Craigslist are multi-day tickets that have been partially used.) - confirms multi-day tickets are found on auction sites."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na makambo oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kolobelama mingi te na kelasi ya formation professionnelle to na mikanda?","Based on the passage, here's the breakdown and why the answer is likely correct:

*   **The passage:** Focuses on the need for specialized training for individuals going to conflict zones, emphasizing the lack of readily available resources (books, training) specifically addressing war zone realities. It mentions researching online for resources.

*   **Options Analysis:**

    *   **A: Kobika na esobe (Wilderness Survival):** The passage explicitly states that books on wilderness survival are *more* common than those on conflict zones (""Babuku na bazulunalu oyo elobelaka kofanda na zamba ezalaka mingi...""). Therefore, this is *less* likely to be unmentioned in training or books.

    *   **B: Komibongisa mpo na lisalisi ya liboso (Preparing for first aid):** First aid is a crucial skill in various situations, including conflict zones. So it's likely to be covered in professional training.

    *   **C: Kozala prêt ya zone ya bitumba (Being Ready for war zone):** The initial statement and the overall context of the passage revolve around the special requirements to be ready for war zone.

    *   **D: Ko jouer role (Role-playing):** Role-playing, in the context of training, refers to simulating real-world scenarios to prepare individuals for specific situations. This includes practicing communication, decision-making, and problem-solving. This is a valuable method for conflict zones training.

*   **Conclusion:**

Considering the passage, **C: Kozala prêt ya zone ya bitumba (Being Ready for war zone)** would be the least covered in professional training or general literature. The passage highlights the scarcity of resources specifically focused on war zone preparation. So the option **C** would be the right answer.

**Therefore, the answer is C.**"
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, na mateya oyo elandi, oyo wapi ekoki kozwama mingi na kelasi ya formation professionnelle?","Based on the paragraph P, which emphasizes the need for training before going to conflict zones, and mentions the difficulty in finding resources specifically about war zones compared to wilderness survival, the best answer is:

**B: Bisika ya bitumba**

Here's why:

*   **P** explicitly states the importance of training for conflict zones (""Moto nyonso oyo azokana kokende na mboka oyo bato balobaka eza esika ya bitumba asengeli kozwa formation ya malamu."")
*   While first aid (A) and wilderness survival (C) are valuable skills, the passage focuses on the *specific* challenges of war zones.
*   ""Bisika ya banguna"" (D) is too general. ""Bisika ya bitumba"" directly addresses the topic of conflict areas, and it is the most logical topic for formation based on the text."
"Nakotala makomi oyo eleki, nini ezali nzela ya malamu koleka mpo na kokima mai oyo ekoki kozala na mikrobe?","The best answer is **B: Somba mayi ya milangi**. Here's why:

*   **P says:** ""soki oza na motungisi, osengeli kosomba mai na molangi ya kokanga euti na kompani moko ya malamu."" (If you are worried, you should buy bottled water from a good company).

The passage indicates that if you're truly concerned about contamination, buying bottled water from a reputable company is the safest option. Other methods may be adequate in some situations, but bottled water is presented as the most reliable way to avoid potentially contaminated water."
Kobeta mai penepene na ba récifs?,"Based on the provided text, the best answer is **C: Kobeta mayi na sens mosusu (Swim in a different direction)**.

Here's why:

* **The problem:** The text describes rip currents, where strong currents pull swimmers away from the shore. The text explicitly states that people drown because they try to swim directly against the current back to shore, exhausting themselves.
* **The solution implied in the text:** The text suggests that if you are caught in a rip current, you should first get out of the current before trying to swim back to shore. It says, ""Soki obimi na esika oyo mai eza makasi, ezala mpasi te na kobeta mai mpona kozonga."" (""If you get out of the area where the water is strong, it will be easier to swim back."") The best way to get out of a rip current is to swim parallel to the shore.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kobeta mayi penepene na ba récifs (Swim near reefs):** The text doesn't mention reefs.
* **B: Kobeta mayi kati na mayi ya mozindo (Swim in deep water):** Swimming in deep water would likely worsen the situation.
* **D: Kobeta mayi na mayi zingazinga ya mbonge (Swim in the water surrounding the waves):** This doesn't directly address escaping the rip current.

Osengeli kosala nini soki okangami na mbonge?,"The correct answer is **A: Meka kobima na mbonge na koluka na ngambo mosusu, nsima beta mayi lisusu na libongo** (Try to get out of the wave by searching on the other side, then swim back to shore).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: **""Soki obimi na esika oyo mai eza makasi, ezala mpasi te na kobeta mai mpona kozonga.""** (If you get out of the area where the water is strong, it will be easy to swim back). This implies swimming *out* of the current before swimming back *towards* the shore.
*   The passage also suggests **""Meka koluka esika oyo bakokanga yango lisusu te...""** (Try to find a place where you won't be caught again...). This means moving *laterally* to escape the rip current.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Beta mayi mbangu koleka na sens mususu** (Swim faster in the other direction). This is vague and doesn't specify *which* other direction. Swimming directly against the current is discouraged in the passage as it leads to exhaustion.
*   **C: Beta mayi na ngambo mosusu** (Swim in the other direction). Same reason as B.
*   **D: Beta mayo na nse ya mayi** (Swim underwater). The passage does not suggest this as a strategy, and it could be dangerous to hold your breath in a turbulent situation."
