"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iliphi icedo elingafanele lokudlala i-accordion ngendlela ephumelelayo?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuze unyuse ivolumu, cindezela kakhulu indlela odlala ngayo**.

The passage specifically states that you *don't* need to press keys with great force to get a louder sound on an instrument that isn't a piano.  It mentions that for an accordion, using greater bellow strength and speed is the correct way to increase volume.
"
"Njengoba udlala i-accordion, ikuphi okungasiza ukuze unyuse ivolumu?","The correct answer is **A: Ijubane elengeziwe**.

The passage states, ""Ukuze uthole umsindo owengeziwe, ensimbini yomculo ingositini, usebenzisa lokhu okungezansi okunamandla kanye nejubane eliphezulu."" This clearly indicates that increased volume on the accordion is achieved through both power (amandla) and speed (ijubane). The passage specifies 'ijubane eliphezulu', so the best answer is A.
"
Kungani izithombe ezivela ku-thelevishini zincishiswa emaceleni?,"The correct answer is **B: Manje izithombe zicwgala isikrini sonke**.

The passage clearly states that the reason for overscan (the cropping of images) is to ensure that the image covers the entire screen of the television.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iziphi izikinga ezilandelayo omunye okungenzeka ehlangabezane nazo uma eshintsha imuvi ayise kusimo se-DVD?","The correct answer is **C: Isithombe esigcwala isikrini sonke**.

The passage explains that the problem is the image being *too large*, resulting in parts of it being cut off due to overscan. This means the image is filling the entire screen and *more*, not less.
"

"Kulezi zindawo ezilandelayo, iDunlap broadsides ifikele kuphi kugcina?","The correct answer is **C: eLondon**.

The passage states: ""Ikhophi yafika eLondon ngo-Agasti 10..."" meaning one of the Dunlap broadsides ended up in London. The passage also states that ""... Ukuhlasela ngamazwi okungu-25 kwe-Dunlap okwaziwa ukuthi kukhona amakhophi wedokhumenti akhona amadala kunawo wonke"" meaning that those 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest known existing copies.
"
Amabutho kaColonel Stark bekakuphi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ekupheleni kwenyakatho, ocingweni**.

The passage states: ""Abantu bakaStark baya endaweni esocingweni olusenyakatho kwendawo yabenzi bamaKoloni.""
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ayingezelele nini ucingo amadoda kaStark?","The correct answer is **C: Ngesikhathi sokukhathala okuncani**.

The passage states: ""Uma ukuncipha kwamanzi kuvula isikhala ngaseMfuleni iMistiki ngasempumalanga nyakatho yenhlonhlo, banweba ngokushesha uthango ngodonga olumfishane lwamatshe ngasenyakatho oluphelela ngasekuqaleni kwamanzi ogwini oluncane.""

This directly indicates that Stark's men extended the fence during low tide (ukuncipha kwamanzi).
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, isiphi isikhathi lapho iChina beyinobudlova kakhulu?","The correct answer is **D: Izikhathi Zombuso Ezinthathu**.

The passage states: ""IMibuso Emithathu kwakungenye yenkathi yegazi eliningi kunazo zonke emlandweni waseShayina yakuDala...""
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iliphi iqiniso lamabutho izintuthwane ezingena esikhathini senomadic?","The correct answer is **B: Umtapho wokudla kwabo kuncani**.

The passage states that the colony enters the nomadic phase when the available food supply is depleted.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, imuphi umusho uqondile ohambisana nalokho okwenzeka esidlekeni amabutho wezinthuthwane phakathi nesikhathi nenomadic?","The correct answer is **C: Bashintsha izidleke nsuku zonke.**

The passage states: ""Phakathi nalesi sigaba, ikoloni lenza izidleke zesikhashana ezishintshwa zinsuku zonke.""  This directly supports option C. The other options are either contradicted or not mentioned in the passage.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuzoqubeka nakuba kukhona okungezelele kwezimpawu?,"The correct answer is **A: Umkhiqizo okujikeleza ngaphakathi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""endogenous oscillators will continue to operate on a free-running cycle even in a temporal vacuum"". Endogenous oscillators are responsible for internal cycling production.

Let's look at why the other options are not as strong:

*   **B: Izikhathi ezithile kwezigqi**: While rhythms are timed, the *presence* of time cues isn't what sustains the internal cycle itself. The *internal* oscillator does.

*   **C: Izikhathi zezinto eziphilayo**: This is too broad. While biological organisms exhibit rhythms, the passage focuses on the internal mechanisms driving them.

*   **D: Izigqi ezibhekiwe**: This is about behavior that is observed. However, if there are no external signals, this behavior is more complicated to predict."
Yimuphi umusho ochaza okuveza okuhlukahlukene kwesici se-phenotypic?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphic**.

The text explains that when individuals show several different variations of a particular trait, they are polymorphic.
"
Yikuphi okulandelayo okunembile okuchaza izinto eziphilayo endaweni ethile?,"The correct answer is **B: Inani labantu**.

Here's why:

*   **Population** (Inani labantu) is defined as a group of organisms of the same species living in a particular area. This directly aligns with the definition given in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Monomorphic** (i-Monomorphic) and **Polymorphic** (i-Polymorphic) describe the *variation* within a population, not the population itself.
*   **Species** (Izinhlobo zezinto eziphilayo) is a broader classification. A population is a group within a species that lives in a specific area."
Yikuphi okulandelayo okungeke kube isibonelo sendawo ezokuvakasha esingokwemvelo?,"Impendulo efanele ngu- **C: Ukuvakashela i-mnyuziyami yesayensi**.

Nasi isizathu:

*   Inkcazelo yezokuvakasha ezingokwemvelo igxile ekuvakashisheni ezindaweni zemvelo futhi uthole indlela zokuphila. Imisebenzi ihlobene ngqo nokujabulela izici zemvelo nezilwane zasendle.
*   Ukugibela intaba ukuze sithole impophoma, ukuthwebula izimbali zasendle, kanye nokudoba izinhlanzi konke kuhambisana nalokhu kuchazwa ngoba kuhilela ukuba sezindaweni zemvelo futhi uhlanganyele nemvelo.
*   I-mnyuziyami yesayensi yisakhiwo esenziwe umuntu esingafaneleki ngaphakathi kwencazelo yezokuvakasha ezingokwemvelo."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okuyisisekelo kwezokuthutha?","The passage states: ""Kuloluhlobo lwesithuthi olunamandla wonke umuntu ngandlelathile uxhumene, futhi usekela uhlelo lokuthutha olusekelwe ezimotweni ezincane.""

This directly points to the transportation system being based on **private vehicles**.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Izimoto ezizimele**.
"
Izinxeyana ezizungeza i-nucleus zinakuphi ukugcwaliswa?,"The correct answer is **C: i-Negative charge**.

The passage states that ""Ama elekthroni anamandla kagesi angaphansi kweqanda ngenani"" which translates to ""Electrons have a negative electrical charge"".
"
I-Necleus yenziwe ngezinxenye ziphi?,"The correct answer is **A: ama-Protons nama-neutrons**.

The passage states: ""I-nucleus yenziwe ngezinhlayiyana ezimbili - ama-neutron kanye nama-proton.""
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okuyisibonelo se-five bit binary number?","The correct answer is **C: 10010**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** A binary number uses only 0s and 1s.
*   **A five-bit binary number:** Must have five digits.

Looking at the options:

*   **A: 1010** - Only has four digits
*   **B: 12001** - Includes the digit '2', which is not binary.
*   **C: 10010** - Has five digits, and all digits are either 0 or 1.
*   **D: 110101** - Has six digits

Therefore, only option C fits the description of a five-bit binary number."
Ingabe amadijithi aneziqu ezimbili kubuye kubhekiselwe kuwo ngokuthini?,"Impendulo efanele ngu **A: ama-bit**.

"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungekho emushweni okuyisisekelo okuzuzisa abafundi ekutholeni ulwazi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuncipha ehlukunyezweni otanga** (Decrease in peer harassment).

Here's why:

* **A: Ukuthuthuka emthethweni yelimi nekhona lokubhala** (Improvement in language rules and writing ability): The passage explicitly states that blogging helps students improve their writing.
* **C: Ukuqaphela okukhulu kulokho okukuzungezile** (Greater awareness of what surrounds you): The passage states that blogging ""forces students to be more perceptive about the world around them.""
* **D: Isithakazelo esikhulisiwe sokuqubeka ufunda** (Increased interest in continuing to read): The passage states blogging ""encourages students to not just learn on a standard school day.""

* **B: Ukuncipha ehlukunyezweni otanga** (Decrease in peer harassment): This is *not* mentioned in the passage. The passage focuses on the academic and intellectual benefits of blogging, and does not mention bullying at all."
Yikuphi okulandelayo abafundi bangathola khona ulwazi lokubakhuthaza ukuba bathuthukise ikhono labo lokubhala?,"The passage mentions the following reasons why blogging helps students improve their writing:

*   The presence of an audience often changes a student's casual writing style.
*   Students want to avoid criticism from their peers.
*   The need to maintain the interest of the audience motivates students to be more thoughtful and engaging.

Therefore, the best answer is **C: Ukugcina isithakazelo ezilalelini zakho (Maintaining interest in your audience)** and **B: Isidingo esinamandla sokubalekela ukuxekwa (The strong need to avoid criticism)**, because these directly relate to the reasons for improvement given in the text.

Options A and D relate to other benefits of blogging, but not specifically to improvement in writing ability.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungazuzisi ku-asynchronous communication kwabafundi? ,"Impendulo efanele ngu **B: Ukufinyelela abafundisi ubuso nobuso noma kunini osukwini**.

Incazelo:

Ukukhulumisana okungenzeki ngasikhathi sinye kusho ukuthi akwenzeki ngesikhathi esifanayo. Ngenxa yalokho, akukwazi ukufinyelela abafundisi ubuso nobuso noma kunini osukwini ngoba akuyona indlela yokukhulumisana ngesikhathi esifanayo. Izinketho ezisele zonke ziyizinzuzo zokuxhumana okungenzeki ngasikhathi sinye njengoba zivumela ukuguquguquka, ukucabanga, nokulawulwa kwesikhathi.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo kwe-asynchronous communication okungakhululekile kwabafundi?","The passage explicitly states that asynchronous communication gives students control over the *pace of learning* and allows for *flexible working hours*. It also mentions the use of the internet.  The passage doesn't mention any rules of materials, therefore the answer is **C: Umthetho wezinto zokusebenza**.
"
Yini engavezwanga kulesi sigaba omunye angaze akuhlobanise nezinqaba zakudala?,"The correct answer is **D: Amasosha asendulo agibela amahhashi**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Amatilongwe angumgodi** - The passage specifically mentions ""ukwesaba okuphuma ematilongweni angumgodi"" (the fear emanating from dungeon prisons).
*   **B: Imiqhudelwano yokulwa ngemikhonto phezu kwamahhashi** - The passage mentions ""imiqhudelwano yokulwa ngemikhonto phezu kwamahhashi"" (jousting tournaments on horseback).
*   **C: Imithetho yamaqhawe** - The passage mentions ""imithetho yamaqhawe yenkathi ka-Arthur"" (chivalric codes of the Arthurian era).

The passage only mentions that jousting tournaments are performed on horseback, and does not make a general statement about ancient soldiers being horsemen. Therefore the answer is D."
Ikuphi okungashiwongo lapha kulesi sigaba okuvela njengomnuko noma umsindo ongaqamuka noma ikuphi kulamarubhi wenqaba?,"The correct answer is **C: Idili**.

The passage mentions tournaments, jousting, sounds and smells of battles, clanging of shackles, and the scent of fear. A ""idili"" (banquet) doesn't fit into this imagery of warfare, imprisonment, and decay. The other options all describe experiences connected to the building or the happenings surrounding the place of a fort.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuchaza ngokunembile i-Kirby Muxloe Castle?,"The correct answer is **B: Kudingenkile ukuqiniswa okuncani ngenxa yokuthula kwezwe okungokwemvelo ngesikhathi kwakhiwa**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""...ezweni belinokuthula kakhudlwana futhi ukuzivikela bekudingeka emaviyweni amancane kuphela wabaphangi."" This directly supports the idea that less fortification was needed due to the peaceful state of the country during its construction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ubukhulu bezindonga zenqaba bezicelwe Nkosi uHastings** The passage does not mention anything about the size of the walls being ordered by Lord Hastings.
*   **C: Ukwakhiwa kwenqaba bekungakajwayeleki ngokwaleso sikhathi** The passage describes the castle being a ""strong house rather than a true castle,"" because of the less intense fortification measures, and window size/walls.
*   **D: Yakhiwa ngendlela yokuthi ikwazi ukubekezela ukuhlaselwa** The passage directly contradicts this, saying the windows and walls ""zingeke zikwazi ukumelana nokuhlaselwa kwangempela isikhathi eside."""
Yikuphi ukwakhiwa okujwayelekile kwezici okulandelayo ebekungagcatshwangelwa kwenqaba yeKirby Muxloe Castle okuchazwe lapha kulesi sigaba kwangaleso sikhathi?,"The passage states that Kirby Muxloe Castle had large glass windows and thin walls that would not withstand a real attack for long. It also mentions that defenses were only needed against small bands of raiders. This implies reduced fortifications compared to other castles.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Amafasitela amakhulu:** The passage explicitly mentions large windows as a feature that wouldn't be good for defense.
*   **B: Isisekelo esakhiwe ngendlela ekungakwazi ukubezela ukuhlaselwa:** The passage implies that the castle could not withstand a real attack for long, meaning its foundation/structure was not built in a way to withstand an attack.
*   **C: Ukuqiniswa okuncishisiwe kunamanye amanqama:** The passage directly suggests reduced fortifications.
*   **D: Izidonga ezincani:** The passage explicitly mentions thin walls.

The best answer is **B: Isisekelo esakhiwe ngendlela ekungakwazi ukubezela ukuhlaselwa** as the others are explicitly stated as weaknesses.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okuvezwe lapha okuzozuzisa umgijimi ukuze alungiselele isizini ezayo?","The correct answer is **D: Ukusebenzisa i-gym ukuze uvocavoce okhalweni kuyaphezulu** (Using the gym to train the upper body).

Here's why:

*   The paragraph explicitly mentions ""ukuzivivinya kokuqinisa imisipha namathambo engxenye engaphezulu yomzimba"" (exercises to strengthen muscles and bones of the upper body) as good preparation for the running season. This directly translates to upper body training in a gym.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuphrakthiza ukugijima i-cross country ngehlobo** (Practicing cross country running in the summer) The paragraph refers to cross-country running in winter, not summer.
*   **B: Xila kakhulu ekubambeni ijubane njengoba ulungiselela umdlalo** (Focus intensely on maintaining speed as you prepare for the game) While speed is important, the passage emphasizes that endurance becomes more important than speed for the half-mile.
*   **C: Ukuhlula imizuzu emithathu yesikhathi** (Beating a time of three minutes) - The passage mentions breaking two minutes for a top-level half-mile runner, not three. And it doesn't suggest it as part of the season preparation."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okubaluleke kakhulu ngomgijimi oyi-first-class half-mile runner?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuhlakulela ukubekezela kune jubane (Cultivating endurance over speed)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...ngoshintsho kusuka engxenyeni yesine kuye engxenyeni yokusubatha kwemayela, isivinini siba esingabalulekile kangako futhi ukukhuthazela kuba isidingo ngokuphelele... kodwa ukukhuthazela kumelwe kuhlakulelwe nakanjani (with the shift from a quarter to a half mile run, speed becomes less important and endurance becomes an absolute necessity...but endurance must be cultivated).**"" This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ukuphrakthiza ukugijima i-cross country ngesikhathi sezinyanga zasebusika (Practicing cross country running during the winter months)**: While the passage mentions running cross country, it presents it as *one* form of preparation. It doesn't say it's *the most* important thing for a first-class half-mile runner.
*   **C: Ukuqeda ngaphambi kwemizuzu emibili (Finishing before two minutes)**: The passage states that a first-class half-mile runner *should* be able to run in under two minutes, but it's not the *most important* thing. Speed matters, but endurance matters more.
*   **D: Ukuhlakulela ijubane kunokubekezela (Cultivating speed over endurance)**: This is the opposite of what the passage emphasizes. The passage explicitly says endurance is more important."
"Ngokuya komsubathi, ikuphi okulandelayo okungeke kwenzeka ngokuthi adle ukudla okunempilo kuphela?","Ngokwalokho okushiwo, ukudla okunomsoco kukodwa angeke kukwenze umdlali enze kahle kakhulu.

Ngakho-ke impendulo efanele ngu:

**C: Ukusebenza okusezingeni eliphezulu**

Incazelo: Nakuba ukudla okunomsoco kunomthelela enjabulweni, impilo enhle, kanye nokuthuthukisa indlela umuntu adlala ngayo, kodwa akwanele ukwenza umdlali afinyelele ezingeni eliphezulu lokusebenza. Kudingeka nezinye izinto ezifana nokulinganisela amandla, ukunakekela uketshezi emzimbeni, nokuqonda amaphilisi amandla.
"
"Ngokuya kwalesi sigaba, ikuphi okulandelayo okungavunyelwe ekutheni abadlali abasebasha bathole injabulo kuzemidlalo?","The correct answer is **B: Ukungashintshi ekudlaleni ezingeni eliphezulu** (Failure to improve performance).

The passage states that good nutrition, hydration, and understanding energy supplements can *help* athletes improve performance and enjoy sports more. Therefore, the *opposite* of improving performance (ukungashintshi ekudlaleni ezingeni eliphezulu) would hinder their enjoyment. The other options are things the passage indicates would *promote* enjoyment.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kungani umgijimi webanga elide angathenga ucezu lwemishini olubizayo?","The best answer is **A: Into ethandwa umuntu siqu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that runners may like a product even if it has no real benefits. This implies that personal preference (what someone likes) can be a reason to buy something, even if it's not performance-enhancing.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   B: Kufakazelwa ukuthi inezinzuzo: The passage implies the opposite. It says many products have little to no impact on performance.
*   C: Izothinta kakhulu indlela abesebenza ngayo: The passage contradicts this, stating most products have little to no impact on performance.
*   D: Kunemibono eyiphutha ngemishini engabizi kakhulu: While the passage does mention misconceptions, it's about *expensive* gear and the misconception that you *need* it, not about why someone would buy it."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini edingakayo kumgijimi ogijima ibanga elide?","The correct answer is **C: Imishini encishisiwe** (Reduced equipment).

The passage states that middle-distance running is not expensive and that many products have little to no impact on performance. This implies that a runner needs very little specialized equipment.
"
Ubani owathola i-nuclear magnetic resonance? ,"The correct answer is **C: uBloch noPurcell**.

The passage states: ""I-MRI isuselwa esenzakalweni sesayensi esibizwa nge-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), eyatholwa ngawo-1930 ngu-Felix Bloch (owayesebenza eNyuvesi yase-Stanford) kanye no-Edward Purcell (waseNyuvesi yase-Havard).""
"
Kwakumuphi umnyaka lapho i-patent yokuqala yavunyelwa ukwenza i- medical imaging resonance? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The passage states: ""Iminyaka emine kamuva incwadi yemvume yanikezwa, okwakuyincwadi yemvume yokuqala emhlabeni enikezwe enkundleni yeMRI."" This refers back to the previous sentence about Raymond Damadian's discovery in 1970. Four years after 1970 is 1974.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini abantu okumelwe bayiqonde ukuze bakwazi ukuchaza izenzo zabanye?","The correct answer is **B: Inhloso**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Phakathi kwalawa makhono, ukuqonda inhloso yabanye kubalulekile. Kusivumela ukuxazilula izindida ezingaba khona zezenzo ezingokoqobo."" (Among these abilities, understanding the intention of others is important. It allows us to resolve the potential ambiguities of concrete actions.)
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ukuqonda i-intention kuzosiza abantu ukuba benze ini?","The best answer is **A: Susa ukungaqiniseki ekwenzeni izinto**.

The passage explicitly states that understanding intent allows us to ""ukuxazilula izindida ezingaba khona zezenzo ezingokoqobo"" which translates to ""resolve potential puzzles of real actions"". This aligns with removing uncertainty.

Here's why the other options aren't as good:

*   **B: Bikezela izifiso:** While the passage mentions predicting what others desire, the focus of understanding intent is on clarifying actions, not solely predicting desires.
*   **C: Bheka abanye ngaphandle kokubahlulela:** The example given implies that understanding intent is key to giving people the proper judgement they deserve.
*   **D: Funda iziqgondo zabanye:** Although understanding intention is a key component in understanding what goes on in other people's minds, the passage does not say that understanding intention means one will be able to read another's mind.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okunembile ngenhloso enkulu ka-AI?","The passage states that robotics research involves making machines automate tasks that require human intelligence. It then lists examples such as control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer inquiries, and recognizing handwriting, speech, and faces.

While options A, B, and C (scheduling, voice recognition, and planning) are mentioned as examples of AI applications, the broader goal is to automate tasks requiring human intelligence. Option D, ""Self-regulating operation"" (or ""Self-operating task"" if the translation is more accurate), best encompasses this overall purpose. It speaks to the core objective of AI, which is to create systems that can perform tasks autonomously.

Therefore, the best answer is **D: Umsebenzi ozihlelayo (Self-regulating operation or Self-operating task)**.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, esikhathini esinengi ikuphi okulandelayo okuhlotshaniswa ne-AI?","The correct answer is **D: Ubona lokho okubhalwe ngesandla**.

The passage mentions ""ukuqaphela ngesandla, izwi nobuso"" as an example of what AI research in robotics involves. This directly relates to option D. While AI can be used in areas related to options A and B, option D is explicitly mentioned in the text. Option C is incorrect because the passage highlights AI's importance in computer science and real-world applications.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okuyinxenye enamandla kumuntu ohlezi anemicabango yokuhlangana?","Impendulo efanele ngu **D: Ukukhumbula amaphethini.**

"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okungeke kucatshangelwa kumuntu oneqgondo ethanda ukuhlanganisa abantu?","Impendulo efanele **B: Ukuthatha isikhathi sakho**.

Isizathu:

Isiqephu sigqamisa izinto ezilandelayo mayelana nendlela yokucabanga ehlelwe kahle:

*   **Isivinini, ingqondo kanye nokunemba:** Lokhu kusho ukuthi ukuthatha isikhathi eside akuhambisani nalolu hlobo lokucabanga.
*   **Kunempendulo eyodwa kuphela enembile:** Lolu lwazi luqondana ngqo nenketho A.
*   **Ukuphawulwa kwamaqiniso, ukuqongelela ukwaziswa:** Lokhu kusho ukuthi ukubona amaqiniso nokubuthelela imininingwane (izinketho C no-D) kuyizinto ezibalulekile.

Ngakho-ke, inketho B iyona engahambisani nendlela yokucabanga echazwe esiqeshini.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okungeke kucatshangelwe njenge-micro-expression?","The correct answer is **D: Ukunikeza imvume ngesithupha**.

Here's why:

*   **Micro-expressions** are defined in the passage as subtle, fleeting facial movements that last only fractions of a second. The passage also mentions facial movements.

Let's examine each option:

*   **A: Ukushalazela amehlo njengoba ukukhuluma:** This is a facial movement.
*   **B: Ukusika ishiya:** This is a facial movement.
*   **C: Ukucwayiza kaningana:** This is a facial movement.
*   **D: Ukunikeza imvume ngesithupha:** This is a gesture involving the hand, not a facial movement.

Therefore, giving a thumbs up is not a micro-expression."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuchaziwe okungelona iqiniso nge-micro-expression?,"The statement that is NOT true based on the provided paragraph is:

*   **D: Kungakusiza uhlolisise uzwela**

Here's why:

*   **A: Ukuqopha kwamavidiyo kwenze izinto ezibalulekile zathuthukiswa** - This is true; the passage directly states that video recording has led to important advances in interpreting micro-expressions.
*   **B: Ukumusha okuqondile kungathola amanga** - This is true; the passage states that it's claimed one can detect lies by accurately reading micro-expressions.
*   **C: Inkulumo kuhlanganise nesimo sobuso kuyahumushwa** - This is true; the passage mention those who have diffuculty in understanding speech are able to interpet truth
*   **D: Kungakusiza uhlolisise uzwela** - While micro-expressions *could* relate to understanding emotions (and thus empathy), the passage doesn't explicitly state this. The focus is on detecting deception and understanding behavior, not specifically increasing empathy or investigating sensitivity."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okwaba okubalulekile okwaholela ekutheni kuvuselela izinto? ,"Impendulo efanele yi **C: Ukukhumbula umlayezo**

Ikuphi okulandelayo okungakhuthazi ukusebenzisa i-inthanethi ukuze uqubeke nokuthandana?,"The passage mentions ""personal participation"" and ""ongoing relationship"" as motivations for using the internet. It also mentions ""socializing"" as an important motivation.

Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: Ezimayelana namabhizinisi:** This is unlikely to be a motivator for dating specifically. Business is related to work and professional life.
*   **B: Ukuxhumana nomndeni njalo:** While important, this doesn't directly motivate *dating*.
*   **C: Ucwaningo lokuhamba:** This is irrelevant to dating motivations.
*   **D: Ukuhlanga nabantu abasha:** This is a direct motivation for dating.

Therefore, the option that is least likely to motivate using the internet for dating is **A: Ezimayelana namabhizinisi**.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungavezi isikhuthazo sokusebenzisa i-inthanethi ukuzibandakanyeni komuntu siqu?,"Ngokusekelwe kulokho okushiwo, ""ukuhlanganyela komuntu siqu"" kungenzeka ukuthi kuhlobene kakhulu nokuzilibazisa, ukuzithuthukisa, noma ukuthola ulwazi oluthile oluwusizo kumuntu.

*   **A: Ukubheka incwadi yokupheka:** Lokhu kungaba ngokuqondile ukuhlanganyela komuntu siqu ngoba umuntu ufuna ulwazi oluthile lokupheka okuzokwenza kube lula kuye.
*   **B: Ukufaka ku-inthanethi izinxoxo zebhodi:** Lokhu kungaba ukuhlanganyela komuntu siqu uma umuntu efuna ukuhlanganisa abanye abantu.
*   **C: Ukugcwaninga ngomkhiqizo wokunakekela impilo:** Lokhu kungaba ngokuqondile ukuhlanganyela komuntu siqu ngoba umuntu ufuna ulwazi oluthile ngempilo yakhe.

Ngakho-ke impendulo efanele **A: Ukubheka incwadi yokupheka**"
Kunini lapho intshonalanga Yurophu yayeka ukuthembela emathonyeni wokuphila yase iqala eyayo inkambo yokuphila?,"The passage states: ""Ngasekupheleni kweNkathi Ephakathi intshonalanga Yurophu yaqala ukuthuthukisa isitayela sayo.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **A: Ngasekhupheleni kwezinsuku zakudala**"
Ukusebenza izinkinobho ukubopha izimpahla kwaveza miphi imiphumela? ,"The correct answer is **D: i-Middle Ages**.

The passage states that the development of using buttons to fasten clothing occurred towards the end of the Middle Ages.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo ocatshangelwayo okungaba isombululo ezinkingeni zemvelo?","The correct answer is **C: Ubona ibangena yekinga (Seeing the root of the problem)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that while efforts like environmental campaigns and advocacy are helpful in managing symptoms, a long-term solution requires identifying and addressing the root cause of environmental problems: *""Nokho, uma singafuni isisombululo sesikhashana, kumelwe sithole umsuka wenkinga bese sinqanda wona.""* (However, if we don't want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem and prevent it.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ukunqaba ukunqumo zempilo ephezulu (Refusing high-quality living decisions):** While the passage mentions a wasteful lifestyle as a contributing factor, it doesn't suggest denying oneself a good quality of life as *the* solution.

*   **B: Ubushoshovu (Activism):** Activism is mentioned as helpful, but only as a short-term solution that addresses the symptoms.

*   **D: Ukuba umgani womnyakazo kwezinto eziphathele nezemvelo (Being a friend of the movement for environmental things):** This is similar to activism, a supportive measure. The passage identifies this as treating symptoms, not the cause."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iziphi izinto ezilandelayo ekungeke zicatshangelwe njenge zinto ezingalapha izinkinga zemvelo?","The correct answer is **B: Ukucisha imbangenla yenkinga**.

Here's why:

*   **P** argues that we need to *address the root cause* of the problem and stop it, rather than just treat the symptoms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuba yinxenye yobushoshovu** - Passage P suggests this can help reduce the suffering in the future
*   **C: Ukuveza umbono ngezinqumo zempilo ephezulu** - Passage P suggests that living without harming the environment can help reduce the suffering in the future.
*   **D: Ukuphila endaweni enobuntu** - Passage P suggests that living without harming the environment can help reduce the suffering in the future.

Therefore, only option B directly addresses the ""root cause"" of the problem, which is what the passage implies is more effective than just treating the symptoms."
Iliphi izwe lokuqala laseYurophu lapho indaba yalo yayixile ekulinganiseni kwamandla kuzenkolo?,"Ngokusekelwe kulwazi olunikeziwe, impendulo eyiyo ithi:

D: Spain

Isizathu:
Isitatimende sithi iMpi Yokulandelana Kobukhosi baseSpain yaphawula impi yokuqala leyo impikiswano yayo enkulu kwakungukulinganiselwa kwamandla. Lokhu kusho ukuthi iSpain yiyona lizwe lokuqala laseYurophu lapho indaba yalo yayixile ekulinganiseni kwamandla kuzenkolo."
Iyiphi impi kwesinye isikhathi ichawe ngokuthi impi yenkolo?,"The correct answer is **A: Impi Yeminyaka Emashumi Amathathu**.

The passage states: ""Ngakho, iMpi yeMinyaka engaMashumi amaThathu bekuzoba yimpi yokugcina ebizwa ngokuthi yimpi engokwenkolo."" This directly identifies the Thirty Years' War as the last war that was called a religious war.
"
Ikuphi olandelayo okuthile kwesonto lamaKatolica okungazange kwaxekwa?,"Based on paragraph P, the criticism leveled against the Catholic Church was centered around:

*   **Whether the Church was living up to its own doctrine of using wealth to alleviate suffering and poverty.** The paragraph explicitly mentions the disparity between the Church's wealth and its stated purpose for holding that wealth.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Ukube ukunikana kwencebo emaSontweni bekufaneleka** (Whether the giving of wealth in the Churches was appropriate)."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani owabulawa eVersailles?","The correct answer is **D: Unogada**.

The passage states that a member of the mob wanted to display the severed head of a royal guard who was killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungazange kwenziwa ngenkani eNkosini neNdlovukazi yayo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukubukela ukunqunywa kwekhanda kwakanogada**.

The passage states that a member of the crowd *wanted* to force the queen to see the severed head, but it doesn't say that they succeeded. The passage mentions the opening of the windows, the forced travel from Versailles, and the journey back to Paris.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungazange kwaba umphumela wempi ekungasetshenziswanga kwamasosha empini yaseBritain?,"The passage states that Britain's naval blockade resulted in:

*   **A: Isifiso saseGermany ukusebenzisa indlela efanayo yokulwa impi** (Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare because of the limited response to the British blockade).
*   **D: Izinto ebezidengeka kakhulu bezingatholakali lula** (The blockade removed supplies for the military and civilians).

The passage also implies that:

*   **C: Ushintsho lwenziwa emthethweni yezizwe:** Since the blockade violated international laws, it suggests a shift or potential change in those laws.

The passage explicitly states that Britain's blockade made waterways dangerous even for **ordinary ships**, not that the ships were safe to passage. Thus, option B is incorrect

So the answer is B."
Imuphi umusho ongaqinisekisiwe ochaza ukuvimbezela kwemikhumbi yezimpi yeBrithani kumaJalimani?,"The sentence that is NOT true about the British naval blockade of Germany is:

*   **D: Iqinisekise ukuthi imikhumbi engahambi ngeke ilinyazwe (Ensured that non-military ships would not be harmed)**

The passage explicitly states that the blockade caused accidents even for ordinary ships due to mines. So, D is incorrect. The other options are all supported by the passage."
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, kungafanela bani ukuhlolwa okunengi kweSclerosis?","Impendulo efanele ngu **A: Owesifazane oneminyaka eyi-32**.

Nansi incazelo:

*   Isitatimende sithi i-MS ivamile kakhulu kubantu abasha abadala nabaphakathi. Owesifazane oneminyaka engu-32 ungena kulelo banga lobudala.
*   Isitatimende siphinde sithi abesifazane banamathuba amaningi okuba ne-MS kunabesilisa.

Ezinye izinketho azivumelekile ngoba:

*   Umfana oneminyaka engu-15 nentombazane oneminyaka engu-10 baphansi kakhulu.
*   Nakuba indoda eneminyaka engu-43 ingena kulobu budala, abesifazane banamathuba amaningi."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, abahlanganyelo bomsebenzi othile badinga ukuba basekelwe kuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Umbono ongafanele ngokuzwa ubuhlungu**.

The passage states: ""Labo abazibandakanya emisebenzini evamile badinga ukusekelwa okwengeziwe mayelana nokuzwa ubuhlungu, ubona umehluko phakathi kobuhlungu obungapheli kanye nokungaphatheki kahle okuvela ekunyakazeni komzimba.""

This clearly indicates that people involved in regular activities need more support regarding their **perception of pain** (umbono ongafanele ngokuzwa ubuhlungu), specifically in differentiating chronic pain from discomfort caused by movement. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ifencing idalwa njani?","The correct answer is **D: Ngokwendlela okusebenza ngayo kuhlanganisewe**.

The passage explains how fencing is played, focusing on its fundamental mechanism of competitive weapon combat. It doesn't describe the origins or creation of fencing, but rather how it *functions* - ""omunye eshaya omunye"" (one hits the other). Therefore, describing how it works is the most accurate interpretation.
"
"Ngokuya komusho, ikuphi okulandelayo okunamdla okuveziwe okungaba yishefu yangaphakathi?","Impendulo efanele ngu **A: Ukuzizwa ngathi ungahlanza nokushiselwa**

Incazelo:

Umusho ovela ku-P uthi izimpawu *njengokuhlanza* zanele ngokuvamile ukuthi umhlahlo wokushesha angeke wenziwe. Phakathi kwezinketho ezikhona, inketho A yilena eqondane kakhulu nalesi simo (ukuzizwa ngathi ungahlanza). Nakuba ukushiselwa kungakakhulunywa ngqo, kungaba uphawu oluhambisana nokuzizwa ngathi ungahlanza okubangelwa ubuthi.

Ezinye izinketho azisiyo impendulo efanele ngoba:

*   **B:** Ukujuluka akukhulunywa ngakho umushweni.
*   **C:** Nakuba amajaqamba nobuhlungu besisu kungaba yizimpawu zobuthi, umusho ugcizelela ukuhlanza.
*   **D:** Incwadi kadokotela equkethe bodlela lamapilisi ayikhombisi ngokuqondile ukuthi kunobuthi, kodwa ingase ibe uphawu olusolisayo uma amapilisi ephenduke amaningi kakhulu."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, isiphi isinyathelo sokuqala esiqondile okumelwe usithathe ukuze uhlole isisulu?","The correct answer is **A: Beka indawo**.

The passage states the first step is to ""ukuqala uhlole indawo yesehlakalo ukuqinisekisa ukuphepha kwakho."" This translates to initially assessing the scene to ensure your own safety.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungakanembi okukhuluma ngokuthi olinyaziwe kumelwe ahlolwe njani?,"Impendulo efanele ngu: **A: Ukungakhathazeki kakhulu ngokunakekela ukulimala kwakho.**

Isizathu:

*   Isitatimende sithi kufanele uqale uqinisekise ukuphepha kwakho. Lokhu kusho ukuthi kufanele uzinakekele wena kuqala ukuze ukwazi ukusiza ohlukunyezwayo ngempumelelo. Ukungakhathazeki ngokuphepha kwakho kungaba yingozi futhi kuphambane neziqondiso ezinikezwe isitatimende.

Ezinye izinketho zifanele:

*   **B: Hlolisisa indawo ngaphambi kokubheka olinyaziwe** - Lokhu kuvumelana nokuthi kufanele uqinisekise ukuthi indawo iphephile kuqala.
*   **C: Bheka ukuthi olinyaziwe ukuphi** - Lokhu kubalulekile ngoba kufanele uthole indawo ohlukunyezwayo.

Yiluphi ishintso olwenziwa iFrench Revolution okwaba nomthelela omuhle kubantu abasebenza kahle?,"Impendulo efanele ngu **B: Ukususwe ukugxila ku-class kwayiswa ekuqedeni**

Nazi izizathu:

*   Umbuzo ubuza ngoshintsho oluzuzise abantu abasebenza kanzima (the hard-working).
*   Isigaba P sichaza ukuthi emva kweNguquko, izikhundla zazivulekele wonke amadoda afaka izicelo, okuvumela abantu abazikhandlayo ukuthi baphumelele. Lokhu kusho ukuthi ukubaluleka komndeni noma isigaba (class) sehlile, kuthandwa ukuzimisela nokusebenza kanzima.

Ezinye izinketho azihambisani kahle:

*   **A: Ukusekelwa kwesizwe okungezelelwe:** Nakuba ukwesekwa kwezwe kwakukukhulu, akukona ngqo okuzuzise abantu abasebenza kanzima ngendlela efanayo.
*   **C: Ukutholwa kwemicabango yeRepublican:** Nakuba kubalulekile, akukona ngqo ukuzuzisa abantu abasebenza kanzima ngendlela efanayo njengokuqedwa kokugxila esigabeni.

"Ukulandela iFrench Revolution, ukuphumelela kwamasosha nabanye ezengini elithile kwakusekelwe kuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuphumelela (Achievement)**.

The passage states: ""after the Revolution positions were open to all men applicants that allowed the most ambitious and go-getters to succeed."" This clearly indicates that success was based on achievement and ability, not on social status or other factors.

The passage also mentions that ""they choose to put cailaber to give soldiers ratings"" which also supports the idea that they are looking at the performance ratings and achievements of the soldiers.
"
Yimuphi umsebenzi womphakathi obangela ukuthi ungajabulisi emazweni athuthukile?,"The correct answer is **C: Ezokuthutha zomphakathi**.

The passage specifically states that people in developed countries rarely complain about water quality or failing bridges, but frequently complain about transportation systems.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kungathiwani ezokuthutha zomphakathi?","The correct answer is **C: Abanga izinkulumo ezingenig kulabo abawasebenzisa kakhulu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""Cishe wonke umuntu uyakhalaza ngohlelo lokuthutha."" This translates to ""Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.""
* The prompt asks what can be said about public transportation according to the passage, so statement C is the only logical and explicitly true statement.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zithanda kakhulu yiwo wonke umuntu ozisebenzisayo**: The passage clearly contradicts this by saying almost everyone *complains* about the system.
*   **B: Wona awekho mabi kangako ngokuya ngezinga lamanzi**: This statement compares transportation complaints to water quality complaints. While the passage mentions this comparison, it doesn't say transportation is *not that bad* compared to water quality. It only highlights the difference in complaint levels.
*   **D: Akhululekile kulamazwe asethuthuke kakhulu**: The passage doesn't mention anything about public transportation being free in developed countries. It only contrasts the level of complaints in developed countries regarding transportation versus other infrastructure.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okungaba nzima ukulinganisa ngenxa yezenso ezingakalindeleki kwabashayeli?","The correct answer is **D: Ukuhamba kwe-traffic**

The passage states: ""Ngeshwa, ukucwaninga ukuhamba kwezimoto kunzima ngoba imikhuba yabashayeli angeke ibikezelwe ngokuqiniseka okuphelele."" This directly links the difficulty in studying traffic flow to the unpredictable actions of drivers.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okusebenzayo uma uveza ukuhamba kwe-traffic ngokwezibalo?,"The passage states that modeling traffic flow mathematically helps with ""planning, designing, and operating roadway facilities."" Of the options, ""design of roadway"" most closely aligns with this.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Umklamo wendlela**.
"
Basebenzise ini uHershey noChase ukufaka iDNA? ,"The correct answer is **D: Amagciwane**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""U-Hershey noChase basebenzise ama-phages, noma amagciwane, ukuthi bafake i-DNA yabo phakathi kwebhakithiliya."" (Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria).

While radioactive phosphorus and sulfur were used to *label* the DNA and proteins, respectively, the phages (viruses) were the *vectors* used to inject the DNA.
"
Ukwazi ukushintsha kwezakhi zofuzo bese kudluliselwa kwenye into ephilayo ukuze kwenzeke kuncike kuphi?,"Impendulo efanele ithi **A: Uma amaseli angama seli wobulili**.

Isizathu: Isitatimende esithi P sicacisa ukuthi ""ukuguquka kwezakhi zofuzo emagqamuzaneni wamagciwane kuphela okungadluliselwa ezinganeni."" Amangqamuzana wamagciwane amangqamuzana esidoda neqanda. Lokhu kusho ukuthi kuphela uma ukuguquka kwezakhi zofuzo kwenzeka kulawa mangqamuzana angadluliselwa, ngakho-ke impendulo engcono kakhulu ithi A.

Ezinye izinketho azilona iqiniso ngoba:

*   **B:** Nakuba ukubaluleka kwento ethintekile yezakhi zofuzo kungaba nomthelela emiphumeleni yokuguquka kwezakhi zofuzo, ayithinti ukuthi ukuguquka kwezakhi zofuzo kungadluliselwa yini.
*   **C:** Nakuba uhlobo lokuguquka kwezakhi zofuzo lungaba nomthelela emiphumeleni, aluthinti ukuthi ukuguquka kwezakhi zofuzo kungadluliselwa yini.
*   **D:** Uma ukuguquka kwezakhi zofuzo kubanga ukufa kwamangqamuzana, lokhu akuthinti ukuthi ukuguquka kwezakhi zofuzo kungadluliselwa yini."
"Ngokuya kolwazi olunikeze yilesi sigaba, ukuhlukahlukana nemiphumela kwezakhi zofuzo azincikanga kuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Okungakani okuthintekile kwe-genetic material**

**Explanation**
The passage states that the magnitude or type of effect of a mutation depends on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are sperm or egg cells. 
The magnitude or the size of the mutation doesn't influence the variation and effect of a genetic makeup.

"
Yikuphi okulandelayo okwakungeson isizathu amasiko wasendulo agcine izimbuzi?,"Impendulo efanele yi **C: Basinikeza ubungani**.

Umbhalo ucacisa ukuthi amasiko asendulo azigcina izimbuzi ngenxa yobisi, izinwele, inyama kanye nesikhumba, hhayi ubungani.
"
Umgomo wegalofu ukuba uthathe inani elincani lani?,"The correct answer is **B: amaStokes** (strokes).

The passage states: ""Umdlali oshaya izikhathi ezincane kunabo bonke, noma ukushwiba kwesimuhluza, ukuze aqede umdlalo enkundleni uyawina."" This translates to: ""The player who hits the fewest times, or *strokes* of the club, to complete the game on the course wins.""
"
"La kudlalwa khona igalofu, utshani busikwa kuphi kancani?","The correct answer is **B: Lapho kuhlaza khona**.

The passage explicitly states: ""utshani olungasemigodini busikwa bube bufishane futhi bubizwa nge-green."" (the grass next to the holes is cut short and called the green)
"
Kwakuyini injongo yalolucgwaningo?,"The passage states that an experiment is used to:

*   Disprove one or more good hypothesis
*   Ask questions
*   Make observations
*   Guide scientific research

So the most accurate answer reflecting the purpose within the context of the passage is **D: Ukuhola ucwaningo lwesayensi** (To guide scientific research).  Although other options like C are part of the process, the ultimate goal tied to experimentation, as described, is to guide broader scientific research.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini engasizi ukuze ihole ugcwaningo lwesayensi?","The correct answer is **A: Yona yodwa indlela yesayensi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the scientific method *guides* much scientific research, but it's not the *only* thing involved.
*   It explicitly mentions experimentation, which involves eliminating preconceived notions, questioning, observing, and conducting research, as things that guide scientific research.

Therefore, relying solely on the scientific method without these other elements wouldn't be sufficient to guide scientific research."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, isiphi isitatimende esikhuluma ngesiphepho esinamdla kakhulu okungelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **C: Ezingi iziphepho ezinamandla zihlala amahora angaphezu kwemithathu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Amaphesenti amabili wezishingishane ezibucayi kakhulu athatha ngaphezu kwamahora amathathu."" This means only 2% (a very small percentage) of the most violent tornadoes last over three hours, not ""many"" or ""most"".

The other options are true based on the passage:

*   A: ""Izishingishane zigadla endaweni encane uma kuqhathaniswa nezinye iziphepho ezinamandla, kodwa zingabhubhisa yonke into esendleleni yazo.""
*   B: ""Izishingishane zigadla endaweni encane uma kuqhathaniswa nezinye iziphepho ezinamandla...""
*   D: ""Isiphepho esikhulu esingakwayelekile besigijima ngesivinini sika-480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph)."""
"Ngokuya kwalesi sigaba, yimuphi umusho oqondile ochaza iziphepho ezinamandla?","The correct answer is **D: Angakwazi ukususa izihlahla kusukela ezimpandeni zazo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Izishingishane zisiphula izihlahla..."" which translates to ""Tornadoes uproot trees...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngokujwayeleile sihlala amahora angaphezu kwamahora amathathu (We usually last for more than three hours):** The passage states that only ""amaphesenti amabili wezishingishane ezibucayi kakhulu athatha ngaphezu kwamahora amathathu (two percent of the most severe tornadoes last more than three hours)."" This is not a general characteristic.
*   **B: Zenza imimoya ezihamba ama-mile ang-480 ngehora (They make winds that travel at 480 miles per hour):** The passage does mention a specific case where a tornado reached 480 km/h (approximately 300 mph), but it doesn't state that *all* powerful tornadoes reach that speed.
*   **C: Amosha izindawo ezinkulu kunezinye izinhlekelele zemvelo (Destroy large areas than other natural disasters):** The passage specifically states, ""Izishingishane zigadla endaweni encane uma kuqhathaniswa nezinye iziphepho ezinamandla (Tornadoes strike a small area compared to other powerful storms).""

Therefore, only option D is a directly stated characteristic of tornadoes in the provided passage."
Yikuphi okulandelayo okuqala okwenziwe abantu kusukela ngokhulu lesi-16?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukwenza isibonakude**.

The passage states that ""the first *real* telescopes were made in Europe at the end of the 16th century"". Options A, B, and C were all done for thousands of years before the 16th century, as indicated by the opening sentence about magnifying glasses.
"
Kusikhathi esingakanani lapho abantu bebesebenzisa amalensi ukukhulisa izinto abazibonayo?,"Impendulo efanele ngu **A: Iminyaka eyinkulungwane**.

Isitatimende P siqonde ngqo ukuthi abantu sebenze futhi basebenzisa izingilazi ukukhulisa izinto abazibonayo izinkulungwane zeminyaka.
"
"Ngokuya kwalesi sigaba, umhume kaMuhammad uchaza kanjani izinto zakhe zomoya namsiko?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuthanda ukuthula nokuzihlukanisa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Muhammad went to the cave to meditate and that the cave provides a clear picture of his spiritual inclination.
*   The description of the cave emphasizes its isolation and lack of worldly distractions, suggesting that Muhammad sought peace and solitude for his spiritual practices.
*   C and D are accurate too but A answers the question more holistically.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, insimbi yayisetshenziselwani ekuqaleni?","The correct answer is **D: Ojantshi**.

The passage states: ""ngokuhamba kwesikhathi, nokho, kwabonakala ukuthi ujantshi ungasebenza kangcono uma ungaba nommombo wensimbi ngaphezulu."" This indicates that iron was initially used as a layer on top of the rails.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kungani amasondo wokhuni akhishwa kwafakwa wensimbi?","The correct answer is **D: Ebeqedwa insimbi endleleni** (They were being worn down by the iron rails).

The passage states that the iron rails were wearing down the wooden wheels of the wagons. This is why the wooden wheels were eventually replaced with iron wheels.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini eyakha abantu ngesikhathi seRomanticism?","The correct answer is **B: Umumo womhlaba**.

The passage states: ""Esizindeni seRomanticism, indawo ibumba abantu ngabanye..."" (In the realm of Romanticism, the land shapes individuals...)
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungavezi umbono we-technological determinism? ,"Impendulo efanele ngu **A: Umthelela wezobuchwepheshe ezinomthelalela ngayo emphakathini ziyalawuleka.**

Nazi izizathu:

*   **Inkolelo yokumiselwa okungokwezobuchwepheshe** njengoba ichazwe embhalweni isho ukuthi:

    *   Ubuchwepheshe bunomthelela obalulekile emiphakathini, yomibili ngokwezomnotho nezenhlalakahle.

A. Umbono we-Inkolelo yokumiselwa okungokwezobuchwepheshe uyaphikisana nomqondo wokuthi imithelela yezobuchwepheshe ilawuleka, ngoba i-Inkolelo yokumiselwa okungokwezobuchwepheshe iyalawuleka isho ukuthi ukuthuthuka kwezobuchwepheshe, ngemiphumela yako, nakho kulawuleka.

B. Lokhu kuyavumelana nenkolelo yokumiselwa okungokwezobuchwepheshe ngoba isho ukuthi ukuthuthuka kwezobuchwepheshe akunqunyelwe yizinto zamasiko.

C. Lokhu kuyavumelana nenkolelo yokumiselwa okungokwezobuchwepheshe ngoba isho ukuthi ubuchwepheshe bunomthelela ongokwemvelo emphakathini.

D. Lokhu kuyavumelana nenkolelo yokumiselwa okungokwezobuchwepheshe ngoba isho ukuthi ukuthuthuka kwezobuchwepheshe akunqunyelwe ezepolitiki."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yikuphi okulandelayo okubonisa ukuthi akuhlobene neze nokudonsa umnsalo?","The correct answer is **A: Umsindo ophansi kamnandi**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that a ""top bow"" (represented by the ""V"" symbol) makes a quiet sound. The passage then states that a ""bottom bow"" makes a stronger and harder sound.

Therefore, a quiet sound is not related to the ""bottom bow""."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ukuphi okulandelayo okuhlotshaniswa umsindo omnene?","The correct answer is **C: Umaka ofana neV**.

The passage states: ""Umnsalo ophezulu ujwayele ukwenza umsindo opholile, kanti umnsalo ophansi wenza umsindo onamandla noqinile kakhudlwana."" It also states that the ""uphawu """"lokukhothama umile"""" olubukeka njengo-V"". Therefore, the ""V"" mark is associated with a softer sound.
"
Izinsalelo zamathambo ziveza ukuthi izandla zajwayela ukwenza muphi umsebenzi ojwayelekile?,"The correct answer is **A: Manipulation**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the fossilized hand bones indicate a shift ""from locomotion to manipulation."" This means the hand evolved to be used more for handling objects and less for movement.
*   Other options:
    *   B: Heavy carrying - While humans can carry heavy objects, the passage emphasizes dexterity for specific tasks.
    *   C: Locomotion - The passage says human hands evolved *away* from locomotion.
    *   D: Knuckle-walking - This is associated with chimpanzees, and the passage contrasts them with humans."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuchaza ngokunembile isandla se-chimpanzee? ,"The correct answer is **C: Zisebenza ukuthwala okusindayo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Isandla se-chimpanzee kanye nonyawo ziyafana ngobukhulu kanye nobude, okubonisa ukusetshenziswa kwesandla ekuthwaleni isisindo ekuhambeni ngamaqupha."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aqondile kunezomuntu’:** The passage implies the opposite; human hands are more adapted for precise tasks due to straighter phalanges.
*   **B: Izandla nezinyawo kuyahluka ngesayizi:** The passage states that the hands and feet of chimpanzees are similar in size.
*   **D: Zisetshenziswa ukuzwisa ubuhlungu:** There is no mention of inflicting pain in the text.
"
Ukukhetha kususa kuphi ukuhluka okusha kwe-genetic kwi-pool?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukuveza okuthile**.

The passage states that selection removes from ""expressed variation"".
"
Iyiphi into enomsebenzi wokugcwaliselela i-genetic variation?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukuguquka kwezakhi zofuzo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""Ukuguquka kwenza ukwahluka kwezakhi zofuzo okusha..."" This directly links mutation to creating new genetic variation.
*   The other options are related to how genetic variation is *managed* or *expressed*, but mutation is the fundamental source.
    *   Ukuhlukanisa (Segregation) and Ukuhlanganisa futhi (Recombination) shuffle existing variation.
    *   Ukuveza okuthile (Expression) is the *result* of genetic variation, not the *cause* of it."
"Ngokuya kwemininingwane okulesi siquphu, ikuphi okulapha okumelwe kudliwe uhlobo oluthile lwabantu ukuze kuxazulule ikinga “ye-protein”?","The correct answer is **C: Izinthethe** (Grasshoppers).

Here's why:

The passage states:

*   Humans, like certain animals, struggle to get enough amino acids from available plants in a forest environment.
*   Leaf and shoot proteins are difficult to digest unless cooked.
*   Animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easily digestible and provide high-quality protein with essential amino acids.
*   The ancestors must have solved the ""protein problem"" in the same way as savanna baboons

Based on this, the logical conclusion is that the human ancestors needed to consume animal protein, such as insects, to meet their protein needs in a forest environment.

Other options are incorrect because:

*   A: Amahlamvu afile (Dead leaves) - The passage mentions leaf proteins but notes their difficulty to digest unless cooked.
*   B: AmaLegumes ahlaza (Raw legumes) - The passage does not mention legumes as source of protein.
*   D: Isiqu sezimbali (Flower stems) - The passage does not mention flower stems as a source of protein."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iziphi izikinga ezibalwe lana azibangeni ukungatholi okubalulekile kwe-amino acids?","The correct answer is **A: Izinkinga zokugaya (Problems with digestion)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that difficulty in digestion, specifically of readily available plant sources like leaves and shoots, *leads to* the inability to satisfy amino acid requirements. The consequences of *that* inability are stunted growth, malnutrition, and premature death. So, digestion problems are the cause, and the other options are the consequences.
"
Kunganjani abantu be-subculture ngokwesinye isikhathi bagqamisa isizathu sokuba kuleli qembu?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngokusebenzisa isitayela njenge ndlela yophawu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that subculture members often express their membership through a ""distinct and symbolic style, including fashion, behavior, and manner of speaking."" This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngokuzama ukuzihlanganisa (By trying to integrate)**: While some members of subcultures might eventually integrate into mainstream society, the primary purpose of highlighting their belonging is not integration, but rather expressing identity and solidarity within the subculture.
*   **B: Ngokuvumela izinkolelo zabantu ababazungezile (By allowing the beliefs of the people around them)**: Subcultures often form precisely because individuals *don't* align with the beliefs of the mainstream population. Highlighting belonging is a way to reinforce their alternative beliefs.
*   **C: Ngokuvumelana imithetho yomphakathi (By conforming to the rules of society)**: Again, subcultures often distinguish themselves by deviating from societal norms.

"Ngokuya kwalombono ovezwe lana, kungenzeka ini kumntwana ophawulwe izimpawu zobandlululo okuhambisana nomcabango ojwayelekile ekuhileleni ekuziphatheni okuhambisana nakho?","Based on the premise provided, the most likely answer is **B: Umntwana kungenzeka aziphathe ngendlela engafanele.**

Here's why:

*   **The Premise:** The passage states that children internalize racial stereotypes and that these stereotypes impact their behavior. For example, if a child from a minority group is constantly exposed to the idea that their race doesn't perform well in school, they are more likely to underperform when they learn that stereotype associated with their race.

*   **Applying the Premise:** Therefore, if a child is labeled with a negative stereotype, they are more prone to act in a way that is not favorable because of the stereotypes associated with them. This doesn't necessarily imply that the child will want to shy away from these stereotypes.

**Why the other options are less likely:**

*   **A: Umntwana uzozama ukubalekela ukuziphatha kokweyisa:** While it is possible that the child will attempt to avoid the behaviors associated with stereotypes, the premise indicates they are more likely to behave as though the stereotypes are true.
*   **C: Umntwana kungenzeka azihlukanise nomphakathi:** This is a possible outcome, but the premise focuses more on internalized stereotypes affecting behavior, not necessarily leading to social isolation.
*   **D: Umntwana kuzokunqaba ukuhlanganisa nezinye izinhlanga:** This is also a possibility, but the primary impact discussed in the premise is the effect of stereotypes on a child's own actions and beliefs.

Therefore, the most logical answer is B because it reflects the premise that children who are exposed to negative stereotypes and racial prejudice are likely to act in a way that corresponds to those stereotypes."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ulwazi lomntwana alaziyo ngobandlululo okujwayelekile kungaba nomthelela kuziphi izinto ezilandelayo?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuziphatha kwabo (Their behavior)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""lezi zinkolelo ezinganembile zobuhlanga zithinta indlela eziziphatha ngayo (these inaccurate racial stereotypes affect the way they behave)"". The example about minority children performing poorly in school reinforces this point.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okungeke kuhambisane nokukhulise komntwana oyisilwane?","The passage states that feral children often exhibit behaviors similar to the animals that raised them, including fear of or indifference to humans. This implies:

*   **Living independently:** If raised by animals or alone in the wild, they would need to live independently.
*   **A tendency to isolate:** Fear of or indifference to humans would lead to isolation.
*   **Being startled by society:** Having no experience with human society would cause them to be startled by it.

The passage does not suggest that feral children would have **strong communication skills**. In fact, it implies the opposite, as they wouldn't have learned human language or social cues.

Therefore, the answer is **B: Amakhono anamandla wokukhulumisana**"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okuqondile okuchaza ukuphatha kwesilwane komntwana?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuziphatha okwesilwane okunengi kubangelwa ukungahlangani nabantu njalo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lapho ikhuliswe ngokuphelele isilwane ekungesona umuntu, ingane enobulwane iveza ukuziphatha (ngokulinganiselwa okungokoqobo) cishe okufana ngokuphelile nokwesilwane ebesiyinakekela, njengokusaba noma ukungabi nandaba nabantu.""  This directly implies that the animalistic behavior stems from the *lack* of human interaction and instead, being raised by an animal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukuziphatha njengesilwane kubangelwa ukuhlangazihlanganisi nabantu:** The passage doesn't say interaction *with* humans causes animalistic behavior. It's the *lack* of appropriate human interaction.
* **C: Ukuziphatha okwesilwane kubonakala kubantwana ebebavalelwe abazali babo:** While some feral children were locked away by their parents, this isn't the *cause* of the animalistic behavior. The cause is the isolation and lack of proper socialization. Also, the behavior comes from those raised by animals.
* **D: Konke ukuziphatha kwesilwane kubangwa ukukhubazeka kwegqondo:** The passage mentions that some children are abandoned due to parental intolerance of disabilities, but it does *not* state that all animalistic behavior stems from a mental disability. Furthermore, the passage directly links the animalistic behavior to being raised by non-human animals.

Ikuphi okulandelayo okunembile okuchaza ukwenza ezolimo kwasemakhaya?,"Ngokusekelwe embhalweni, impendulo efanele ithi:

**A: Uhlelo lokulima okuphilayo**

Nasi isizathu:

Umbhalo uchaza ukulimela ukuziphilisa njengendlela elula, ngokuvamile okususelwe ezintweni eziphilayo, kusetshenziswa imbewu egciniwe yasendaweni. Lokhu kuchaza izici eziyinhloko zokulima okuphilayo, okugxile ekusebenziseni izinsiza zemvelo kanye nokunciphisa ukuthembela ezintweni zokwenziwa.

Nakhu ukuthi kungani ezinye izinketho zingafaneleki:

*   **B: Isebenzisa indlela ehlukile yokonga izitshalo:** Nakuba ukushintshashintsha izilimo kungahle kusetshenziswe ekulimeni ukuziphilisa, akukhona isici esiyinhloko noma esichazayo.
*   **C: Ivumela abalimi ukuba babelane izitshalo esigodini sonke:** Nakuba ukwabelana ngesitshalo kungenzeka emphakathini ozenzelayo, akukhona isici esichazayo.

Ukuvakashela imnyuziyami kuwela ngaphansi kwasi isigaba kwezokuvakasha?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: Kwezokuvakasha zamasiko**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Uma inhloso yokuhambela komuntu endaweni ethile ukwazi umlando wawo namasiko ke lolu hlobo lwezokuvakasha luyaziwa njengokuvakasha ukuthi uyofunda amasiko."" (If a person's purpose in traveling to a place is to learn about its history and culture, then this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.)
*   Museums are places where history and culture are preserved and displayed.
*   Therefore, visiting a museum falls under the category of cultural tourism."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iyiphi into esemqoka kwabavakashi kwezokuzijabulisa?","The correct answer is **B: Baziphumuza ngalokho abajwayele ukukwenza nzuku zonke**.

The passage states that leisure tourism is when people go to a place ""e hlukile kakhulu kulokho abakwenza nsukuzonke ngokuvamile ukuze bayoncebeleka futhi bazijabulise"" which translates to ""very different from what they do every day usually to relax and have fun"".
"
Yini eshiwo kulesi sigaba okuyinto enganciphisa uvalo lweshintso kumasonto asendaweni?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukukhumbula ukuphumelela ekuziphatheni kahle kwezinto zamabhizinisi** (Remembering past instances of ethical business practices).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ukukhumbula izimo ezidlule zokuziphatha kwezamabhizinisi kanye nempumelelo ebakhona kwasiza abantu bamukele izinguquko kanye nendlela entsha yesonto lendawo. Izindaba ezinjalo zempumelelo zanciphisa ukwesaba ushintsho, zibe zenza ukuthambekela okuhle oshintshweni lwesikhathi esizayo."" This directly links recalling past successes in business dealings to reducing the fear of change within local churches.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **B: Ukuthola ulwazi kubantu abaqguqguzela isiko lequmbu** (Gaining knowledge from people who influence group culture): While the passage mentions understanding the influence of individuals on organizational culture, it doesn't directly link that understanding to *reducing the fear* of change.
*   **C: Ukuqaphela ukuthola amandla kwaleqembu** (Realizing the acquisition of power by the group): The passage does not directly mention acquisition of power or its relation to fear of change.
*   **D: Ukuqonda umlando kwaleliqembu** (Understanding the history of the group): While understanding history provides context, the passage *specifically highlights* the impact of remembering past *successes* in business practices as the factor that lessens the fear of change.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate and direct answer based on the information provided in the passage.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ukuzuza umando womuntu kusiza kuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Ukunciphisa uvalo loshintsho (Reducing the fear of change)**

The passage states: ""Izindaba ezinjalo zempumelelo zanciphisa ukwesaba ushintsho, zibe zenza ukuthambekela okuhle oshintshweni lwesikhathi esizayo."" This directly translates to ""Such stories of success reduced the fear of change, while creating a positive inclination towards future change.""

Ikuphi okulandelayo okuqhaza kahle ngokunembile ipostmodern yokufunda?,"Impendulo efanele yi **D: Akukho umuntu ophelele ekufundeni**.

**Incazelo:**

Indlela yokufunda ye-postmodern igcizelela:

*   **Ukungabi bikho kwemikhawulo:** Indlela yendabuko yokufunda eyodwa ayisebenzi.
*   **Ukuhlukahluka:** Akukho lutho oluyinto eyodwa kuphela umuntu okumele ayifunde.
*   **Ukuzibandakanya:** Ukufunda kudinga ukuzibandakanya phakathi komfundi nolwazi olunikeziwe.

Izitatimende ze-P zikhuluma ngendlela yokufunda lapho silwazi oluningi olutholayo kodwa singalusebenzisi lolo lwazi ngempela. Lokhu kusikisela ukuthi ukufunda okungenzeka (noma ukuthola ulwazi olwengeziwe) akusho ukuthi umuntu ukwenza ngendlela ephelele.

Ezinye izinketho azihambelani kangako nalokho okugxilwe kukho yi-postmodern yokufunda:

*   **A: Ukufunda komakade ebona kuzuzisa kakhulu kunabanye:** Indlela ye-postmodern ivame ukungathathi hlangothi, futhi ingavumelani nokuthi kunendlela eyodwa engcono.
*   **B: Ukufunda kumelwe sigxile kulokho esinethemba lokuthi kuzokwenzeka:** Lokhu akuboniswa ngezitatimende ezishiwo.

This aligns with the provided text about drinking more liquid before sleeping in order to wake up to urinate. This is the most normal and natural process when waking up to go to the bathroom and get back to bed. This will not disrupt the sleeping cycle since the process is intentional.
Options A, C, and D would all likely disrupt the sleep cycle more significantly because they involve either being awake for a longer time (A and C) or some sort of movement (D).

Ikuphi okulandelayo okungalimaza ukucacisa amaphupho emzimbeni?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuncishiswa kweREM ngobusuku** (Reduction of REM per night).

Here's why:

*   The passage argues that lucid dreaming extends the periods between REM states.
*   It also states that fewer REM periods lead to less restorative sleep.
*   Therefore, anything that causes a reduction in the overall amount of REM sleep would be detrimental."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, afana ngani amaqembu ahlangana ngokoqobo nalawa ahlangana kuzinto zokuxhumana?","The correct answer is **A: Amaqembu amabili alindele ukuthi adlale ngokwezinga elifanayo**

The passage states: ""Amaqembu abukeka njengangokoqobo aphathwa ngezimiso ezifanayo zobuhle njengamaqembu angokwesiko, kepha kunomehluko ocashile."" This directly translates to ""Virtual teams are treated with the same principles of aesthetics as traditional teams, but there is a subtle difference."" Therefore, both types of teams are expected to perform to the same standards. The rest of the options are describing the differences rather than the similarities."

* **The passage focuses on needs and desires formed *early in life* and how these pre-existing motivations drive behavior.** New desires that *develop* over time aren't explicitly addressed within the scope of the paragraph. While the theories *could* be applied to new desires, the passage itself doesn't say they do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kubonisa ukuthi okuzungeze umuntu kungathinta izinto zakhe:** The passage *explicitly* states that these theories explore ""iziphi izinto endaweni yabo ezizobenza benze noma bangenzi ezinye izinto"" (what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things).
* **C: Izidingo zangaphakathi:** The passage mentions that people have ""izidingo ezithile kanye/noma izifiso eziye zavalelwa ngaphakathi"" (certain needs and/or desires that have been bottled up inside). So this is covered.
* **D: Ukuqonda ukuthi abantu bathandani:** The passage discusses what motivates people to pursue what they want, which is closely related to understanding their preferences.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that zoom lenses have a lower ""isivinini,"" which translates to a smaller aperture (ukuvuleka). A smaller aperture means less light enters the lens.
*   It then states that cheaper zoom lenses are not ideal in low-light situations without a flash (isibani).
*  It states that zoom lenses allow to produce another level of quality.

Therefore, if you need a wide aperture (more light) or don't want to use a flash in dim environments, a zoom lens might not be the best choice. However, Zoom lenses can produce another level of quality in complex focus."

"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okungekona ukugxilisa kwiMysticism?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Ukucizelela kokuhle komkhumbulo (Emphasis on the goodness of remembrance)**.

Here's why:

"
Isiphi isimo esingavumela indlela ye-origamu yePureland izuzise ifolda?,"The correct answer is **D: Ifolda ikuzamile kanye noma kabili lokho**

Here's why:

*   Pureland origami is designed for beginners or those with limited motor skills. Therefore, someone who has only tried origami a couple of times would benefit from its simplified rules.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   A: Ifolda ithanda ukwenza amafolda amanengi ngesikhi sinye: Pureland origami's limitations would likely frustrate someone who enjoys complex, multi-step folds.
*   B: Ifolda seyithuthuke ngendlela yokuthi inekhona njengemoto: This is nonsensical and irrelevant to the benefits of Pureland origami.
*   C: Ifolda iyenza i-origami le edinga ukuhlehllisa kwe-folds: Pureland origami specifically avoids reverse folds, so it would not be suitable for such models."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungachazi ngokunembile iPureland origami?,"The correct answer is **A: Iyenzelwe okuhlangene nakho kwamafolda**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Pureland origami is for inexperienced folders OR those with limited motor skills. This is the opposite of for experienced folders.
*   The passage states that back folds are not allowed, this makes B the correct answer.
*   The passage states that all folds have precise locations, this makes C the correct answer.
*   The passage states that it is meant for those with limited motor skills, this makes D the correct answer."
"Ngokuya kwamomusho, iyiphi indawo engahlanganisiwe ne-Indus Valley Civilization?","The correct answer is **C: Zonke izindawo ezise-nyakatho-mpumalanga zaseAfghanistan**.

The passage states that the Indus Valley Civilization included ""izindawo ezithile entshonalanga nyakatho Ndiya nasempumalanga nyakatho Afghanistan"". This means some, but not necessarily *all*, areas in northeastern Afghanistan were part of the civilization.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungashiwongo okungekhe kube ithuba legama leBronze Age Civilization okukhulunywe ngakho esigabeni?,"The passage mentions the following as possible names for the Bronze Age Civilization:

*   **Indus Valley Civilization:** Directly stated in the first sentence.
*   **Indus-Sarasvati Civilization:** Mentioned because some scholars believe the civilization existed along the now-dried Sarasvati River as well.
*   **Harappan Civilization:** Mentioned as named after Harappa, one of the first excavated sites.

The passage does **not** explicitly mention ""Indus River Civilization"" as an alternative name. While the civilization thrived in the Indus River Valley, the passage doesn't specifically use that phrase as a potential name.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: i-Indus River Civilization**."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yikuphi okulandelayo kumelela into ezuzisayo yesikhathi eside?","Impendulo elungile ngu **A: Ukusebenzisana nabanye**.

The passage states that ""kuzohlale kunokuningi ongakuzuza ngesikhathi esifushane ngokuba nomhawu"" which translates to ""there will always be more to gain in the short term by being envious."" Therefore, someone focused on short-term gains would prioritize envy.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani owakhokhela izindleko zempi?","The correct answer is **D: Abantu baseFilipino**.

The passage explicitly states that the Filipino people were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover a large portion of the war costs.
"
Isiphi isikhathi esafika ngaphambi kweminyaka yeTemplars?,"The correct answer is **C: Ekuqaleni kweminyaka yeMiddle Ages** (Early Middle Ages).

The passage states: ""IHigh Middle Ages yandulelwa i-Early Middle Ages..."" meaning the Early Middle Ages came *before* the High Middle Ages, which is the period relevant to the Templars.
"
Isiphi isikhathi esafika ngemva kweTemplars?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngasekupheleni kwemiyaka yeMiddle Ages (Late Middle Ages)**.

The passage explicitly states that the High Middle Ages were followed by the Late Middle Ages. Therefore, since the Templars existed during the High Middle Ages, the period that came after them was the Late Middle Ages.
"
Ikuphi ukulashwa okungavezwanga okwasetshenjiswa abodokotela banahlinzi ngesikhathi sombuso wamaRoma?,"Impendulo efanele ngu **A: Ukulapha ukugcindezeleka kwangemva kokuhlukumezeka ngokusebenzisa imithi ezihlukahlukene elalisayo**

Isizathu: Nakuba indatshana ikhuluma ngezindlela ezahlukene zokulalisa (ezifana ne-morphine ne-scopolamine), ayisho ukuthi le mithi yayisetshenziselwa ngokuqondile ukwelapha i-PTSD noma ezinye izimo zempilo yengqondo. Izinketho B, C, no-D zikhulunywa ngokuqondile njengezindlela zokwelapha ezazisetshenziswa ngabahlengikazi baseRoma."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okungeke kwanikelwa udomo ekuthuthukiseni ezokwelapha ngesikhathi sokubuso amaRoma?","The correct answer is **C: Indlela okufundwa ngayo ezibhedlela (How learning was conducted in hospitals)**.

The passage discusses Roman advancements in surgical techniques, anesthesia, and the establishment of a military medical corps. It also mentions the emperor's role in hiring doctors. However, it does **not** mention anything about how medical education or learning was conducted in hospitals. Thus, that is the contribution not mentioned in the passage.
"
"Ingabe ukubona, noma ukukwazi ukubona kuncike kuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Uhlelo lwezinzwa zokubona noma amehlo.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Ukubona, noma ukukwazi ukubona kuncike ohlelweni lwezinzwa zokubona noma amehlo.""
"
Ukwakheka kweso kwezinto ezizizungezile ezincani zixhomeke kuphi?,"The correct answer is **C: Izinga lokuhluka**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that eye structures vary in complexity depending on the needs of the organism. This implies that the level of detail needed to discern differences in the environment (the ""degree of discrimination"" or ""izinga lokuhluka"") is a key factor shaping eye structure."
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, isiphi isitatimende isikhuluma ngoSikhism esingaqondanga esiveza inkolo?","The incorrect statement about Sikhism is:

*   **C: Abafundisi besiHindu abayisishagalolunye balandela ngemva komsunguli wenkolo, Mfundii uNanak**

This statement is incorrect because it claims that 9 *Hindu* teachers followed Guru Nanak. The passage explicitly states that nine *Sikh* Gurus followed Guru Nanak.
"
"Ngokuya kwalesi sigaba, ikuphi okulandelayo okucatshangelwa ukuthi umgogotla wokukholwa kweSikh?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Uqondo womfundi wesiHindu**.

The passage states: ""...enkolweni yobuSikh unokubaluleka okwakha umnyombo wezinkolelo zobuSikh."" (In Sikhism, the concept of the guru is of such importance that it forms the core of Sikh beliefs).
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, abantwana abanenkinga yokuzwa bangakuthola kunzima ukuxila kuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Umsebenzi wesikole**.

The passage states, ""Izingane ezine-ADD zibhekana nobunzima uma kufanele ukuthi zibhekane nemisebenzi yazo yesikole..."" (Children with ADD struggle when they have to deal with their school work).  The other options are explicitly mentioned as activities they CAN focus on.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kungani abantwana abanenkinga wokuzwa bangaze bazifake enkinga yokuziphatha okuyingozi?","The correct answer is **D: Ukuququzela izinqgondo zabo** (To stimulate their minds).

The passage states: ""Lezi zingane zizithola zisobishini ngenxa ”yokuzigaxa ekuziphatheni okuyingozi, ziyalwa, zilwisana nabasegunyeni” ukuze nje zishukumise izingqondo zazo, njengoba izingqondo zazo zingashukunyiswa ngezindlela ezivamile.""

This directly links the risky behavior to the need for stimulation. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Ukunciphisa ukunyakaza kakhulu** (To reduce too much movement): While hyperactivity is a symptom of some forms of ADD, the passage emphasizes the need for *mental* stimulation, not just physical activity reduction.
*   **B: Ukubasiza ukuba bakwazi ukwakha ubungani nontanga yabo** (To help them to be able to form friendships with their peers): The passage states the opposite, that their behavior *hurts* their relationships.
*   **C: Ukunaka okumelwe kubuye kubazali** (Attention that must be returned from parents): While attention-seeking behavior can be a component, the passage's primary explanation is the need for brain stimulation."
"Ngokuya kwalemininigwane kulesi sigaba, yikuphi okulandelayo okungekona isibonelo se-scaffolding?","Based on the passage, scaffolding is defined as a resource that provides assistance to individuals learning something new, like using a new computer program or starting a new project. Examples given include a teacher and the paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office. The passage also mentions that computer-based scaffolds are embedded within an application to prompt, cue, and explain processes.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Okokufundisa ekuqaleni kwegame yekhompuyutha**: This fits the definition of scaffolding as it provides initial assistance in learning how to play the game.
*   **B: Uthisha weSAT**: This fits the definition of scaffolding as a teacher provides assistance in learning the material for the SAT.
*   **C: Uhlelo oluzimele lokufundisa**: This is the best answer as it implies that the program is self-directed and doesn't offer individual support or targeted help based on the learner's specific needs.
*   **D: Umqeqeshi we-league yabancani**: This fits the definition of scaffolding as a coach provides assistance in learning the sport.

Therefore, the option that is **not** an example of scaffolding is **C: Uhlelo oluzimele lokufundisa**."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungachazi ngokuqondile umbono we- scaffolding?,"The passage states that scaffolding is **not** a method of learning but rather a resource that provides assistance. Therefore, the option that does not directly describe the view of scaffolding presented in the passage is:

*   **C: Iyaziwa ngokuthi uhlelo oluthile lokufundisa** (It is known as a specific teaching program)

The other options are consistent with the passage:

*   **A: IScaffolds iyakhona ezinkundleni zokuxhumana** (Scaffolds are available in social environments) - This could be true, as a teacher is a type of scaffold.

*   **B: Icebo kakhulu kunensiza kufundisa** (More of a plan than teaching assistance) - While the text does not say it, it is implied that scaffolding is more of a temporary support than a teaching plan.

*   **D: AmaScaffolds asetshenziselwa ukusekela ukufundeni kwasekuqaleni** (Scaffolds are used to support initial learning) - The passage mentions that scaffolding is used when learning something new."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iMySpace ingabasiza njani abafundi laba abakuthola kunzima ukufunda?","The correct answer is **C: IWeb address eyodwa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that these websites (including MySpace, although it's used as an example) are helpful because the class page can be accessed through ""providing only one web address, which makes it easy to remember and easy to write for students who may have trouble with keyboarding or spelling.""
*   The other options are incorrect because they are features of MySpace or general information about it, but they don't specifically address how MySpace might help students with learning difficulties (especially related to keyboarding or spelling)."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo bekungekona ukusabela kwakaiKrushchev esitelekeni?","Based on the passage, the following is **NOT** a response by Khrushchev to the strikes:

*   **C: Khuphula umholo**

The passage states that the workers were protesting wage reductions. While Khrushchev did concede to some economic demands, there is no indication that he raised wages.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo bekungeyona imbangela yesiteleka sasePoland?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukukhethwa kukaWladyslaw Gomulka**.

The passage states the strikes were about food shortages and wage cuts and evolved into a protest against Communism. The selection of Gomulka was a result *of* the strikes, not a cause *of* them.

Lokhu kusho ukuthi ukuhluka kwamasiko (A), imibono ehlukene yokuthuthuka (C) kanye nokungqubuzana mayelana nezinhlelo (D) yizona ezikhinyabeze ubudlelwano phakathi kweUSSR ne-USA. Ngakho, impendulo engazange ichithe ubudlelwano phakathi kwe-USSR ne-USA yimibono ngeGermany.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungacazi ngokuqondile injongo yenzinzwa yokuthumela ama-impulse emzimbeni wonke?,"Impendulo efanele ithi: **A: Ukwehlisa ukuhamba kwegazi**

Isizathu:

*   Isitatimende sithi izinzwa zithumela imiyalezo yezinzwa ukugcina umjikelezo wegazi uqhubeka ungaphazamiseki (ukugcina ukuhamba kwegazi). Ukwehlisa ukuhamba kwegazi kungaphikisana nalokhu.
*   Izinketho B (Ukulawula ukugeleza kwegazi), C (Ukulawula i-homeostasis), no-D (Ukubalekela izinto ezingalimaza umzimba) zonke ziyahambisana nenjongo yezinzwa zokuthumela ama-impulse emzimbeni wonke."
Yini etholakala kuGiza Plateau?,"The correct answer is **A: Amathuna**, **B: Amathempeli**, and **D: The Great Pyramid**.

The passage states that the Giza Plateau includes:

*   ""iminye imibhoshongo emingxa-ntathu eminingana"" (including the Great Pyramid)
*   ""amathuna amaningana amancane""
*   ""amathempeli amaningana""

Therefore, A, B, and D are all correct. While the Great Pyramid is one of the seven wonders, the Giza Plateau includes more than just that, so C is not the most accurate answer.
"
Kwakuyini injongo yeGreat Pyramid?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuhlonipha uPharoah**

The passage states: ""IThafa Eliphakeme laseGiza...linemibhoshongo eminingxa-ntathu eminingana (leyo umbhoshongo omkhulu kuyiwo omkhulu kakhulu), amathuna amaningana amancane, amathempeli amaningana, kanye ne-Sphinx enkulu. Umbhoshongo omkhulu ongunxa-ntathu wakhelwe ukuhlonipha uFaro uKhufu, futhi neminye imibhoshongo engunxa-ntathu emincanyana, amathuna, kanye namathempeli akhelwe ukuhlonipha inkosikazi kaKhufu kanye namalungu omndeni.""

This clearly indicates that the primary purpose of the Great Pyramid, and the other structures in the Giza Necropolis, was to honor the Pharaoh (Khufu) and his family.
"
Umthwalo wemfanelo kabani ukuze sazi ukuthi i-arsonist iyamosha ithempeli?,"The correct answer is **C: uStrabo**.

*   Umbhalo uthi ithempeli lakhiwa kabusha ngo-323 BCE, ngemva kokuba u-Alexander efile. Lokhu kususa u-C no-D.
*   UHerostratus wayengumuntu owabhubhisa ithempeli futhi akazange atshelwe ukuba akhokhele ukwakhiwa kabusha kwalo."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kwakukuni lapho izilwane zaqala ukuhamba ngezinyawo ezimbil?","The correct answer is **A: Iminyaka eyisigidi yesikhombisa eyadlula**.

The passage states ""...nakuba ama-Sahelanthropus kungenzeka ayehamba ngezinyawo ezimbili ngaphambili kakhulu eminyakeni eyizigidi eziyisikhombisa edlule."" This indicates that the earliest possible evidence suggests bipedalism could have started around 7 million years ago.
"
Hlobo luni lwezilwane ezahamba ngezinyawo ezimbili?,"The correct answer is **D: i-Australopithecus**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that experts found evidence of bipedalism (walking on two feet) in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years. While Sahelanthropus *may* have been bipedal even earlier, the passage gives stronger and more definitive evidence for Australopithecus. Also, Homo Erectus followed after.

The other options are not as suitable:
* A: Sahelanthropus *may* have been bipedal, but there is not enough evidence in the passage to support this answer.
* B: Homo Erectus walked upright but followed after the others
* C: This response is not an animal species, it is an action"

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Amangisi namaMelika**.
"

"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kukuphi lapho ongeke uthole umuntu owaseBhabhiloni?","The correct answer is **D: Ukuletha iminikelo ngaphakathi kwendawo engcwele**.

Inkosi uTutankhamun waluthola nini udumo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngemva ngokutholwa kwethuna lakhe** (After the discovery of his tomb).

The passage explicitly states: ""Nokho, ukutholwa kwethuna lakhe ngo-1922 kwamenza usowaziwayo."" (However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous.)
"
Yini eyenza Inkosi uTutankhamun waduma njenge Nkosi yaseEgibhite?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukutholwa kwethuna lakhe elingathintwanga (The discovery of his untouched tomb)**.

The passage states: ""Nokho, ukutholwa kwethuna lakhe ngo-1922 kwamenza usowaziwayo. Nakuba amathuna amaningi wangezikhathi ezidlule egcekeziwe, leli thuna lalishiywe cishe lingaphazanyiswanga."" (However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous. While many tombs of the past were looted, this tomb was left almost undisturbed.) This directly supports option A as the reason for his modern fame.

"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungeyona inxenye yedile laseRoma lakudala?,"The correct answer is **D: Isitsha se-turkey eyosiwe**.

Ikuphi okulandelayo okungachazi ngokunembile amabhubesi?,"The most inaccurate description of lions from the passage is:

**A: Baziphathisa okwezinja ezeninengi**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly compares lions to *meerkat* societies, not dog societies. It highlights their cooperative behavior and group dynamics, which is more akin to meerkats.

Let's look at why the other options are more accurate:

*   **B: Isilinganiso samadoda nabesifazane asilingani** - The passage states there is one to three males, but more than three females in a pride, which means the balance is off.
*   **C: Amadoda nabesifazane bayahlobana** - The passage says that the females are usually related, and the males can be related.
*   **D: Bobabili bayingozi futhi banobungani** - The passage states that they are dangerous to animals they hunt and that they function as a pride, which means they can be friendly with each other.

Ukuphi okuphishwa abantu okuthathwa izilwane?,"The correct answer is **D: Umoya okhishwa umuntu ngemva kokuphefumula**.

The passage states ""izitshalo zithatha i-carbon-dioxide leyo ekhishwa abantu (okungukuthi, ukuphefumula ukhiphe umoya)"". Carbon dioxide is the main component of the air that humans exhale.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iziphi izibonelo eziveziwe ezingaphazamisa uhlelo lokuziphendukela kwemvelo?","The correct answer is **A: Iqembu elincane elihluleka ukuthuthuka endaweni entsha.**

Here's why:

*   The passage describes how a small group becoming isolated in a new environment with different resources and competitors drives the formation of new species (speciation). This happens *because* the small group needs to adapt and evolve.
*   If the small group **fails to thrive** in the new environment (option A), then the process of adaptation and divergence from the original group would not happen, disrupting the described speciation process.

Let's analyze why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Inxenye yabantu abanengi abathuthela endaweni entsha:** While migration can influence evolution, a large group moving might not experience the same selective pressures and genetic drift as a small, isolated group, making speciation less likely. The passage focuses on small groups.
*   **C: Abantu abanengi abazama ukujwayela ukuhlala endaweni entsha:** A large population trying to adapt might lead to adaptation within that population, but it's less likely to cause a split leading to a new species in the same way a small isolated group would.
*   **D: Iqembu labantu elizophindeka kabili:** While population booms can accelerate evolutionary changes, it does not disturb evolution.

Therefore, only option A has the potential to disrupt the speciation process as described in the passage."

The passage states: ""...i-Apple iyazise ngezigamego zokushisa ngokweqile ezengeziwe ezingu-34, lezo inkampani ezibize ngokuthi """"into engeyona enkulu."""""" ( ""...Apple reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as ""not significant."""")

Therefore, Apple is the one who called the incidents ""not significant"".
"
"Phakathi nenkulumo, utheni uSteve Jobs nge-Apple mayelana nokwenziwa futhi?","The correct answer is **A: UMlando**.

The quote in the passage states: ""Namuhla i-Apple izokwakha ngenye indlela ifoni, **Sizokwenza umlando namuhla**."" (Today Apple is going to build the phone in a different way, **We are going to make history today**.)
"
Kwakuyini injongo yenkulumo kaSteve Jobs yamahora amabili?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukukhipha i-phone entsha** (To release a new phone).

The text clearly states that Steve Jobs said, ""Namuhla i-Apple izokwakha ngenye indlela ifoni"" (Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone). This indicates the purpose of his speech was to introduce a new phone.
"
Yini uCristina Fernandez de Krichner ayisho eArgentine Theatre?,"The correct answer is **A: Ithuba lakhe lokuba wumongameli**.

The passage states that ""Nkk. Kirchner umemezelo inhloso yakhe yokukhankasela ukuba umongameli"" in the Argentine Theatre. This directly translates to her announcing her bid to be president.
"

The passage states: ""UNkk. Kirchner umemezelo inhloso yakhe yokukhankasela ukuba umongameli eThiyetheni yase-Ajenthina, indawo efanayo ayisebenzisele ukuqala umkhankaso wakhe wokuba ilunga leSigele njengelunga lamanxusa esifunda sase-Buenos Aires."" and ""eLa Plata, idolobha elingamakhilomitha angu-50 (amamayela angu-31) kusuka eBuenos Aires.""
"
Yini okutholwe yi-ACMA mayelana neBig Brother?,"The correct answer is **A: Umthetho wokufihla ulwimi olungahlanzekile awuphulwanga**.

B: uJohn Howard
"
Kungani i-Australia inganawo imboni ye-nuclear?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer cannot be definitively determined. The passage only indicates that Peter Costello believes Australia should pursue nuclear energy if it becomes economically viable. It does not explicitly state why Australia currently *lacks* a nuclear industry.

While options like ""too expensive"" might be inferred as a potential reason, the passage doesn't provide concrete evidence to support any of the options over the others.

The passage states: ""Umshushuluzi waseqhweni wase-Poland wesigaba sabesilisa abangaboni kahle u-Maciej Krezel nomqondisi u-Anna Ogarzynska uqede endaweni yeshumi nantathu kuyi-Super-G."" This clearly indicates that Maciej Krezel is a visually impaired skier who uses a guide. While Anna Ogarzynska is the guide, the question asks for the skier who finished with guidance.
"
Iliphi izwe laqeda endaweni yesishumi ku-Super-G yabesifazane?,"The correct answer is **A: i-Finland**.

The passage states that Katja Saarinen of Finland finished in tenth place in the women's standing Super-G event.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okushiwo ngoBlake okungelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **B: Wavuma ukuthi uhlaselile.**

The passage states that the broadcaster, ""ukuphikile ukuhlaselwa"" (denied the attack). Therefore, it is false that he admitted to attacking. All the other options are consistent with information presented in the passage.
"
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, ikuphi okulandeyo okungenzekanga kuBlake?","Impendulo efanele ithi: **C: Bamuhlasela ngesigxobo**

Nansi incazelo:

*   **A: Watholwa anecala lokuziphatha okuphula umthetho:** Lo musho awusho ngokuqondile ukuthi utholwe enecala. Kusho kuphela ukuthi usolwa ngokuthile nokuthi ijaji licabanga ukuthi uzothunyelwa ejele.
*   **B: Waboshwa:** Lo musho usho ngokuqondile ukuthi uboshiwe endaweni yesigameko.
*   **C: Bamuhlasela ngesigxobo:** Lo musho uthi usebenzise uthi olude ukuze azivikele emabhodleleni. Lokhu kusho ukuthi abazange bamhlasela ngesigxobo.
*   **D: Watshelwa ukuthi amathuba wokuthi aye ejele manengi:** Ijaji lisho ngokuqondile ukuthi ""cishe kwakungagwemeki"" ukuthi uzothunyelwa ejele.

Ngakho-ke, impendulo **C** iyona engenzekanga kuBlake ngokwalo musho."
Ukutholwa kwemali Yenhlangano Yezizwe Ezihlangene yokufudumala kwembulunga ngeke isetshenziswe kuphi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukwabelana ngezobuchwepheshe ukusiza amazwe athuthukayo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the UN fund will be used for:

*   **Izindlu ezingakhukhuleki (Houses that don't get washed away)**
*   **Indlela yokuphatha amanzi engcono (Better water management)**
*   **Izinhlobonhlobo zezitshalo (Different types of crops)**

The passage also says that another topic of discussion at the Bali meeting is sharing technology to help developing countries grow in cleaner ways, but this is separate from how the fund for global warming will be used.

Therefore, the only option that is NOT listed as a use for the UN global warming fund is sharing technology with developing countries. Option D is a general description of the fund's purpose, not a specific way the money won't be used.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yikuphi iNhlangano Yezizwe Ezihlangane efisa ukukusiza?","The correct answer is **A: Imali, ngokwabelana ngezobuchwepheshe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the UN wants to ""qedela isikhwama sokusiza amazwe athintwe ukufudumala kwembulunga yonke ukuba abhekane namathonya"" (complete a fund to help countries affected by global warming to cope with the effects), which implies the UN wants to provide money.
*   The first sentence says, "" nokwabelana ngezobuchwepheshe ukusiza amazwe athuthukayo ukuba akhule ngezindlela ezingangcolisi kakhulu"" (and share technology to help developing countries grow in less polluting ways.)

Let's eliminate other options:

*   **B: Izitshalo:** While the passage mentions using money for different kinds of plants, the UN's primary goal isn't just about providing plants.
*   **C: Amahlathi womhlaba asele:** This is a topic of discussion at the meeting, but not the specific assistance the UN wants to provide in this context.
*   **D: Abantu abathinteka mayelana nendlela yokuphatha amanzi engcono:** While people can be benefited from better water management, the people is not what the UN is assisting."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okwacaphunwa u-Albert Muchanga njengento okumelwe idingwe sivumelane nayo?,"The correct answer is **C: Umsuka womthetho**.

The passage states: ""Asikavumelani ngokuthi izothini imithetho yesiqalo nokuncishiswa kwamanani wezimpahla ezilethwa ezweni...""  ""Imithetho yesiqalo"" translates to ""rules of origin"".

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: Albert Muchanga announced Benin had joined, not whether it *could* join.
*   B: He mentions the date trade will start, but not as something they need to agree on.
*   D: Tax payments are not mentioned in the text."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kungani itrading ingaqala ngoJuly?","The correct answer is **B: Kunokuhleleka okuthile nemithetho kuhlanganise nenokuvumelana**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Asikavumelani ngokuthi izothini imithetho yesiqalo nokuncishiswa kwamanani wezimpahla ezilethwa ezweni, kodwa isimiso esinaso sanele ukuqala ukuhweba ngomhlaka-1 July, 2020"".  This means that although some rules were not yet in place, existing frameworks were deemed sufficient to begin trading.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: UKuqala kwenyanga kaJuly bekusehlelweni kweNigeria ukuba bajoyine AfCFTA:** While Nigeria's planned joining date is mentioned, the passage implies that trade can begin in July because of a *framework*, not solely because Nigeria is joining.
*   **C: Ukuvume i-AU trade kuhlanganise nemboni yezikhulu zekhomishani:** While the AU Trade and Industry commissioner is quoted, the start of trading is attributed to the existing framework, not just the commissioner's approval.
*   **D: Umsuka wezemithetho nokuvumelana ukukhokha intela osokuvumelene ngakho:** The passage mentions that the rules of origin and tariff reductions are *not yet* agreed upon, making this option incorrect."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, i- Atlanta Journal-Constitution ithwesa bani kubaphathi yezefundo?","Impendulo efanele ngu **C: Akwenziwe lutho ekuboneni izinkinga ezingaphakathi**

Isiqephu sisho ngokusobala ukuthi i-Atlanta Journal-Constitution yathi isikole (okuholela kubaphathi) sathola izinkinga ngaphakathi kodwa asizange senze lutho ngazo.
"
"Ngokuya ngalokho okunikeziwe kulo musho, ukuphi okungaqinisekiswanga kumbiko weAtlanta Journal-Constitution?","The correct answer is **B: Ubufakazi bokuthi amaphepha we-test aphazamisiwe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution *suspected* the school district had problems internally but did nothing about it. The passage later states it was revealed in 2013 that uHall and 34 other education officials tampered with test papers. The question asked what was not confirmed in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution report. This leads to the answer being the evidence the test papers were tampered with. This was not confirmed until 2013.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuthola inani elingalindelekile ku-test:** The passage states that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's report showed rapid gains in test scores. So, finding an unexpected gain in test scores was confirmed by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
*   **C: Owinile ku-2013’s National Superintendent:** The passage states uHall was given the title National Superintendent of the Year in 2009.
*   **D: Imibono ngokuthuthukisa imfundo emadolobheni:** The passage states uHall was recognized for modern urban education."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okwaziwayo ngokuqhum kwebhomu?","The best answer is **B: Yimaphi amabhilidi lapho kuqhume amabhomu khona** and **D: Inani labantu abashonile**.

Here's why:

*   **B: Yimaphi amabhilidi lapho kuqhume amabhomu khona** - The passage mentions that one bomb exploded outside the Prime Minister's office and three near government buildings.

*   **D: Inani labantu abashonile** - The passage mentions that the official death toll is eight, even if that number is not final.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isikhathi sokubala esise esisemqoka esibalulekile** - There is no mention of the time of the blast.

*   **C: Ukube amabhomu angezelelwe ayaqunyiswa** - The passage does not give any information about additional explosions being stopped."
"Njengoba ajoyina i-Manchester City ngo2017, mingakhi imidlalo uJesus sekayidlalile?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The passage states: ""Kusukela ngaleso sikhathi, umdlali waseBrazil wadlala emidlalweni engu-53 emincintiswaneni yonke..."" which means that Gabriel Jesus played 53 matches since joining the club.
"
Iliphiiqembu lebhola uJesus elafuna ukumnikela i-£27 million ngokulijoyina?,"The correct answer is **B: i-Manchester City**.

The passage states that Jesus joined Manchester City for £27 million.

"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okuyiqiniso?","The correct answer is **C: Izivakashi bezikhona ku-eve ye-hajj olungcwele**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Isakhiwo besihlalisa abahambeli ababezovakasha edolobheni elingcwele ngosuku olwandulela i-hajj pilgrimage."" This directly translates to the guests being there on the eve of the Hajj.
*   **A: Akekho olimele** - This is false because the passage mentions at least 15 deaths, implying injuries as well.
*   **B: Zonke izivakashi babuya eUnited Arab Emirates** - This is false. The passage only states that ""Iningi lezivakashi zehostela bekuyizakhamuzi zase-United Arab Emirates"" which means ""Most of the hostel guests were citizens of the United Arab Emirates"" and does not state that all of them were.
*   **D: Iningi lezivakashi bezizakhamuzi zaseMecca** - This is false. The passage explicitly states that most of the guests were citizens of the United Arab Emirates."
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, iluphi ulwazi mayelana nokushayisana okungaqondeki?","The correct answer is **A: Ubukhulu bokushayisana** and **C: Ukuthinteka kokushayisa komhlaba.**

The passage explicitly states that scientists are still trying to determine ""ukuthi kube kukhulu kangakanani ukugqubuzana nokuthi uMhlaba uzothinteka kanjani.""  This means the magnitude and impact on Earth are still unknown.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, okuphi okusafanele kubhekwe ngaloku kushayisana?","The correct answer is **D: Isikali esiqondile sokushayisa**

The passage explicitly states that scientists are ""still trying to figure out how big the collision was.""  This directly corresponds to option D. The other options are not explicitly brought up in the paragraph.

"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okubonisa ukuthi uBatten wafaka umnikelo khona?,"The correct answer is **B: INyuvesi yaseVirginia**.

"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okuyiqiniso mayelana nokulalela icala lakaMiller?","Impendulo efanele ngu **B: Ebengakalaleli njengoba bekasazilungisa**.

Incazelo: Umusho oqondile ovela esiqeshini uthi, ""bengizilungiselela ngakho angikuzwanga ayekusho."" Lokhu kusho ukuthi uMiller wayengakalaleli ngoba besazilungiselela.
"
Ubani oweza necebo lokuthi kumelwe kubuyekezwe i’Clean Air Act’?,"The correct answer is **C: uJack Layton**.

The passage states that ""u-Layton ucele kube nezinguquko endleleni yokukhipha irisidi yesikweletu phakathi nomhlangano nama-PM, ecela kube “nokubhalwa kabusha okuphelele” kwendlela yokukhipha irisidi yesikweletu."" Stephen Harper agreed to send the 'Clean Air Act' to an all-party committee for review after this meeting with Jack Layton. This implies Jack Layton requested the changes and therefore initiated the idea of reviewing the Act.
"
Ubani ongayithandanga i“Clean Air Act” ngoba ecabanga ukuthi isetshenjiswa ngaphambi kokuvota?,"The correct answer is **A: Uhulumeni wesifunda ogunyaziwe**.

The passage states that since the Commonwealth Government intervened in the administration of the Mersey Hospital in Devonport, Tasmania, ""the state government and other members of the Commonwealth government have accused the move as a precursor to a state election due in November"". This indicates the state government was unhappy with the Commonwealth Government's actions, suspecting them of being politically motivated before an election.
"
ICompound cyanuric ne-melamine umazihlanganiswa nomchamo wekati kuphume ube yini umphumela?,"The correct answer is **C: Amakristalu**.

"

The passage states that South Africa ""looked like they would falter"" against their southern sisters, implying their play at the beginning wasn't particularly amazing, and they only improved as the tournament went on. The other options were highlighted as strengths in their game.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, umdlalo weNingizimu Afrika uqale nini ukuthuthuka?","The correct answer is **D: Njengoba umqhudelwano bewuqhubeka** (As the tournament progressed).

The passage states: ""iNingizimu Afrika nokho yaya ngokuya ithuthuka njengoba umncintiswano uqhubeka."" This directly translates to South Africa gradually improved as the tournament progressed.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okunga vezi okuqondile ngomnotho waseChina?","The correct answer is **D: I-China ayikaze yambisa izimoto phesheya ukudlula i-Germany**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Umnotho waseChina ukhule ngendlela emangazayo njengoba benza ushintsho:** This is supported by the passage (""ubukhulu bomnotho waseShayina buye bakhula izikhathi eziphindwe ngo-90"")

*   **B: I-China inemakethe enkulu yokuhambisa izimoto phesheya kune United States:** This is directly stated (""yadlula iMelika njengemakethe enkulu kunazo zonke yalemboni"")

*   **C: I-China ingaba neGDP enkulu kudlula i-United States:** This is directly stated (""I-GDP yaseShayina ingaba nkulu kuneyaseMelika emashumini amabili eminyaka"")

*   **D: I-China ayikaze yambisa izimoto phesheya ukudlula i-Germany:** The passage states, ""ngonyaka odlule iShayina ithumele izimoto eziningi kwamanye amazwe kuneJalimane"". Therefore, this option is incorrect."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, i-GDP yeChina ingayidlula nini i-GDP yase United States?","The correct answer is **B: Phakathi neshumi leminyaka amabili**

The passage states: ""I-GDP yaseShayina ingaba nkulu kuneyaseMelika emashumini amabili eminyaka."" (China's GDP may be larger than that of the United States in two decades). Therefore, ""emashumini amabili eminyaka"" translates to ""ishumi leminyaka amabili"".
"
U-Hu wanikeza kuphi ukwazisa kwamazwe asethuthukile?,"The correct answer is **D: Balekela izindlela zakudala zokungcolisa**.

The passage states: ""UHu ukhuthaze amazwe athuthukayo """"ukugwema indlela yakudala yokugcolisa kuqala bese uhlanza kamuva."""" "" This directly translates to Hu encouraging developing countries to avoid the old way of polluting first and cleaning up later. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.
"
Yini engakhulunywanga ngoHu?,"The correct answer is **D: Inani lokususwa kwamakhaboni**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Isisekelo sokusikwa** Hu akalishongo ngqo inani lesehlukaniso, ethi lizokwenziwa ngokuya ngomphumela wezomnotho waseShayina.
*   **B: Iseluleko kumazwe asathuthuka ngendaba yokungcola** UHu ukhuthaze amazwe asathuthuka ""ukugwema indlela yakudala yokungcolisa kuqala bese uhlanza kamuva"".
*   **C: Usuku lapho ngethemba ukukhishwa kwekhabhoni azosuswa khona** Ayikho imininingwane yokususwa kwamakhaboni evezwe nguHu.
*   **D: Inani lokususwa kwamakhaboni** UHu akazange asho inani lokukhishwa kwamakhaboni, kusekho ithuba lokusisusa.

Therefore, the passage does not explicitly mention the carbon removal amount."
Yikuphi okulandelayo uVeerman wathi isimo sakho sibi?,"The correct answer is **B: i-Angola**.

The quote from the passage is: ""I-Angola izobhekana nobhubhane olukhulu futhi isimo siqhubeka sisibi e-Angola,"" washo. (Richard Veerman said: ""Angola is facing a major epidemic and the situation continues to worsen in Angola."")

So, Veerman stated that the situation is worsening in Angola.

Abadlali bakhuza isizalela ukuba zenzeni njesikhathi kuzodlala i-opera yeCamille Saint-Saens?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukuhlanganyela ekusebenziseni i-cannabis**.

The passage states that the theater itself encouraged the audience to participate, referencing the cannabis use happening on stage. Therefore, option A is the most direct and accurate answer.
"
Ubani obhema instango ngesikhathi se-opera?,"The correct answer is **C: Abadlali (Abaculi)**.

The passage states that ""abaculi babhema insangu ye-cannabis esiteji,"" which translates to ""the performers/actors smoked cannabis on stage.""
"
Iliphi elinye igama le- “spacewalk” lelo uLeonov alidlalile?,"The correct answer is **C: Umsebenzi owenziwa e-space**.

The passage states: ""NgoMashi-18, 1965, wenze umsebenzi wokuqala wangaphandle kwenqola-mkhathi (i-EVA), noma """"ukuhamba emkhathini"""",..."". This clearly indicates that ""ukuhamba emkhathini"" (spacewalk) is also known as ""umsebenzi owenziwa e-space"".
"
ULeonov wahola yiphi inxenye ye-Soviet yempi?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**

The passage states that Gibson was taken to the hospital after the accident but died soon after. The truck driver was unharmed, and there's no indication the children or garage worker were injured, only that they were witnesses.
"
Kwenzekeni ngabantu ebebahilele engozini?,"The correct answer is **B: Oyedwa walimala, oyedwa washona**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""uGibson wayiswa esibhedlela kodwa washona ngokushesha ngemva kwalokho"" (Gibson was taken to the hospital but died soon after). This indicates Gibson died.
*   The passage also states: ""Umshayeli weloli, oneminyaka engu-64, akalimalanga ekunqubuzaneni"" (The truck driver, age 64, was not injured in the collision). This indicates the truck driver was not injured.

Therefore, one person died (Gibson) and one person was uninjured (the truck driver), which means one person was injured (in the sense that they sustained fatal injuries) and one person died. So, option B is the most accurate. The children who were waiting to cross the road were witnesses and not directly involved in the accident as victims.
"
Abososayensi bebesenza kuhlelo elithi benethemba lokuqaphela okuyimbangela yaziphi izinto ezilandelayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Amandla adonsela phansi**.

Umusho ukhuluma ngokugxekwa kokusebenzisa imali okukhulu kanye nokuklomelisa abathile ngokwakha, kodwa awukhulumi ngokugxekwa kokuntula imizamo yokwakha. Empeleni, impikiswano yenzeka ngokuchitha imali eningi nokuthi imali isetshenziswe kanjani.
"

The passage states that the company hopes to expand its business and be liked in areas where Skype is strong, which implies that Skype was acquired by eBay.
"
I-eBay izama ukufeza ini ngalokho ekuzuzile?,"The most accurate answer is **B: Ukukhulisa ezindaweni ezintsha**.

The passage explicitly states that eBay hopes to expand its business and gain popularity in regions where Skype has a strong presence (China, Eastern Europe, Brazil). This directly implies growth in new areas.

While the other options could be potential indirect results, option B is the primary and most evident goal stated in the text.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani ongazange akhulumisane neziboshwa ezasala endaweni yokulwa?","The correct answer is **D: Abasebenzi bezibhedlela**.

Here's why:

*   **Abaxoxisani (A):** The passage explicitly states that negotiators attempted to resolve the situation.
*   **Amaqembu wokuhlenga umlilo (B):** The passage says that firefighters extinguished the fire, implying their presence and interaction with the area.
*   **Izikhulu zamaphoyisa (C):** The passage mentions officials in riot gear entering the yard and using tear gas, implying their involvement.
*   **Abasebenzi bezibhedlela (D):** The passage only mentions that injured individuals were sent to the hospital, implying that the hospital staff was not present during the riot.
"
Yikuphi okulandelayo okwabangela ukuba iziboshwa zingasaqubeki nesiteleka?,"The correct answer is **B: Isisi esikhalisa izinyembezi**.

The passage states that after negotiations failed, officials in riot gear entered the yard and subdued the inmates with tear gas. This directly led to the end of the protest.
"
"Ngokombono ka-Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, izwe i-Iran kumelwe izikhulule kuphi?","The correct answer is **D: Ukuzimel kuka-owela**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Umbusi ophakeme wezwe, u-Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, uchaze ukuncika kuwoyela """"njengesicupho""""...futhi lokho izwe okumelwe lizikhulule kukho."" This directly links Khamenei's view to dependence on oil."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani owavuma imiphumela yesixwayiso kumnotho yeIran?","The correct answer is **A: Imithombo ephezulu**.

The passage states: ""Ukuphawula, okwenzeka ngaleso sikhathi kuthelevishini, bekungokokuqala lapho **imithombo emikhulu yase-Iran** ivume ukuthi ukujezisa kunethonya elithile."" (The commentary, which happened on television at the time, was the first time that **major Iranian sources** admitted that sanctions had some effect.)
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungekona indlela yokuvota kweFrance?,"The correct answer is **D: Amavoti abalwe abameli bamakhandidethi**.

The passage states: ""...abavoti bazihlukanisa bodwa ebhokisini, babeka iphepha eliphrintiwe ekuqaleni elibonisa ukhetho lwabo ngaphakathi kwemvilophi."" This clearly indicates that voters mark their choice on a pre-printed slip of paper.

"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, uAllen usebenzisa imali enengi kuphi?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuhlola ezolwandle** (Marine exploration).

The passage states that Allen ""reportedly invested a large fortune in marine exploration"". While the search for Musashi is part of that exploration, the exploration itself is the broader category where Allen is spending his money.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okwholela ekutheni isakhiwo sibe yingozi nangaphandle?","The correct answer is **B: Radioactive caesium**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions the detection of ""radioactive caesium and iodine"" at the site. This indicates that radioactive materials, known to be harmful, have been released into the environment.

While iodine is also mentioned, caesium is generally a longer-lived and more concerning radioactive contaminant in nuclear accidents. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uranium fuel:** The uranium fuel is a potential *source* of the radioactive contamination, but the detected *radioactive caesium* is the actual contaminant found outside the facility.

*   **C: White smoke:** White smoke, while concerning, doesn't necessarily indicate radioactivity. It could be due to other chemical reactions or combustion.

*   **D: Iodine:** While radioactive iodine is dangerous, the question asks which one the building believe is dangerous outside the building, and the radioactive caesium mentioned has a longer life."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungekona icebo lezokuphepha elinikezwe abantu bendawo mayelana nalokho okwenzeke esakhiweni?,"The correct answer is **C: Kubalekela ukuphefumula intuthu emhlophe**.

The passage states:

*   Authorities warned residents to **stay indoors**
*   Authorities warned residents to **turn off air conditioners**
*   Authorities warned residents to **not drink tap water**

The passage does not mention avoiding breathing the white smoke. Therefore, that is NOT a safety instruction given to the local people.

"
I-NextGen izuzisa kanjani ngokuqondile ukulawula umoya we-traffic?,"While all the options are indirectly related to the benefits of NextGen, the passage *directly* states how it benefits air traffic control:

*   **B: Izindawo zokundiza ezicacile** - The passage states NextGen uses ""satellite-based technology rather than older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information."" This directly describes a benefit to air traffic control.

Therefore, the best answer is **B**.
"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Historians criticized the FBI for focusing on *easy-to-solve crimes like car theft* to inflate their success rates. It ALSO states that Congress directed the FBI to allocate 10 personnel to *adult pornography* cases.

* **The question asks:** What did historians *NOT* criticize the FBI for focusing on?

While historians criticized the focus on easy cases like car theft (making D incorrect), and the passage details a new focus on child pornography due to congressional directive (making C the best answer since the question specifically asks what historians did NOT criticize).
"
Isinyathelo sokuziphatha okungadingekile kuphoqelele i-FBI ukuba yenzeni?,"The correct answer is **D: Sinikela ngamaphoyisa ezindabeni zezithombe ezingcolile**

The passage states that Congress mandated the FBI to dedicate 10 staff members to adult pornography cases. This directly translates to dedicating officers to pornography matters.

The passage states that Brzezinski took over as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, ""ethatha isikhundla sikaHenry Kissinger"". This means Kissinger held the position before Brzezinski.
"

The passage explicitly states he scored 403 goals in 468 games. Option A contradicts this fact by saying he scored *more* than 468 goals. The other options are directly supported by the text.
"
Yisiphi isitatimende esiyiqiniso esikhuluma ngomlando kaBobek ne-Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukuqale ukudlalela i-Partizan ngo-1945**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""Ubajoyine ngo-1945 futhi wahlala kwaze kwaba u-1958,"" which directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Udlalele iZagreb ngaphambi kwe-Partizan Belgrade** - The passage only mentions he was born in the capital of Croatia, not that he played for Zagreb.
*   **C: Udlalele iPartizan kufikela ku-1995** - The passage states he played for Partizan until 1958.
*   **D: Wathola udumo ngemva kokuvotelwa njengomdlali ohamba phambili kunabo bonke wePartizan** - The passage says he gained fame while playing for Partizan, and then much later was voted the best player. The order is the reverse."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iziphi izici ezihlukanisa iHesperonychus ku-Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **B: Beyine zipho elikhulu lesibili**.

The passage specifically mentions that the Hesperonychus was named ""Hesperonychus"" which means ""western claw"" because of its larger second toe claw, implying this is a distinguishing feature.

The passage mentions that it is a member of the Dromaesauridae family, which is related to the Velociraptor. Because of this, it may be possible that they have some similar traits, like 
*   walking on two feet
*   a full coat of feathers
*   being warm blooded"
Isizathu esichaza i- “Hesperonychus” lithathelwa kusiphi isici salesi silwane?,"The correct answer is **A: Izinzipho(inzipho)**.

"
Ikuphi okulandeyo okuyiniqiniso mayelana nokudubula?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukudubula kwenzeka eBuffalo**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""izabe seziza e-Buffalo ukuzobungaza kanye nabangane nezihlobo"" (they then came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and family) and ""Umyeni oneminyaka engu-30, owazalelwa eNyathi, wayengomunye wabane oshonile ngenkathi kudutshulwa"" (The 30-year-old husband, who was born in Buffalo, was one of the four who died in the shooting.)
* **A** is incorrect because only the wedding took place in Texas, not both the husband and wife.
* **B** is incorrect because there were 4 victims, not 5.
* **C** is incorrect because they got married the previous year in Texas and not before Buffalo."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuyiqiniso mayelana nokuthi ukudutshulwa kwenzeke kuphi?,"The correct answer is **B: Kwenzeke emcimbini ohlelekile wokugubha isikhumbuzo.**

The passage explicitly states that the anniversary event was ""scheduled for a later date"" and that the shooting happened at the anniversary celebration.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini into eyinhloko ebeyikhathaza izikhulu mayelana neLuno?","The correct answer is **C: Ukuchitheka kopethiloli** (Oil spill).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ekuqaleni iziphathimandla zazesaba ukuthi umkhumbi ungachitha umthwalo"" which suggests authorities were afraid that the ship would spill its load. The passage mentions that the ship was carrying ""umquba,"" or fertilizer. The other relevant piece of information is ""I-Luno ibinamamitha aphindwe kathathu kaphethiloli angu-120-160.""

Therefore, while the other options might be relevant considerations, the primary concern expressed in the passage is the potential for an oil spill.
"
"Ngokuya kwawlomusho, ikuphi okulandelayo okukhuluma ngemvelaphi yeLuno okungelona iqiniso?","Impendulo efanele ngu **B: Umkhumbi bewune pethiloli okungaba ama-metre angu-100 ngesikhathi siphuka.**

The passage states, ""Isibonakaliso besingalimanga ngokoqobo"" which translates to ""The sign was not damaged physically."" This means the suspect did *not* physically damage the sign.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shintsha okukodwa emagameni:** The passage says that the 'O' was changed to 'e', indicating that a change was made.
*   **B: Ihlobise ngopawu lokuthula:** The passage says the sign was decorated with peace signs, so the suspect *did* decorate with peace signs.
*   **D: Sebenzisa i-tarpaulins ukuze uyithuthukise:** The passage mentions the use of tarpaulins to change the 'O' to 'e', so the suspect *did* use tarpaulins.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the photographers were initially hostages but were later released and replaced by an elderly woman. Therefore, they were not hostages at the end of the incident.

2.  Wind starts (shortly after the show starts)
3.  Wind reaches 70km/h
4.  Heavy, painful rain starts

"

The passage states ""Amafu amnyama angahlobene nokuqhuma kwentabamlilo abikiwe esiqwini sentaba. Amafu enze kwaba nokudideka kokuthi ukuqubuka kube khona yini.""

*   **D: Amakhethini wemiyane** - The passage clearly says millions of mosquito nets are being distributed.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B, C, and D**."
Isifo sidlulela kanjani ebantwini?,"Impendulo efanele ngu **C: Izingulube**.

Umbhalo uthi ""Lesi sifo sitholakala ezingulubeni, esidlulela ebantwini ngominyane.""
"
Ukuhluleka komusho wesibili kungaholela kumuphi umphumela?,"Impendulo efanele ngu **B: Amalungelo wakusasa wobulili obufanayo agunyazwa inyunyana yabantu**.

This means the sentence was removed by the House of Representatives and then passed by the Senate on Monday.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Ngomsombuluko** (Monday).
"
Yaphumela kubani ngokungemthetho i“Panama Papers”?,"The correct answer is **A: Inkampani kaMossack Fonseca**.

While the other options are related to the Panama Papers scandal, the question asks *who* leaked the documents. The passage states that the documents came *from* Mossack Fonseca, implying they were the source of the leak, regardless of who physically released them.
"

"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungekona isizathu sokuba inengi lezingozi zendiza zenzeka e-Iran?,"The correct answer is **A: Uquqaba lwezindiza zempi zakudala**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:**
    *   Many old, poorly maintained planes are used for both civilian and military purposes.
    *   Sanctions prevent the purchase of new aircraft.

*   **The passage implies:**
    *   Poor maintenance is a contributing factor to accidents.

*   **Analyzing the options:**
    *   **A:** While the passage mentions old military planes, it doesn't explicitly state that a ""multitude"" of them is the *main* reason for accidents. The emphasis is on the age and poor maintenance of *all* planes (civilian and military).
    *   **B:** The passage clearly states that sanctions prevent buying new planes, which contributes to the problem.
    *   **C:** The passage explicitly talks about the sanctions preventing the purchase of new aircraft
    *   **D:** The passage directly mentions that the planes are poorly maintained.

Therefore, option A is the one aspect not mentioned."
Ikuphi okungabikwanga kureport okuvela kuIraq Study Group?,"The correct answer is **B: Umthetho enoshintsho, ubudlova obukhona e-Iraq bungaqedwa**.

The passage states that the Iraq Study Group warns that *no one* can guarantee any course of action will end sectarian war, escalating violence, or a slide into chaos. Therefore, the report doesn't claim a change in course will eliminate violence. The other options are all mentioned in the text.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okunganxuswanga i-Iraq Study Group?,"Based on the provided text, the Iraq Study Group did NOT advocate for:

*   **A: Ukuqinisekiswa besivumelwano sokuyela ubudlova (Assurance of a violence agreement)**

"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungekona imiklomelo kaHitoshi Saito?,"The correct answer is **D: Onolwazi njeJudo**.

The passage mentions that Saito was a gold medalist at the Olympics, chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation training committee, and a medalist in the World Games, implying he was a world champion. The passage does not mention that he was just knowledgeable in Judo.

"
Umjaho uwumise nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngemva kokuthi uSchumacher aqede umdlalo wakhe.**

The passage states that Schumacher finished his race soon after Alonso. Alonso's problem, potentially a poorly fitted front wheel, ended his race shortly after a pit stop. Therefore, the race was stopped after Schumacher finished.
"

The passage states that Michael Schumacher ended his race early due to damage to the suspension.
"
"Ngokuya walomusho, ubani okumelwe akhiphe ama-bail wabantu ababoshiwe?","The correct answer is **D: Ukhomishani was-court**.

"Ngokuya kokubamba isigebengu okwesikhashaba,ikuphi ababoshiwe okumelwe babe nakho ukuze bavunyelwe bagedwe amahora angu24?","The correct answer is **D: Ukuyolalela icala**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states a restraining order was issued to force the release of those held for over 24 hours *without a court commissioner arraigning them*.
*   The commissioner is responsible for setting bail (if applicable) and *formalizing the charges* through arraignment.

Therefore, the key to being released is having the arraignment hearing."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, isiphi isizathu esingachazwanga mayelana nokususwa kwe-runoff?","The passage states two reasons for canceling the runoff election:

1.  **The cost** to the Afghan people.
2.  **The security risks** to the Afghan people.

The passage also mentions that ambassadors found enough ambiguity in the Afghan constitution to determine a runoff wasn't necessary.

Therefore, the best answer is **D: Ukungaqondakali okukhona emthethweni (The ambiguity existing in the law)**. While security risks and high costs are mentioned, the question asks for the *uncharacterized* reason. The passage does not elaborate on the ambiguity of the law, only stating it as the reason ambassadors came to that conclusion.
"
Kungani amanxusa agcizelela ukungabi nasidingo kwe-runoff?,"The passage states: ""Amanxusa athe athole ukungacaci okwanele emthethweni-sisekelo wase-Afghanistan ukunquma ukuthi ukhetho oluqhubekayo aludingeki."" This translates to ""Ambassadors said they found enough ambiguity in the Afghan constitution to determine that a runoff election was not needed.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Bekunokuphikisana phakathi emthethweni (There was ambiguity within the constitution)**
"
Ubani onikela iFATA isevisi yokwahlulela?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **B: Abasebenzi bezepolotiki**.

The passage states that ""Abaphatheli Bombusazwe"" are responsible for providing governmental and judicial services within FATA. ""Abaphatheli Bombusazwe"" can be translated to ""Political Agents"".
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungelona iqiniso “Ngabasebenzi besePolotiki yeFATA?,"The correct answer is **C: Balandela ngokuqophelela umthetho wasePakistani**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the ""Political Agents"" govern FATA under Regulation 247 of the Pakistani constitution. Therefore we can conclude they don't necessarily abide by regular Pakistani Law, and their power comes from their specific regulation of the constitution.
*   The passage directly states that Political Agents provide judicial services (A).
*   The passage directly states that they are appointed by the President of Pakistan (B).
*   The passage states that they have near-absolute control in those areas (D)."

Yiziphi izinto ezilandelayo ezaqhubeka zisebenza ngemva kokuzamazama komhlaba?,"The correct answer is **A: Yonke imishini esembonini eseHokuriku**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""I-NHK ibike nokuthi isifunda sesikhungo samandla wenuzi iKashiwazaki Karawa eNiigata besisebenza ngokuvamile."" This implies that the nuclear power plant in Niigata was operating normally, and Hokuriku electric power ayibikanga ukuthinteka.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **B: Isikhumulo sezindiza e-Ishikawa:** The passage says ""neSikhumulo Sezindiza saseNoto sasesifundazweni sase-Ishikawa sisavaliwe"" (Noto Airport in Ishikawa prefecture is closed). Therefore, this is incorrect.
*   **C: Bonke ojantshi abahamba izitimela:** The passage says ""izinkonzo zesitimela ziphazamisekile ezindaweni ezithintekile"" (train services were disrupted in the affected areas). This means not all train lines were functioning, so this is incorrect.
*   **D: Imboni yamakhemikhali eseNiigata:** The passage doesn't mention anything about chemical industries in Niigata. The passage does state that ""I-NHK ibike nokuthi isifunda sesikhungo samandla wenuzi iKashiwazaki Karawa eNiigata besisebenza ngokuvamile."" This implies that the nuclear power plant in Niigata was operating normally, and Hokuriku electric power ayibikanga ukuthinteka. Therefore, this is incorrect."
"Ngokwendaba, yiziphi izinto ezilandelayo ezilimele ngenxa yokuzamazama komhlaba?","The correct answers are:

*   **A: Amanye amakhaya** (Some homes) - The passage mentions that about 9400 homes are without water and about 100 are without electricity.

*   **D: Isikhumbulo Sezindiza EsiseNoto** (Noto Airport) - The passage mentions that Noto Airport in Ishikawa Prefecture is closed.

Option B is incorrect because it mentions ""imishini emibili kwezempi eShika"" (two military devices in Shika), which is not mentioned in the passage. The passage mentions ""isiphehli Nombolo 1 no-2 esikhungweni sayo samandla enuzi zivaliwe"" (Reactor Number 1 and 2 at its nuclear power plant were shut down). It does not mention military devices.
"
"Ngokwendaba, iziphi izinkinga ezingafakwanga kuyidokhuyumenti?","The correct answer is **B: Imbangela yempi yango-1967**.

"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungekho phakathi kwezinto ezifunwa yiPalestine?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuqhubeka nokuba khona kwezempi eSigodini SaseJordan**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Israel wants a military presence in the Jordan Valley. The Palestine Authority (PA) wants it to end after 5 years.
*   So, the continuation of a military presence is an Israeli demand, not a Palestinian one.
*   Palestina ifuna isekelwe emingceleni ngaphambi kweMpi yaseMpumalanga eMaphakathi yango-1967.
*   Inkinga Yesigodi saseJordani. I-PA ivuma ukuba amasosha abe khona iminyaka eyisihlanu kuphela.

The other options are things the passage implies the Palestinians want:
*   A: Imingcele esekelwe ezimweni ezingaphambi kwempi
*   C: Izimpendulo ngokuphathelene neSigodi SaseJordan
*   D: Unyaka wesihlanu kukhona ezempi eSigodini SaseJordan"

"
"Njengoba kubonisiwe kule ndaba, uCarolyn Wilson wasebenzela ubani ngaphambi kokuhamba edolobheni?","The correct answer is **C: I-OHA**.

* **This directly implies that AOL's user base will face competition** from Yahoo! and Microsoft, making option C the most logical consequence.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungase kuphele kulandela isivumelwano esisha?,"The passage states that ""With the operation of this provision, freedom may end.""  It then explains that Yahoo! and Microsoft combined will have more customers than AOL.  This implies that AOL's freedom to innovate and dominate the IM market will be curtailed due to increased competition.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Inkululeko ye-AOL yokuthuthukisa ezokudayisa ngendlela ethanda ngayo** (AOL's freedom to innovate in marketing as it pleases).
"
Bangaki abantu ababulawa ngesikhathi kuhlaselwa ababengewona amaphoyisa?,"Impendulo efanele ngu **C: 0**

Umbhalo uthi amaphoyisa amabili abulewe kanti abangu-19 abalimele ngamaphoyisa. Ngakho, akekho umuntu ongazange abe yiphoyisa obulewe kulokhu kuhlasela.

The passage states: ""Njengoba owina lesi sifunda ethatha konke, iFlorida inklomelise uRomney ngazo zonke izihambeli zayo ezingu-50..."" So, because of the winner-take-all nature of the Florida primary, Romney won all of the state's delegates. The passage further states that Florida awarded Romney all 50 of its delegates. Although the passage uses ""50"", the answer still clearly follows.
"
"Ngokwendaba, uGingrich wathola amaphesenti amangaki amavoti okhethweni lokuqala?","The correct answer is **B: Amaphesenti angu-32**

"

*   **A: Emjahweni wesibili, uCarpenado waqeda ngaphambi komtshuzi waseHungary** - The text states Carpenado finished 10th and Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary finished 9th. Therefore, Carpenado finished *behind* the Hungarian skier. This statement is incorrect.

*   **B: Abatshuzi abangu-45 abazange baqede umjaho wabo kuyiGiant Slalom** - The text states ""45 kwabangu-117 abashushuluza eqhweni eSlalom eNkulu bahluleke ukuthola izikhundla emjahweni."" This means 45 failed to complete the race. This statement is correct.

*   **C: Abatshuzi abaningi bayiqeda iGiant Slalom kuneSlalom** - For Giant Slalom, 117 started, and 45 did not finish. Therefore 117-45=72 finished. For Slalom, 116 started and 36 did not finish. Therefore 116-36=80 finished. So, more skiers finished the Slalom than the Giant Slalom. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.

*   **D: UCarpenado walala indawo yeshumi kuyiSlalom** - The text states Carpanedo ""Engaqedanga khona umncintiswano wakhe wokuqala"" in Slalom. Therefore this statement is incorrect.

**Therefore, the correct answer is B.**

The passage states: ""INorthern Rock icele ukusekelwa ngenxa yokuchayeka kwayo phakathi nenhlekelele yesikweletu esibi sezindlu ngo-2007."" This directly links the need for government support to the subprime mortgage crisis.
"
"Ngokwendaba, isiphi isitatimende esilandelayo esikuchaza ngokunembile ukusebenzelana kweVirgin Group kanye nebhange iNorthern Rock?","The correct answer is **B: IVirgin Group yathenga ibhange ngaphambi kokuba lisetshenziswe yizwe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""I-Virgin Group kaMnumzane - Richard Branson yayinebhidi yebhange eyanqatshelwa ngaphambili kokuba leli bhange libe elezwe."" This directly indicates that Virgin Group made a bid *before* the bank was nationalized.
* The passage states that Virgin bought the 'good bank' after nationalisation, not before."
"Njengoba kubonisiwe kule ndaba, yiliphi izwe elathintwa ukusayinwa kweKyoto mayelana nesimo sezulu?","The correct answer is **C: Australia**.

The passage states that the Australian conservative government refused to ratify Kyoto, but Mr. Rudd signed it. This shows Australia was directly affected by the decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol.  The passage also mentions the US, India and China in relation to the protocol, but does not say that they were impacted by the signing of Kyoto."
Uhulumeni wangaphambili wase-Australia ucabanga ukuthi ukuqinisekiswa kwe-Kyoto kuzobangela ukulimala kwani?,"The correct answer is **B: Kwezomnotho kwezwe**.

The passage states: ""Uhulumeni wase-Australia odla ngoludala wenqabe ukuvumela iKyoto, uthi izolimaza umnotho...""

This directly supports option B. The other options are either not mentioned as being damaged or refer to specific elements that contribute to the overall economic impact.

The passage states: ""Ngokubambisana neNPWS kanye neSporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, amavolontiya afanelekayo abuthwa, ngaphansi **kohlelo lokuzingela lweSporting Shooters Association**."" This directly indicates that the volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
"
Yisiphi isitatimende ezingabonisi ukunemba kokuhlola kwendlela yokubulala izinambuzane?,"The statement that does NOT reflect the accuracy of the evaluation of the pest extermination method is **A: Njengoba kwakuwukuhlola kokuqala kohlelo, akuzange kuhlolisiswe.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the trial was **monitored** and its **success assessed** ( ""Abadubuli esilingweni sokususa izilwane ezihluphayo bekufanele babekwe iso abaphathi bendawo, njengoba isilingo besiqashelwe futhi impumelelo yaso ihlolwa.""). This directly contradicts option A, which claims it wasn't rigorously checked.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   **B: Abadubuli bathola iziqondiso zokuqeqesha:** The passage states the shooters received ""comprehensive safety training and training"".
*   **C: Abadubuli babegadwe umuntu oqaphile:** The passage starts off by saying ""Abadubuli esilingweni sokususa izilwane ezihluphayo bekufanele babekwe iso abaphathi bendawo"".
*   **D: Kwakhetha abadubuli abane:** The passage states ""abadubuli abane abakhethwe ohlelweni lokudubula bathola ukuqeqeshwa okujulile"".

Therefore, the correct answer is **A**."
"Ngokwendaba, kwatholakala kuphi ukwehlukana?","The correct answer is **A: EsiGodini saseRift**.

The quote states that the researcher is with the Rift Valley Research Service in Ethiopia, and that the discovery leading to the conclusion about an earlier split was based on ""lomvubukulo"" (archaeology/fossils).
"
"Ngokwendaba, yini eyenzeka ngokushesha kunangesikhathi esilindelekile?","The correct answer is **B: Ukwehlukana (The Split)**.

The passage states: ""Ngokusekelwe kulomvubukulo, lokhu kusho ukuthi **ukuhlukana okwangaphambili kakhulu** kunalokho okwakusikiselwa ubufakazi bamangqamuzana."" (Based on this fossil discovery, this means that **the split happened earlier** than what molecular evidence suggested).

This directly indicates that the split happened earlier than previously believed.
"
Yini umdlali azodinga ukuyenza ukuze asebenzise ngezandla umdlalo wevidiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Hambisa into oqondisa ngayo emoyeni**.

The passage states: ""...lokhu kuzovumela abadlali ukuba balawule izenzo nokunyakaza emdlalweni wevidiyo ngokunyakazisa isisetshenziswa emoyeni."" (This will allow players to control actions and movements in the video game by moving the device in the air.)
"

The latest reports, according to the prompt, say the plane was diverted back to Afghanistan and landed in Kandahar. The earlier reports stated the plane was diverted because it was denied an emergency landing in Ürümqi. If it landed in Kandahar after being diverted back to Afghanistan, it did *not* land in Ürümqi.
"
Yini engashiwongo embikweni wokuqala ovela kuyi-enjensi yezindaba zaseXinhau?,"The correct answer is **D: Ibhanoyi lithole izinsongo zokuthi kunebhomu**.

The first report from Xinhua mentioned a hijacking and the diversion to Afghanistan. Later reports added the bomb threat. Therefore, the bomb threat was not in the initial report.
"
"Phakathi nohlelo lwasemsakazweni, yini eyamenyezelwa uSara Danius?","The correct answer is **D: Ikomiti lizoyeka ukuxhumana noBob Dylan**.

"
Ubani owaphawula mayelana nesithembiso “sesinyathelo esikhulu”?,"The correct answer is **C: U-Gordon Johndroe**.

The text states that ""Umkhulumeli kaBush uGordon Johndroe ubize isithembiso seNyakatho Korea """"ngesinyathelo esiyinhloko..."""" (Bush's spokesperson Gordon Johndroe called North Korea's promise ""a major step..."").
"
USłania wakhiqiza izitembu ezingaki emazweni ahlukahlukene?,"The correct answer is **A: Ezingaphezu kuka-2,000**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Ngo 1956 u-Słania made ""izingaphezu kuka-1,000"" (more than 1,000) izitembu (stamps) for Sweden and izingu-28 (28) for other countries. This clearly indicates he made more than 1,000+ 28 which equal more than 1028 which is more than two thousand.

"
"Ngokwendaba, yini engase ibe imbangela yokuvuza kwamathangi okungenisa nokukhipha umoya?","The correct answer is **A: Indawo yesibili egcwaliswa ngomthamo**.

The passage states: ""Kusukela ngoLwesithathu emini, ama-tank vent ayesavuza cishe ngenxa yokwanda kwamanzi okubangelwa ukushisa phakathi kwethangi."" This clearly indicates that thermal expansion within the tank, leading to its filling to capacity and beyond, is the likely cause of the vents leaking.
"
Kungani avuleka amavalvu akhululayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Kwaba nenkinga yamandla ngemva kokuba kuhloliwe**.

The passage states: ""Ukungabi khona kukagesi ngemva kokuhlolwa okuvamile kohlelo lwezicima-mlilo lubangele umgudu wokufutha ukuba uvuleke futhi uwoyela ongahluziwe wachitheka eduza nesiteshi sokumpompa 9. Ukuvuleka kwamavalvu kuvumela ukuphuma komoya ohlelweni"".  This directly links the power failure to the opening of the relief valves.
"

The passage states that scientists hope to understand how planets formed, ""ikakhulukazi indlela uMhlaba owakheke ngayo"" (especially how the Earth formed), by studying meteorites.
"
"Ngokwendaba, iyiphi indima amaphoyisa endawo ayidlala ekuvaleni?","The correct answer is **C: Aqondisa abashayela izimoto ukuba baphume ngenye indlela**.

The passage states that ""usizo lwamaphoyisa angu-80 belukhona ukuqondisa abashayeli bezimoto kwezinye izindlela"". This directly describes the police's role in redirecting traffic.
"
Kwenzekani endaweni esapayipi yokudlula phakathi nokuvalwa?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Ayevaliwe**.

The text states that trucks were used to block entrances to the *subway* (ojantshini ohamba ngaphansi komhlaba), implying the subway itself remained open. The text also says that the highway, ""enye indlela yokungena edolobheni,"" was not experiencing delays. This confirms that alternative routes (like the subway) were open.
"
"Ngokwendaba, yini engazange yenzeke ngaphambi kokuba umthwebuli wezithombe eshayiswe imoto?","The correct answer is **D: Umthwebuli wayekwazi ukuthatha isithombe sikaBieber**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the photographer was taking pictures of police at a traffic stop. The passage indicates Bieber said he wasn't involved.
*   The other options are all explicitly mentioned in the passage as events that occurred before the photographer was hit."
Yini umthwebuli wezithombe ayezama ukuyenza ngaphambi kokuba ashayiswe yimoto?,"The correct answer is **B: Washutha izithombe zalapho amaphoyisa ayevimbe khona**.

The text states: ""umthathi wezithombe wamisa imoto yakhe kolunye uhlangothi lweSepulveda Boulevard futhi wazama ukuthatha izithombe zamaphoyisa ayevimbezele...""
"
Isiphi isitatimende esingachazi ngokunembile isimo sikamongameli ngemva kokuthola ukuthi unegciwane?,"The correct answer is **A: Akazizwa kahle**.

Here's why:

*   **P** states that Arias said he felt well and was ready to work by phone. Therefore, it is inaccurate to say that he does not feel well.

The other options are all true based on the passage:

*   **B: Umphimbo wakhe ubuhlungu** - Arias admits to a sore throat.
*   **C: Isimo sakhe sizinzile** - The passage states the president's condition is stable.
*   **D: Unomkhuhlane** - The passage mentions a fever.
"
"Ngokwendaba, isiphi isitatimende kulezi ezilandelayo esiyiqiniso ngomongameli?","The correct answer is **C: Uphile ngokwanele ukuthi engaxhumana nabanye ngocingo** (He is well enough to communicate with others by telephone).

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Ngaphandle kwemfiva nomminzo obuhlungu, ngizizwa ngikahle futhi ngikulungele ukwenza umsebenzi wami ngokuxhumana ngocingo."" (""Apart from a fever and a sore throat, I feel good and am ready to do my job by telephone."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Akanawo umkhuhlane** (He does not have a fever) - The passage says ""Ngaphandle kwemfiva"" - ""Apart from fever,"" indicating he *does* have a fever.
*   **B: Uzohlala ekhaya amasonto ambalwa** (He will stay at home for a few weeks) - The passage says he will be isolated at home ""izinsukwana"" - ""for a few days.""
*   **D: Unegciwane elibi** (He has a serious virus) - The passage states, ""...uphethwe igciwane elingelibi kakhulu..."" - ""...has a virus that is not too serious.""
"
"Ngokwendaba, kwakulindeleke ukuba Isiphepho uGonu siqhubeke sidamba nini?","The correct answer is **B: Lapho umoya wehla uya kuyisivinini samakhilomitha angu-83 ngehora**.

The passage states: ""Ngasekuseni namuhla, imimoya cishe beyiku-83 km/h, futhi bekulindeleke ukuthi iqhubeke iphelelwa amandla."" This directly implies that the expectation of further weakening began when the winds reached approximately 83 km/h.
"
Wawushesha kangakanani umoya ovithondabeni lweSiphepho uGonu?,"The correct answer is **C: Angamamayela angu-149 ngehora**

The passage states ""Hurricane Gonu... had winds of 240 kilometers per hour (149 miles per hour)"". The question asks about the speed of the wind *at the height of* Hurricane Gonu.

Here's why:

*   **P: isidalwa sasolwandle sengqamuzana elilodwa** which means single-celled

The passage states that Karenia brevis is a **single-celled** marine organism. Therefore, it does *not* have multiple cells. The other options are all mentioned as characteristics of Karenia in the passage."
Yini kulokhu okulandelayo isici seKarena engakwazi ukukwenza?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is:

**B: Ukwanda ngokuphindaphinda ngesibalo ngaphansi kwanoma isiphi isimo**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Karenia brevis blooms (increases rapidly in number) when **specific environmental factors align to create favorable conditions**. This implies that it *doesn't* multiply under *any* condition, but rather requires specific circumstances.
*   The other options are directly supported by the passage:
    *   **A:** Karenia brevis produces a neurotoxin that can paralyze the nervous system in fish.
    *   **C:** Red tide can affect water.
    *   **D:** The algae produces a neurotoxin.
"
"Ngokwendaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungazange kwenzeke ngenxa yeSiphepho uFelicia?","The correct answer is **D: Izikhukhula ezisemgwaqweni**.

"
Yenzeka nini leyo ngozi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngaphambi kokuba kuphume imoto yezokuphepha**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""U-Piquet Jr. washayisa kwi- Singapore Grand Prix yango-2008... ekhipha imoto yokuphepha."" This means the crash *caused* the safety car to come out. So it must have happened *before* the safety car was deployed.
*   The passage also states that izimoto ezaziphambi kuka-Alonso ziyothela amafutha ziqondiswa imoto yokuphepha, waya phambili enkundleni futhi wathatha isicoco. The crash came before the safety car was deployed, and the safety car deployment came before Alonso's advantage.

Therefore, option C is the only logical answer."

"
Yiziphi kulezi zinto ezicwaningiwe ezingewona umphumela wocwaningo olwengeziwe?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukuqinisekisa ukuthi ama-dinosaur ayenezimpaphe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the idea that some dinosaurs had feathers was ""inkolelo-mbono ebanzi kakade"" (already a widely held belief). The research in the passage provides more detail about feather color, structure, and evolution, but it doesn't simply *confirm* that dinosaurs had feathers, as that was already understood."
Yini izimpaphe zama-dinosaur ayengenazo?,"The correct answer is **B: Into enjengomgogodla**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ngenxa yokuthi izimpaphe zama-dinosaur aziso isiqu esikhule kahle, osibizwa ngokuthi i-rachis, kodwa zinezinye izici zezimpaphe — izindlendla kanye nama-barbule — abacwaningi baphethe ngokuthi i-rachis cishe bekungukwakheka kokuziphendukela kunalezinye izici.""

This clearly indicates that dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed rachis (the shaft-like structure).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that in the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a ""baseline"" or ""comparator"" against which three other treatments were compared. Therefore, a drug target was compared to three treatments including ZMapp.
*   Option A is incorrect because the passage states that the study showed ZMapp to have less of an impact than previously thought.
*   Option C is incorrect because ZMapp was used as a baseline for comparison.
*   Option D is incorrect because it contradicts the passage, which states that ZMapp had less effect than previously thought and was used as a comparison tool in the PALM trial."
Abacwaningi bacabanga ukuthi lolu cwephe olusha lungasebenza kakhulu kuphi?,"The correct answer is **A: Emazweni lapho abantu bakhona behola imali encane.**

The passage explicitly states that the new tool could lead to faster diagnoses of diseases in ""poor countries, where survival rates for diseases like breast cancer can be half those of wealthier nations."" This directly implies that the researchers believe the tool will be most impactful in resource-limited settings.
"
Iyiphi indlela ezosetshenziswa ekwakheni ithuluzi lokwelapha?,"The correct answer is **C: Ucwecwe olungakwazi ukuprinteka**.

Here's why:

*   **P (Premise) states:** ""Lezi zigeqe zitholakale yonke indawo enyangeni..."" This directly contradicts option D, which says they haven't been found much on the lunar surface.
*   **A, B, and C** are all supported by the passage."
"Ngokwendaba, ikuphi ukusikisela mayelana nokwakheka komhlaba okubonisa ukuthi kunemisebenzi yamatshe eyenzeka enyangeni?","The correct answer is **D: Ukwakheka komhlaba kwenzeka cishe muva nje**.

"
Iyiphi inkolelo uRoberts akuxwaya ukuyiqinisekisa?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukuqala kwempilo**.

The passage states that ""URoberts wenqaba ngokuphelele ukusho ukuthi ukholelwa ukuthi impilo iqala nini..."" This directly indicates that he was unwilling to affirm his belief about when life begins.
"
Isiphi isihloko uRobert ayenomuzwa wokuthi akufaneleki ukuba kuxoxwe ngaso?,"Impendulo efanele ithi:

**D: Amacala athile**

Isitatimende esikulesi siqeshana sithi uRoberts wenqaba ukusho ukuthi ukholelwa ukuthi impilo iqala nini, ethi kuyoba ukuziphatha okungamukeleki ukuphawula ngezici ezithile zezimo ezingenzeka. Izimo ezingenzeka zibhekisela emacaleni athile.

"
Iyiphi imininingwane mayelana nokuhlasela esiqinisekiswe abezomthetho?,"The correct answer is **B: Ubuzwe bomsolwa**.

The passage states: ""...zazi ukuthi uyilungu leqembu lohlanga lwe-Uighur."" (they knew he was a member of the Uighur ethnic group).  Therefore, the ethnic origin of the suspect is confirmed.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Ukuthi ubani obebambisene naye** (Who his accomplices were) - The passage does not mention any accomplices.
*   **C: Isisusa sokuhlasela** (The motive for the attack) - The passage does not state the motive for the attack.

"Ngokwendaba, wawuyini umgomo walokho okwakuyokwenziwa emkhathini?","Based on the passage, the goal of the mission wasn't necessarily any of the provided options directly. However, the passage states that ""the station maintained its attitude...until the end of the space mission"" and that ""the normal station attitude was recovered."" This suggests that maintaining and recovering the station's attitude (orientation) was a key aspect of the mission.

Therefore, the closest and most relevant answer is:

**C: Ukuphothula umsebenzi wasemkhathini** (To complete the space mission)

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ukuthola ukuthi sikuphi nendawo:** While navigation is important, the passage focuses on the station's attitude, not its precise location.
*   **B: Ukusondela nakakhulu ekulungiseni umshini wokuqondisa okuhanjwa ngawo:** Repairing the gyroscope was a problem, but the passage highlights the *maintenance* of the attitude despite the failure, not necessarily repair being the mission goal.
*   **D: Ukusebenzisa ibhanoyi:** There's no mention of using a plane in the passage."

"
Yiziphi izitatimende ezilandelayo ezilichaza ngokunembile icala?,"Impendulo efanele ithi **D: I-AOL yaqa ukushushisa kuleli cala**.

Isitatimende sinikeza ukuthi i-AOL yinkampani eyavula icala, okusho ukuthi yaqala ukushushisa. Ezinye izinketho azilungile ngoba isitatimende asisho ukuthi i-AOL yabekwa icala, ukuthi kubandakanya abalawuli abakhulu bezinkonzo ze-inthanethi, noma ukuthi icala laqulwa ngo-2003 (ngumthetho owashaywa ngo-2003).

"
"Ngokwendaba, yini eyabangelwa ukuzamazama?","The correct answer is **B: Ukwesatshiswa itsunami**.

The passage states that even though there was no tsunami threat, residents panicked and began leaving. This indicates the earthquake *caused* the fear of a tsunami, which in turn caused their panic and evacuation.

"
"Ngokwendaba, isiphi isiqinisekiso umbusi angazange asenze lapho ekhuluma nezakhamuzi zaseTexas?","The correct answer is **D: Icala alikho bucayi**.

Here's why:

*   **P states**: ""Lolu daba lubucayi."" (This translates to ""This issue is sensitive"" or ""This case is serious"").

Therefore, the governor **did** make a statement about the seriousness of the issue, directly contradicting option D. The other options are all things the governor assured the public of in the passage."
Yimuphi umthombo wezindaba owasungulwa ababengabafundi base-UW?,"The correct answer is **D: The Onion**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Manje sinamagundane anezinyanga ezingu-4 angenawo ushukela ayenoshukela"" which translates to: ""Now we have 4-month-old mice without sugar that had sugar"". This directly indicates that some mice that previously had diabetes (sugar) no longer have it.
* The sentence 'He, like some other experts, has skepticism about whether diabetes can be cured' points to the fact that he is not confident about a cure.
* The passage also states 'This finding does not affect people with Type 1 diabetes.'

The other options are incorrect based on the information provided in the passage."
"Ngokwendaba, yini uDkt. Ur amanqikanqika ngayo?","The correct answer is **B: Uma ikhambi likhona**.

The passage states that Dr. Ur, ""like some other experts, unokungabaza ngokuthi isifo sikashukela singalashwa."" This directly translates to him being skeptical about whether a cure exists. Therefore the correct answer is B.

Yisiphi kulezi zitatimende ezingakuchazi ngokunembile lokho okwenzeka ngesikhathi kuphahlazeka indiza CG4684?,"The correct answer is **C: Indiza yazama ukuhlala phansi izikhathi ezintathu ngaphambi kokuphahlazeka.**

The passage states the plane ""beyizama ukuhlika eKokoda izolo njenge-Arlines PNG Flight CG4684, kodwa iyekile kanye kakade."" This means it attempted to land and aborted the landing *once*. The passage doesn't mention any further attempts. Therefore, option C is inaccurate.

The other options are accurate based on the text:

*   **A:** The plane initially couldn't land due to the weather (""ITwin Otter beyizama ukuhlika...kodwa iyekile kanye kakade"" - implies weather was the reason for the aborted landing).
*   **B:** The crash site was in a remote area (""Indawo yokuphahlazeka itholwe namuhla futhi akufinyeleleki kuyo kangangokuthi amaphoyisa amabili esilisa abekwa ehlathini ukuze ahambe ngezinyawo aye andaweni yesehlakalo"").
*   **D:** The search for the crash site was affected by the weather (""Ukuthungatha kuthikamezwe isimo sezulu esibi esifanayo leso esibangele ukuhlika kwendiza okunqandiwe"")."
Yini eyabangela ukuba iNdiza CG4684 ukuba ingahlali phansi?,"The correct answer is **D: Isimo sezulu sasisibi**.

The passage states: ""Ukuthungatha kuthikamezwe isimo sezulu esibi esifanayo leso esibangele ukuhlika kwendiza okunqandiwe."" This indicates the bad weather was a factor in the aborted landing.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi kulezi zitatimende ezilandelayo ezingelona iqiniso mayelana nalokho uFranciszek Kowal abhekana nakho?","The correct answer is **D: Walimala ngesikhathi ezama ukuphihliza ifasitela**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Wakwazi ukuphihliza ifasitela** - The story says that *one* window eventually broke, suggesting he didn't necessarily break it himself. So this statement could be false.
*   **B: Waphuma enganamyocu** - The first part of the quote states that nothing happened to him. So this statement is most likely true.
*   **C: Waphula isitulo ngesikhathi ezama ukuphuma** - The story mentions people hitting the glass with chairs, but does not say that *he* broke a chair. So this statement could be false.
*   **D: Walimala ngesikhathi ezama ukuphihliza ifasitela** - The quote explicitly states ""Ngenhlanhla akukho okwenzeke kimi"" which translates to ""Luckily nothing happened to me"" meaning he wasn't injured.

While A and C *could* be false, D is explicitly false based on the provided quote."
Kungani kuyinselele ukukala umonakalo ongabangelwa iSiphepho uDanielle?,"The best answer is **C: Kusekude kuqale ukuwa kwesiphepho**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Isiphepho sikude nogu, kusenzima ukubona ithuba lokuthi sigadle eMelika noma e-Caribbean."" This directly indicates that it is difficult to predict the impact of the storm because it is currently far from land.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **A: Kubikezelwa ukuthi lesi siphepho sizoba namandla kakhulu:** While the storm is predicted to strengthen, this doesn't directly explain why assessing potential damage is difficult. A powerful storm can still be far from land and therefore have uncertain impacts.
*   **B: Ososayensi abaqiniseki ngezivunguvungu eziqhubekayo:** The passage doesn't mention any uncertainty about hurricanes in general, only about the path of this specific hurricane.
*   **D: Isiphepho sibikwa ukuthi sikude kuneMiami:** While true, this is just a detail of the passage, not the reason why estimating damage is challenging. It is the distance *from any land* that makes predicting the impacts difficult."
"Ngokwendaba, yiziphi kulezi zitatimende ezilandelayo mayelana neSiphepho uDanielle esingelona iqiniso?","Based on the passage, here's why the answer is D:

*   **A: Umonakalo esizowubangela eCaribbean asaziwa:** The passage states that it is hard to know whether the hurricane will hit the Caribbean. Therefore, the damage that it will cause is unknown. This is therefore true.
*   **B: Sakhandeka Olwandle lwase-Atlantic:** The passage states that the hurricane was formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, so this is a true statement.
*   **C: Futhi singaphenduka isiphepho:** The passage mentions that the National Hurricane Center suggests that the hurricane will strengthen into a hurricane.
*   **D: Siseduzane nezwe:** The passage says that the storm is far from land (""sikude nogu""). This makes statement D false.

**Therefore, the correct answer is D.**"
"Ngokwendaba, yini okusikiselwa ukuba yenziwe ngesifo gnaphambi kokuba siphenduke ubhubhane oluthinta umhlaba wonke?","The correct answer is **A: Kufanele lungabi ingozi kakhulu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Olunye ucwaningo lukhombisa ukuthi lesi sifo kumelwe sibe nengozi yokubangela ukufa encane ngaphambi kokuthi sidale ubhubhane lomhlaba, waphawula."" This directly implies that the disease should have a low mortality rate *before* it becomes a global pandemic.

The other options are either not as strongly supported or are presented as concerns *about* the disease potentially becoming a pandemic:

*   B: While mild symptoms are a concern, the passage doesn't say they *must* be mild *before* a pandemic.
*   C: The passage doesn't say that many people *must* be infected before a pandemic.
*   D: The passage doesn't say that children *must* be symptomatic. It states the opposite, that children in Turkey were infected *without* being sick."
"Ngokwendaba, sasiqhele kangakanani isishingishane neFujian?","The correct answer is **C: Amakhilomitha angu-70**.

The passage states that the eye of Typhoon Morakot was ""cishe sibe amakhilomitha angamashumi ayisikhombisakude"" which translates to ""almost seventy kilometers away"".
"
Ubani owabingelela uGeorge W. Bush ngesikhathi efika e-Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: UWong Kan Seng kanye noHsien Loong**

The passage states that:

*   He was greeted by Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng.
*   He discussed issues with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.

Thus, both Wong Kan Seng and Lee Hsien Loong (Hsien Loong) greeted him.
"
Umengameli wakhuluma nini ngokwandiswa kwezohwebo e-Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Kulandela kokuhlulwa okhethweni oluphakathi nesikhathi sokubusa**.

The passage states: ""Ngemva kweviki lokulahlekelwa okhethweni lwaphakathi nesikhathi, uBhush watshela izilaleli ngokukhulisa ezentengiselwano e-Asia."" This clearly indicates that Bush spoke about increasing trade in Asia *after* the midterm election losses.
"
"Ngokwendaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okuwumgomo oyinhloko kahulumeni?","The correct answer is **D: Ukususa umthwalo emakalishini agcwele kakhulu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the government wants to acquire 1,300 carriages ""ukuze kuncishiswe ukubutheleka"" (to reduce overcrowding). This directly translates to relieving pressure on overcrowded carriages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukusiza amakalishi amaingi ngoMashi walo nyaka (Helping many carriages in March of this year)** - While the government made a commitment in March, the main goal is not just ""helping"" but specifically reducing overcrowding.
*   **B: Ukuthola amakalishi angu-300 (Acquiring 300 carriages)** - Getting 300 carriages is just part of the *process* of achieving the goal.
*   **C: Ukuthola amakalishi engeziwe angu-1,300 (Acquiring an additional 1,300 carriages)** - Getting 1,300 carriages is also part of the *process* of achieving the goal.

Therefore, the ultimate goal is to alleviate overcrowding in carriages."
Yini eyamenyezelwa uhulumeni?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwahlelwa ukuba kusizwe amakalishi engeziwe angu-300**.

The announcement states that the government is extending its commitment made in March to support carriages and that *an additional 300 carriages* will be funded. While related, option C is incorrect because the *additional* announced amount was 300, with the total amount being 1,300.
"
"Ngokwendaba, yikuphi ukwaziswa okwaziwayo?","The correct answer is **A: Izinga lokusongela seliye lancishiswa**.

The quote states: ""...ukuncishiswa kwezinga losongo ukuthi libe libi..."" which directly translates to the threat level being reduced. The other options are either contradicted by the text or not mentioned at all.
"
Yisiphi isitatimende mayelana nemibhikisho esingelona iqiniso?,"The correct answer is **A: Ikhomishani kamengameli yaphendula mayelana nababhikishi.**

The passage states that Martelly's response to the protests was to form a new CEP after a presidential commission recommended that the previous CEP stand down. The commission did not respond directly to the protesters; instead, their recommendation to replace the CEP was a response to the protests. The other statements are all supported by the passage.
"
Ubani owasikisela ukuba iCEP yokugcina yesule?,"Impendulo elungileyo yi **C: Ukhomishani kahulumeni**.
"
"Ngokwesitatimende, yini engasekelwa Abezokuzivocavoca base-USA kulandela ukuhlukunyezwa kwabadlali yiNassar?","The correct answer is **A: Ukunganeliseki**.

Here's why:

*   The statement explicitly says USA Gymnastics *supports* independent investigations (D), necessary change within the organization (C), and creating a safe and empowering environment (B). The opposite of that would be a condition of lack of satisfaction."
"Ngokwesitatimende, yimuphi umgomo oyinhloko kokubili Abezokuzivocavoca base-USA kanye Nekomiti Lama-Olympic Ase-United States njengoba isikhathi siqhubeka?","The correct answer is **D: Ukwenza kube nendawo ephephile yabadlali**.

The statement explicitly says: ""Ezokuzivivinya komzimba zaseMelika kanye ne-USOC zinomgomo ofanayao — ukwenza umdlalo wezokuzivivinya komzimba, kanye neminye, iphephe ngangokunokwenzeka ukuba abadlali balandele amaphupho wabo endaweni ephephile, enhle kanye nenika amandla.""
"
Umkhumbi wawuphokophele kuphi lapho kwenzeka ingozi? ,"The correct answer is **C: EPalawan**.

The passage states the ship was ""endleleni eya e e-Puerto Princesa ePalawan"" which translates to ""on the way to Puerto Princesa in Palawan"".
"
Yini engelona iqiniso mayelana nomkhumbi okukhulunywe ngawo endabeni?,"The correct answer is **B: Wawusekelwe ePalawan**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the ship was *en route* (endleleni eya) to Puerto Princesa in Palawan, meaning it wasn't based there, but was travelling there.
*   The passage explicitly states the ship was going to Puerto Princesa, is a mine countermeasure ship, and is assigned to the U.S. Navy Seventh Fleet."
Ubani owethula isitatimende mayelana nebutho lase-US?,"The correct answer is **D: Unobhala wabezindaba**.

The passage states: ""uMongameli waseMelika u-Donald Trump, esitatimendeni esikhishwe unobhala wephephandaba, umemezele ukuthi..."" which translates to ""The US President Donald Trump, in a statement released by the press secretary, announced that...""

Therefore, the press secretary released the statement.
"
"Mayelana nesitatimende, yiliphi izwe elacabanga ukuthi linomthwalo wokuqapha abalwi ababethunjiwe?","The correct answer is **D: ITurkey**.

The statement says: ""ITheki izophatha ukugada amasosha we-ISIS athunjiwe lawo, ngokwesitatimende, amazwe waseYurophu anqabe ukuwalanda."" This clearly indicates that Turkey is expected to guard the captured ISIS soldiers.
"
Kukholakala sengathi yaba yini imbangela yokuphahlazeka?,"The passage states that the crash is believed to have been caused by ""intense fire"".

Therefore the correct answer is **B: Umlilo onamandla (Intense fire)**
"

The passage explicitly states the crash happened ""phezulu endaweni enezintaba"" (high in a mountainous area).
"
Iziphathimandla zithembe ini ngenxa yezikhukhula?,"The correct answer is **D: Izindawo ezengeziwe zokuhlala kwezilwane zasendle (More areas for wildlife to inhabit)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the authorities hope the small increase in water level from the floods will be enough to revitalize eroded sandbars downstream. These sandbars and levees acted as habitat for wildlife. Therefore, they hope the floods will lead to more wildlife habitat.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okwathinta ngokuphelele ukwakhiwa kwedamu?,"The passage states that the seasonal floods were responsible for spreading sediment and creating sandbars and levees, which serve as habitat for wildlife. The dam stopped these floods. The consequence of this was the destruction of habitats which led to extinction and endangerment of certain fish species.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Indawo yokuhlala izilwane zasendle**.
"
"Ngokwendaba, ubani owanikeza i-United States ulwazi mayelana nokuhlasela okungase kwenzeke?","The correct answer is **C: Umthombo ongadalulwanga**.

I-India yalahlekelwa ama-wicket amangaki?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The passage states: ""ngemva kokuba kukhiswhe ukaputeni wayo, iNdiya yenze amaphuzu angu-36 kuphela ilahlekelwa amawikhethi angu-7 kuze kube sekugcineni kwengxenye yomdlalo."" This directly indicates that India lost 7 wickets.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ayethini amaphuzu aphakeme kulowo mdlalo?","Impendulo efanele ithi: **A: ama-run angu-70**

Le ndaba ithi uRobin Uthappa wenza ama-innings abe aphezulu kakhulu ngama-run angu-70. Nakuba kukhulunywa ngama-run angu-36 no-100, abuwona amaphuzu aphakeme kulo mdlalo ngokusho kwendaba.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungeyona imbangela yokukhungatheka kuka-Adam Cuerden?,"The correct answer is **A: Umthetho omusha engosini mayelana nezinto zocansi**

The passage explicitly states that Cuerden's frustration stems from:

*   Wales lying about the reason for the removal of art (D)
*   The removal of his artwork by Wales (B)
*   Wales pretending to listen to him (C)

There is no mention of a new policy regarding sexual content as a source of his frustration."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini eyasuswa kule ngosi?","The correct answer is **A: Ubuciko**.

The passage states: ""...kuze kube sekususweni **kobuciko bakhe**.""
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungasekelwa u-Amir Khan?","The correct answer is **A: Okuhlanganisa abalwayo babesifazane kwezama-Olympic**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Amir Khan said, ""Ekujuleni ngaphakathi ngicabanga ukuthi abantu besifazane akumelwe ukuthi balwe. Umbono wami lowo."" This clearly indicates he does not support women's boxing.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **B: Izimbangi zaseBrithani** The passage says he would support fighters *competing* with the British, so he *would* support British opponents.
*   **C: Okungakhethwa abesifazane** The passage states his opinion that ""women shouldn't fight"", which shows he *would not* support women fighting.
*   **D: Ukuzingatha ama-Olympic eLondon** The passage says he would support fighters at the Olympics in London, so he *would* support the London Olympics."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo u-Amir Khan azokweseka naphezu kwalokho yena angase akukhethe?","The correct answer is **C: Ama-Olympic ango-2012**.

The passage states that Amir Khan said he would support ""abaqophisana nabase-British emidlalweni yama-Olempikhi ayebanjelwa e-London ngo-2012"". This translates to ""British competitors in the Olympic Games held in London in 2012"".
"
Washona nini uPeter Lenz?,"The correct answer is **C: Esibhedlela**.

The passage states that Peter Lenz was taken to a local hospital where he later died.
"
Ubani uXavier Zayat?,"Impendulo efanele ithi **B: Omunye wabagijimi**.

Umbhalo ucacisa ukuthi uXavier Zayat ""ungumncintisani"" kaPeter Lenz.
"
Kukusiphi isimo lapho oshayela izindiza engazuza ekuqondeni ukusebenza kwangaphakathi kwendiza?,"The correct answer is **B: Ekwesabeni kwabo ukundiza ukuthi kumayelana nokwesaba into engaziwa**.

Here's why:

*   **Premise P** states that understanding how a plane works can help people overcome fear rooted in the unknown or lack of control.
*   **Option B** directly aligns with this by suggesting that a pilot's explanation would be beneficial when the fear stems from the unknown aspects of flying.

The other options are less relevant:

*   **Option A:** While empathy is good, a pilot's technical explanation might not directly address shame.
*   **Option C:** General fear of transportation isn't the specific issue P is addressing.
*   **Option D:** A traumatic event unrelated to flying is a different source of fear that might require different strategies."
"Mayelana nale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo umuntu ohambayo okhathazeka ngamanani okufanele akhathazeke ngakho ekugcineni?","The best answer is **C: Ukuqhathanisa amanani phakathi kwezinkampani eziningi zezokuthutha**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage emphasizes the importance of comparing prices across different sources.** It states that the same flight can have different prices depending on the ""elements included"" and that it's beneficial to compare search results and the airline's website. This directly relates to comparing prices across multiple sources.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: Ukubheka izinto ezinikezwa izinkampani zezokuthutha eziningi:** This is related, as the different ""elements"" affect the price, but the ultimate goal is to compare the final price, not just the elements.

*   **B: Ukubhuka ngokuqondile nenkampani yamabhanoyi:** While the passage mentions checking the airline's website, it doesn't suggest *only* booking directly with the airline. It just says to compare the website's price with other search results.

*   **D: Ukubheka iwebusayithi yamabhanoyi:** This is one step in the process, but not the *ultimate* concern. The purpose of checking the airline's website is to *compare* its price with others.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate reflection of the passage's central concern regarding flight prices."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini umuntu othatha uhambo okufanele ayenze kuqala ukuze athole amanani amahle endiza?","The best answer is **B: Ukuqhathanisa amanani phakathi kwezinkampani ezahlukahlukene ezikoleka imininingwane bese zenza ama-link**

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes searching and comparing prices from different aggregators (search engines) as the first step. This allows you to see a wide range of options before booking. The paragraph explains how the price of the same flight can be different depending on which travel link is used.
*   While checking the airline's website directly (A and C) is mentioned as a good idea before booking, it's presented as something to do *after* you've already searched and compared.
*   Booking through an agent (D) isn't even mentioned in the passage."
Kunini lapho umngane kudingeka aphelezele ohambisa izinto?,"The correct answer is **C: Lapho izinto zithunyelwa njengemithwalo okuzodingeka ukuba ihlolwe**.

The passage states: ""Imithetho yezinkampani zezindiza angeke ibavumele ukuthumela umthwalo ngaphandle komgibeli, okuyilapho ungena khona."" This directly implies that a passenger (like a friend) is needed when sending something as checked cargo.
"
"Ngokusekelwe kule ndaba, lapho kukhethwa Ozoshayela Njalo Indiza yiziphi izinto ezilandelayo okufanele zibe semqoka?","Based on the passage, the best answer is **D: Inkampani yezindiza engase yengeze amalungelo engeziwe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the benefits offered by frequent flyer programs can vary, suggesting that you should choose a program based on its potential to offer future benefits.
*   Option A is incorrect because the passage says that points may be redeemed differently.
*   Option B is incorrect because the passage focuses on the need to look at the details of the frequent flier program itself and not the overall alliance.
*   Option C is incorrect because the passage warns against simply choosing the airline you use most often."
"Ngokwale ndaba, ubani ongase anikeze amaphuzu okundiza amaningi?","The correct answer is **D: Inkampani ehlukile yomfelandawonye ohlukile**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that you shouldn't automatically join the frequent flyer program of the airline you use most.
*   It says that the benefits offered by these programs can vary.
*   It also indicates that points might be more advantageous on different airlines for the same fare.

Therefore, another airline within a different alliance might provide better point accumulation for the same ticket price, thus making option D the most appropriate choice."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yiziphi izinzwa ezilandelayo ezingalimala ngokuphuza kakhulu utshwala?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Ukubona** (Sight).

The passage mentions that excessive alcohol consumption, especially illegally produced alcohol containing methanol, can cause blindness.
"
"Njengoba kubonisiwe kule ndaba, yini enganciphisa ukulinyazwa utshwala?","The correct answer is **C: Ukuphuza utshwala ngezinga elifanele**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Phuza iziphuzo ezidakayo ngokulinganisela."" This implies that drinking alcohol in moderation can reduce the harm associated with alcohol consumption. The passage then contrasts this with the dangers of excessive drinking and illegally produced alcohol.
"
Yikuphi lapho emakhulu khona amanani ezindlu phakathi ne-Amsterdam?,"The correct answer is **A: EsiGodini saseCanal**.

The passage states ""amanani wezindlu aphakathi kwamanye aphezulu ezweni"" within the context of the Canal District (Grachtengordel).
"
Kungani isiGodi saseCanal sibekwe eNdaweni Yase-UNESCO World Heritage?,"The correct answer is **A: Kunamagugu ezomlando namasiko**.

The passage explicitly states the Canal District was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site ""ngenxa yesiko layo elihlukile negugu elingokomlando"" (because of its unique cultural and historical value).
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okwenza ukuvakashela iPhnom Krom kube okwanelisayo?","The passage states: ""The temple's desolate state and the viewpoint over the Tonle Sap lake make the climb worthwhile.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Indlela ebukeka ngayo indawo yaseTonle Sap** (The viewpoint over the Tonle Sap lake).
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini edingeka ezivakashini ukuze zingene ePhnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Ukuthola i-Angkor Pass**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Indawo Yokudlula yase-Angkor iyadingeka ukuze ungene ethempelini..."".
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungavimbel izivakashi ukuba zivakashele i-Antarctica?","The correct answer is **A: Izindleko ezinkulu zokuhamba**.

Here's why:

*   **A:** The passage explicitly states that ""Ukuvakasha kwezivakashi kuyabiza..."" (Tourist visits are expensive...), making this a barrier.
*   **B:** The passage states that tourist visits are ""kulinganiselwe kakhulu ngokomthetho eNhlonhlweni, Eziqhingini kanye nasoLwandle iRoss"" (highly legally limited to the Peninsula, Islands and the Ross Sea). This implies that being interested in visiting this area would not prohibit visits
*   **C:** The passage states that tourist visits are possible only in summer from November to February. The information in the option therefore says the opposite
*   **D:** The passage indicates that travel is possible, just expensive and regulated.

"
Isivakashi esinesithakazelo ezintabeni singavakashela yiphi ingxenye yase-Antartica?,"The correct answer is **B: Indawo emaphakathi nezwe**.

The passage states ""Kwezinye izikhathi ukuvakasha kwasemoyeni kochwephesha kuya phakathi nezwe, ukugibela izintaba noma ukufinyelela kuyiPole, enesiqu esikhulu"" which translates to ""Occasionally specialist air tours go into the interior, for mountaineering or reaching the Pole, which has a large base"". Thus mountaineering is in the interior.
"
Ijwayele ukuba kuphi indawo yasendulo yokubuka?,"Based on the provided text, the best answer is:

**B: Enkabeni yedolobha**  and **D: Ekolishi**

The passage states that pre-modern observatories were often found in cities or schools (""zitholakala emadolobheni noma ezikoleni"").

Therefore, options B and D are both the correct answers."
Zijwayele ukubekwa kuphi izipopolo zokucwaninga zesimanje?,"Ngokwesitatimende esithi P, izinto zangaphambi kwenkathi yamanje ngokuvamile zihlala emamyuziyamu, ezindaweni zokufundisa noma emadolobheni/ezikoleni.

Ngakho-ke impendulo ithi:
**C: Endaweni yokufunda**
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iyiphi indawo ethule ukuze ujabulele usuku ebhishi?","The correct answer is **C: I-North Harbor District**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes the beaches in the North Harbor District as having many sandy beaches, being safe for swimming, and having shade from pohutukawa trees. It doesn't mention them being crowded.
*   The beaches on Tamaki Drive (Mission Bay and St Heliers) are described as popular family beaches that can be crowded, implying they are not quiet. Waitemata Harbour is just a location, not a specific beach, so it's not suitable to answer the question."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yiziphi izimo zasendaweni yokubhukuda ezibonakala siphephile?","Ngokwengxenye, ukubhukuda kuphephile eCentral Auckland. Ngakho-ke impendulo ithi:

Let's break down why:

*   **B: Ukushiya umaka endaweni ethile kwenye yezindawo** Directly violates the instruction against defacing the site with graffiti or markings.

*   **C: Ukwenza amahlaya:** Making jokes, especially about the Holocaust or Nazis (as specifically mentioned), shows a lack of the ""dignity, decency, and respect"" requested.

*   **D: Ukunweba isakhiwo:** There is no information in the prompt about expanding buildings, hence, this answer is likely to be incorrect.

*   **A: Ukwenza izenzo ezinesizotha (Performing respectful acts):** This is the *opposite* of inappropriate; it's exactly what the prompt is encouraging.

Therefore, **B, C and D** are the most inappropriate actions, in the order listed."
Yikuphi kulokhu okuchaza kahle ulimi lokuxhumana?,"Based on the passage provided, the best answer is **C: Okwakhiwe**.

The passage states that auxiliary languages are ""languages that are not natural but are constructed for the purpose of facilitating communication."" The word ""constructed"" translates directly to ""kwakhiwe"" in Zulu.
"
Yisiphi isitatimende esingazichazi ngokunembile izilimi ezisizayo?,"The answer is **B: Kunezilimi ezingokwemvelo kanti ezinye zakhiwe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that auxiliary languages are *not* natural (primary) languages. They are specifically *constructed* for communication.

The other options accurately reflect the information in the passage:

*   **A:** Correct: Auxiliary languages address communication barriers.
*   **C:** Correct: They are created to improve communication.
*   **D:** Correct: They bridge the gap between speakers of different languages."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini umgibeli okufanele ayibheke emkhumbini uma kuhanjewa ebusika?","The correct answer is **B: Izimfuneko ze-Visa**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kulindelwe ukuthi abahamba ngomkhumbi bahlangabezane nezimfuneko ze-visa (hlola imigomo)"" which means visa requirements are something passengers should be aware of.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, uma umkhumbi uhamba ehlobo, yini okufuneka bakwazi ukuyigwema?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuhamba eqhweni**.

The passage states that ice travel is a problem in winter because it causes discomfort. Therefore, if the cruise is in summer, they can avoid ice travel.
"
Kungani isiCatalan sivame ukusetshenziswa ezimpawini nasezazisweni zaseBarcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ulimi lokuqala olusemthethweni lwedolobha.**

"
Yiziphi kulezi zilimi ezilandelayo ezisetshenziswa uhlelo lwaseBarcelona iMetro ekwenzeni izaziso?,"The correct answer is **All of the above**. Here's why:

*   **A: IsiNgisi:** The passage states that unscheduled announcements are made in multiple languages, including English.
*   **B: IsiCatalan:** The passage states that regular announcements are made in Catalan.
*   **C: IsiPenishi:** The passage states that unscheduled announcements are made in multiple languages, including Spanish.

*   **B: Izinto zasendlini zakudala eziyikhethelo** (represented by ""indawo yokulala zikanokusho, mhlawumbe ingube yokwendlala eyenziwe ngezandla noma umbhede wasendulo"" and ""indawo ingaba esakhiweni sakudala esingokomlando esinempahla yamandulo"")
*   **C: Izindawo zangaphandle ezinakekelwa kahle** (represented by ""izingadi ezilungiswe kahle kanye nechibi lokubhukuda"")

The passage doesn't mention **D: I-inthanethi esheshayo**.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D**."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yiziphi kulezi zinto ezilandelayo ezingelona iphuzu elisemqoka lomncintiswano wezindawo zokulala zomntakabani?","Impendulo efanele ngu- **A: Impahla yokuhlobisa evamile**.

Indaba igcizelela ukuthi ama-B&B aphambili ancintisana ngezinto ezintathu eziyinhloko: izindawo zokulala (izingubo zikanokusho, umbhede wasendulo), ukudla kwasekuseni (ukudla okumnandi kwendawo, okukhethekile kombungazi), nendawo (isakhiwo esinomlando, izingadi ezilungiswe kahle, ichibi).
Ukudla okuzothathwa endaweni (D) kungalingana nokudla okumnandi kwendawo (ngalokho kukwenza iphuzu elisemqoka lokuncintisana). Ama-B&B anikeza ukudla kwasekuseni okuhlukahlukene (B) njengendlela yokuncintisana futhi izinga lezinto zombhede (C) njengezinto zikanokusho, ngakho konke lokhu kuyizinto ezisemqoka zokuncintisana.
Impahla yokuhlobisa evamile ayishiwo njengephuzu elibalulekile; kunalokho, indaba ikhuluma ngezinto zakudala njengoba zitholakala esakhiweni sakudala, esingokomlando."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungeke kuze kubanjelwe eBeijing ngo-2022?","The correct answer is **B: Indawo yemicimbi iTaizicheng yokutshuza eqhweni**.

The passage states that Taizicheng is where *some* of the skiing events will be held, and that it is located 220 km from Beijing. The passage states that Beijing will host indoor ice games, the opening ceremonies, and the closing ceremonies."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okuzobanjelwa eBeijing ngo-2022?","The correct answer is **B: Izenzakalo ezenzeka endaweni eneqhwa engaphakathi** and **D: Ukuvala imicimbi**.

The passage states:

*   ""Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and indoor ice sports.""
*   ""Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and indoor ice sports.""

Therefore, only options B and D are supported by the provided information.
"
Obani abasengcupheni enkulu yokuthola umkhuhlane wezinyoni?,"The correct answer is **C: Abantu abasebenza ngezinkukhu**.

The passage states: ""Abaningi bahlanganisa abantu abasebenza ngezinkukhu, kodwa zikhona nezingozi kubabheki bezinyoni."" While bird watchers are also at risk, the passage explicitly mentions that ""abaningi"" (many) associate the risk with people who work with poultry. Therefore, they are at a higher risk.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okuwuchaza ngokunembile umkhuhlane wezinyoni?","The correct answer is **C: Abantu abathanda ukubuka izinyoni basengcupheni yokutheleleka**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""...zikhona nezingozi kubabheki bezinyoni"" which translates to ""...there are also risks to bird watchers"".
*   The other options are incorrect based on the information in the passage:
    *   A: The passage says most cases were from people who work with poultry, but not that *only* they get it.
    *   B: The passage states that fewer than a thousand cases were reported in humans, so birds are infected more than humans.
    *   D: The passage says some cases were fatal, not all."
Umfula i-White Sea–Baltic Canal uxhumanisa ini nani?,"The correct answer is **C: Ulwandle i-Arctic noLwandle iBaltic**.

"
Iziphi kulezi zinkinga ezilandelayo engase iphakame lapho usezindaweni ezisemahlathini zaseSingapore?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Ukushiselwa kakhulu**.

The passage states that Singapore is located in a hot region and that one would need to deal with heat (constantly) and strong sun. This implies that being exposed to excessive heat is a potential problem. While the passage does mention that Singapore is a generally a safe place to visit, that has no implication to the experience of being in a forested area.
"
Obani okungase kudingeke ukuba bagweme ukudla izinto ezenziwe ngofulawa zaseJalimane?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Umuntu oguliswa amakinati**.

The passage states: ""Okuningi kokudla kwaseJalimane okubhakiwe kubuye kube nama-almondi, izindlubu zomhezela, kanye nezinye izindlubu zemithi.""

Almonds and hazelnuts are tree nuts, and if the passage mentions ""izinye izindlubu zemithi"", it is safe to say that a person with nut allergies should be wary of German baked goods. The passage doesn't mention any reasons why the people in options B, C, or D should avoid German baked goods.
"
Yisiphi isithako esibhekwa njengesivela ngenkathi ethile yaseJalimane?,"The correct answer is **C: Amapulamusi**.

The passage states: ""...nama-cherry namapulamu evela ngehlobo."" This indicates that plums are specifically associated with the summer season.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungeke kukhuthazwe esilinganisweni semali yokuvakasha?","The correct answer is **C: Ukucela abantu imali** (Begging people for money).

The passage explicitly states that the advice it provides does not include travelers begging. The other options (A, B, and D) are consistent with the passage's discussion of ways to travel inexpensively by working or adjusting to a basic standard of living to minimize costs.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ubani ongase abe nesikhathi esinzima sokuvakasha ngemali encane kakhulu?","The correct answer is **B: Umuntu ongakwazi ukuzibamba uma kuziwa ekuchitheni isikhathi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that those who travel very cheaply are ""willing to sacrifice comfort, **time**, and predictability.""
*   Option B is the only one that references 'time' making it difficult for them to enjoy a cheap vacation.

The other options don't fit:

*   **A:** The passage indicates that one should not be a problem causer to travel very cheaply.

*   **C:** The passage states that it will focus on people balancing their cost and not people working.

*   **D:** The passage indicates that one should be open to unpredictability which is a key component of adventure."
Yisiphi kulezi zitatimende esingakuchazi ngokunembile ukushayela phakathi nePoint Marion kanye neFairmont?,"The statement that does NOT accurately describe driving between Point Marion and Fairmont is:

**C: Akulula ukulalela isivinini esiphakeme**

The passage explicitly states that speed limits are significantly lower (35-40 mph) in this area compared to other parts of the route. Therefore, it is *difficult* to drive at high speeds. The other options are all accurate descriptions based on the passage.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okufanele kube inkinga kubashayeli abahamba kuthela wayeka waseBuffalo-Pittsburg?","The correct answer is **C: Ukujika kungazelele.**

The passage explicitly mentions ""amajika amabi agcwele"" (bad curves abound) as a challenging aspect of driving in that area. The passage doesn't mention anything about traffic jams, road workers, and even states that cell service is strong in that area.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungadingi ukuba uqale umdlalo wokugxuma ezintabeni?,"Based on the passage, canyoneering ""requires very little training or physical fitness to get started.""

Therefore, the answer is **D: Ukuqeqeshwa kancane**.

The passage states that canyoneering involves swimming, climbing and jumping, implying that one would need to know how to swim and jump. It contrasts the training involved in Canyoneering versus activities like Alpine Skiing, implying that a high level of physical fitness is not necessarily required to participate.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungase kudingeke lapho kuvakashelwa izindawo okugxunywa kuzo ezintabeni?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Amakhono okubhukuda**.

"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engaba usizo kumuntu ohlela ukulala emotweni yakhe?","The correct answer is **B: Imoto ekwazi ukuvumela izitulo ukuba zilale**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Ukukanisa emotweni kungenzeka lapho uneveni encane, i-SUV, iSedan noma iStation Wagon esinezihlalo ezikwazi ukulala."" This makes B the most direct and necessary factor for car camping.
*   A is partly correct because the article mentions getting familiar with the car to be useful, so it is useful to have a deep understanding of the car limitations
*   C is incorrect because the passage states that car camping is an alternative to using a tent.
*   D is incorrect because the passage states that the point of car camping is to avoid needing a campsite."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini abantu abakhempa ngezimoto abangafuna ukuyigwema uma befuna ukungalahleki?","The correct answer is **C: Ukumisa amatende edolobheni noma endaweni yomuntu**.

"
"Njengoba ugibela itekisi eCharlotte, yini engakwenza ukhokhe imali eyengeziwe?","The correct answer is **B: Ukugibela nibathathu**.

The passage states: ""Kunenhlawulo engaphezulu yokuba nabagibeli abangaphezu kuka-2, ngakho lokhu ongakukhetha kungaba okubiza kakhulu kunalokho okudingekayo."" This directly indicates that having more than two passengers (therefore, three or more) will result in an extra charge.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engabhekelwa phansi ngokuhlala nezingane eCharlotte?","The passage indicates that families in Charlotte are unlikely to use taxis because they are often unnecessary and can be expensive due to extra passenger fees.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okuwukufana okunembile phakathi kweHawaii kanye neSiqhingi iCook?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Zombili lezi zindawo azinawo amadolobha**.

Here's why:

*   The text states ""IziQhingi zaseCook azinawo noma imaphi amadolobha...""
*   The text also implies that Cook Islands is similar to Hawaii before it's development as a state, before the inclusion of Hotels. This implies that current Hawaii does have big hotels, but that Cook Islands is similar to how Hawaii was *before* this development.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungayichazi ngokunembile iSiqhingi iCook?,"The correct answer is **C: Amadolobha ayinhloko yiRarotonga ne-Aitutaki**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""IziQhingi zaseCook azinawo noma imaphi amadolobha kodwa zenziwe yiziqhingi ezingu-15 ezihlukahlukene. Eziyinhloko iRarotong kanye ne-Aitutaki."" This means Rarotonga and Aitutaki are primary *islands*, not cities.

"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ungayilondoloza kuphi imvume yokupaka uma ufuna ukusebenzisa imali engukheshi kunokusebenzisa ikhadi lezikweletu?","The correct answer is **B: EPuerto Jiménez**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Kuyenzeka ukuthola izimvume zepaki ngokuqondile Esiteshi Somphathi Wendawo ePuerto Jiménez, kodwa abemukeli wonke amakhadi wokuthenga ngesikweletu."" This indicates you can get park permits in Puerto Jiménez, and it mentions the credit card limitations, implying cash is an option there.
*   The passage also mentions that CafeNet El Sol offers booking services, but it's clear that this is a service that they charge for, and not the official location.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   Sirena is a ranger station, not a place to obtain permits.
*   La Leona is a camping location, not a place to obtain permits."
"Ngokwale ndaba, uhlobo olunjani lokutshuza olwenziwa ezindaweni ezenyukelayo?","The correct answer is **C: Ukuqwala intaba**.

The passage states ""...kuphela ungathola isivinini sokushushuluza eqhweni ezindaweni ezingajwayelekile ngaphandle kwesikhwama esisindayo emizileni elungisiwe."" This means that to achieve higher speeds in backcountry skiing (without a heavy pack), one needs to be on groomed trails.
"
Abathatha abahambo bahlabezana nokwethuka kokuphinde bangene banesikhathi esinzima sokwenzani?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukuphinde uzivumelanise nesiko lasekhaya**.

The passage explicitly states that people who travel abroad often find it difficult to readjust to their home culture upon returning. This is the core idea behind ""ukuthuka ngoba usekhaya"" (reverse culture shock). The passage highlights that while adapting to a new culture abroad might be easier due to the understanding and patience of locals, the same level of understanding is not always extended to returning travelers struggling to reintegrate into their own culture. Therefore, the main struggle of those experiencing reverse culture shock is readapting to their home culture.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ukuthuswa ukubuya kungase kube nzima ngokukhethekile kumuntu ovakashile onjani?","Impendulo efanele ngu **B: Abahambi abasheshe bazivumelanise nempilo yakwelinye izwe**.

Isizathu:

Indaba ithi abantu abasheshe bazivumelanise nesiko elisha kwesinye isikhathi bakuthola kunzima ukujwayela isiko labo. Lokhu kusho ukuthi uma umuntu ejwayele impilo yelinye izwe ngokushesha futhi kalula, kungaba nzima kakhulu ukuzivumelanisa nempilo yakubo lapho ebuya.

"
Yini elandelayo abantu okufanele bagweme ukuyenza nge-moose?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukusondela kuyo kancane**.

The passage states that approaching moose too closely can put people in danger. Therefore, the thing people should avoid doing is getting too close.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isitatimende esilandelayo esingelona iqiniso nge-moose?","The correct answer is **A: Iyisilwane esinolaka**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that moose are *not* aggressive and will only defend themselves when they perceive a threat. This directly contradicts the statement that they are aggressive animals.
*   The other options are all true based on the passage:
    *   B: Ngezinye izikhathi azibonakali zingaba nobungozi (Sometimes they do not appear dangerous) - The passage implies this by saying people underestimate the danger.
    *   C: Zingathuswa abantu lapho besondela kakhulu (They can be startled by people when they get too close) - This is why they might perceive a threat and defend themselves.
    *   D: Imoose izozivikela uma kunesidingo (Moose will defend themselves if necessary) - This is explicitly stated in the passage.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okungase kube ingozi ngomuntu ohamba ogwadule?","Zonke izimpendulo ezibaliwe zingaba yingozi kumuntu ohamba ogwadule ngokwale ndaba. Ngakho-ke, impendulo eyiyo yile:

*   **C: Ukwehla kwamazinga okushisa komzimba:** Ikhulunywe ngokuqondile engxenyeni ye-P njengengozi ebusuku.
*   **D: Ukushiswa ilanga:** Ayikhulunywanga engxenyeni ye-P, nakuba kuyingozi enkulu ogwadule, akuyona leyo engxenye ekhuluma ngayo.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yiliphi iqembu labantu elathinteka kakhulu ngemva kokufika abahloli?","The correct answer is C: AbaseTaínos.

The passage states that the Taíno population was significantly reduced by the Spanish conquistadors after the arrival of European explorers. The passage further mentions that the Spanish conquistadors killed approximately 100,000 Taínos between 1492 and 1498.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yiluphi ulimi olwalukhulunywa abantu baseCaribe?","The correct answer is **D: Isi-Arawaka**.

The passage states: ""AmaCaribe bekungabantu abakhuluma isi-Arawaka...""
"
Ubani onganconywa ngokudumisa ukutshuza njengomdlalo?,"The correct answer is **B: Abantu baseNorway**.

The passage states that in 1861, a recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia. This suggests they were instrumental in popularizing skiing as a recreational activity.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, kwakungasiphi isikhathi lapho kwabhekwa khona okokuqala ukutshuza njengomdlalo?","The correct answer is **C: Ngo-1861**.

The passage states: ""...ngo-1861 iqembu lokushushuluza eqhweni kokuzilibazisa lavulwa abantu baseNorway e-Australia."" This indicates that 1861 was when skiing began to be formalized as a recreational activity, thus a sport.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okumane kuhlotshaniswe njengesiqhingi esikhulu esisogwini olusempumalanga ye-Afrika?,"The correct answer is **C: Izilwane zasendle**.

The passage states that Madagascar is the largest island and ""a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife"". Therefore, wildlife is associated with the largest island off the east coast of Africa.
"
Yini engesona isici seziqhingi ezincane eMpumalanga Ye-Afrika? ,"The correct answer is **C: Idumela lezilwane zasendle**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that Madagascar is like a continent regarding wildlife, implying that this is specific to Madagascar rather than the smaller islands in general.

The other options are supported by the text:
* **A: Ukuxhumana neFrance:** The text says the islands are affiliated with France.
* **B: Izindawo zokuncebeleka eziningi:** The text says the islands are known as luxury beach vacation spots.
* **D: Ukunganciki kwamanye amazwe:** The text says that many of the smaller islands are independent nations."
"Ngokwale ndaba, ama-Easter agujwa kanjani ngamanye amasonto?","The correct answer is **B: Kubanjwa umlindelo ngoMgqibelo ebusuku**

The passage states: ""Amaningi amasonto akudala asazibamba Izinkonzo zePhasika njalo ngoMgqibelo ebusuku ngesikhathi sempelasonto yePhasika..."" This directly supports option B.
"
"Ukuze ugweme izimfuneko ezithile lapho ufika e-Ecuador, umuntu waseCuba kufanele abe nani kuqala?","The correct answer is **D: Igreen card yase-US**.

Here's why: The passage explicitly states that Cuban citizens who have a permit to reside and work in the United States must visit the Ecuadorian consulate to obtain an exemption from this requirement. A green card is evidence of a permit to reside and work in the US.
"
Izimfuneko zase-Ecuador zokuvakasha azenzelwe ini yona?,"The best answer is **B: Ukuqondisa ukufika kwabantu abavela kwamanye amazwe**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that these requirements are ""designed to provide an organized pathway for migration between the two countries."" This directly implies a goal of managing and directing the flow of people (migration) between Cuba and Ecuador.
*   While other options might be partially true (e.g., ensuring a valid passport, knowing the duration of stay), the overarching purpose, as stated in the passage, is to create a structured system for managing migration.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **B**."
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungabiza kakhulu kwelinye izwe kunasezweni lakini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ifuleyimu yezibuko**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that high-end name-brand frames can be expensive in other countries, potentially more so than at home, due to counterfeit issues or higher import costs for genuine frames.
*   The passage suggests that Ukuhlolwa amehlo can be less expensive in countries with a lower cost of living. Umshwalense wokubona, being a service, isn't directly discussed as being cheaper or more expensive abroad. Ifuleyimu engenalo igama isn't explicitly mentioned as being more or less expensive, but it's implied that they wouldn't have the same markups as name-brand frames."
Yibuphi ubungozi bokuthenga ifuleyimu kwelinye izwe?,"Based on the passage, the risks of buying frames in another country are:

*   **The frames might be fake.** (The passage mentions some frames might be counterfeit.)
*   **The real frames (brand name) could be more expensive than at home.** (The passage explicitly states this.)

Therefore, the best answer is **D: Umshwalense ungase ungayikhokheli**
"

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Amaphawundi wase-Britain ngokuvamile azokwamukelwa noma yikuphi eziqhingini.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage mentions credit cards and US dollars being accepted in Stanley, so it's not *only* credit cards and British pounds.
*   **B:** The passage states US dollars are *usually* accepted in Stanley, but not exclusively.
*   **C:** The passage states: ""Cishe akwenzeki ukushintshelana imali yaseFalklands ngaphandlwe kweziqhingi, ngakho-ke shintshelana imali ngaphambi kokuhamba eziqhingini."" Meaning you should exchange the money before leaving the islands."
"Ngokwale ndaba, lapho uvakashela iFalkland uqhamuka e-United States, iyiphi indlela yokukhokha engase ibe usizo ngaphandle kokusebenzisa ikhadi le-credit?","The correct answer is **D: Kuyo yonke indawo yaseStanley**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""...inside Stanley... United States dollars are also commonly accepted."" This indicates that US dollars would be a useful payment method in Stanley, besides credit cards.
*   The passage says that British pounds are ""generally accepted anywhere in the islands"" implying that US dollars may not be as commonly used.
*   The passage says that credit cards are not commonly accepted on outer islands, so the US dollar would be more useful in Stanley than on other islands.
*   The FIC West store is used to locate the only bank on the islands, and does not state that it would be a useful method of payment."
Yisiphi isenzakalo esingahlobene nokugubha umkhosi wasethempelini?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukuzalwa kwendlovu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that temple festivals are generally celebrated to commemorate the temple's anniversary or the presiding deity's birthday.
*   The passage does talk about elephants being part of the festival, but not about the birth of an elephant.

The other options align with the information provided in the passage."
Zingabonakala kuphi izindlovu ezihlotshisiwe?,"The best answer is **C: Lapho kuqhubeka imikhosi ethempelini**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the decorated elephants are part of the temple festivals.

Let's examine why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Yonke indawo kusukela ekupheleni kukaNovemba kuya phakathi kukaMeyi** - It is true that temple festivals happen from November to May, but it doesn't mean you will see decorated elephants everywhere.
*   **B: Emathempelini** - You might not see decorated elephants at all temples all the time.
*   **D: Emigwaqweni yaseKerala** - While the processions might spill out onto the streets near the temple, the main event is at the temple, so this is not the most precise answer."
"Ngokwale ndaba, iyiphi indlela kulezi ezilandelayo ongalondoloza ngayo imali uma ugibela i-business noma i-first class ebhanoyini?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuthenga usebenzisa inkampani**.

The passage states: ""Indlela esobala yokugibela egumbini lendiza elibizayo noma labebhizinisi ukukhipha imali eningi yalelo lungelo (noma, okungcono, wenze inkampani yakho ikwenzele lokho)."" This clearly indicates that having your company pay is a way to save money personally.

The passage explicitly states that option D (getting a discount) is generally difficult. Options B and C are not mentioned as ways to save money in the passage.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engaba ukumosha isikhathi ukuba uyifune lapho ufuna ukubhuka isigaba esithile?","The correct answer is **C: Izaphulelo**.

The passage states: ""Ngokuvamile, akusizi ngisho nokufuna izaphulelo ezihlalweni zabebhizinisi noma ezinethezekile ohabweni lwendiza oluqondile olusuka ku-A luye ku-B."" This means it's generally not helpful to ask for discounts on business or first class seats. Therefore, seeking discounts would be a waste of time.
"
Yini okungafanele yengezwe lapho uqhathanisa amanani okuya e-Afrika kanye namanani omhlaba wonke?,"The correct answer is **B: Izindleko zentela yokuhamba e-Afrika**.

The prompt directs you to compare the costs of traveling to Africa *versus* traveling around the world. It specifically instructs you to include extra costs (visa, travel tax, transport, etc.) *for destinations outside Africa*. Therefore, costs specifically related to Africa (like travel tax within Africa or costs of visas for Africans) should not be added when calculating the extra cost of a round-the-world trip for comparison purposes.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini izitolo ezinkulu eseziqala ukuyinikeza ehlukile ongayikhetha?","The correct answer is **A: Ukudla osekulungile** (Food that is already prepared).

The passage states: ""Izitolo ezinkulu ngokwandayo zithola ingxenye ehlukahlukene kakhulu yokudla okulungele ukudliwa."" (Supermarkets are increasingly getting a much more diverse selection of food that is ready to eat.)
"
Yiluphi usizo olunikezwa ezinye izitolo ezinkulu okungase kuthandeke kumakhasimende athenga ukudla osekulungile?,"The passage mentions that some supermarkets offer ""microwave ovens or another way to heat food."" Therefore, the correct answer is:

*   **D: Microwaves and ovens**"
Yini elandelayo engase ingaqondwa abantu abakhuluma isiFulentshi baseBelgium kanye nabaseSwitzerland?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Indlela yesiFulentshi yokusebenzisa izinombolo**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that the number system in Belgium and French-speaking Switzerland is different from that of France. And this difference is something that Belgian and Swiss French speakers *may* not understand if a standard French counting method is used.
*   The text also indicates that while pronunciation differences exist, they are minor. Therefore, option ""C"" is incorrect.
*   The other options are incorrect as well."
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungafani eFrance njengoba kunjalo eBelgium noma eSwitzerland?,"The correct answer is **B: Indlela izinombolo ezibizwa ngayo**.

The passage specifically states that the system of counting is notably different in Belgium and French-speaking Switzerland compared to France. While pronunciation differences exist (D), the most significant and explicitly mentioned difference is in how numbers are expressed. All French-speaking people in those countries learn standard French in school (C), and the passage doesn't imply a complete difference in the pronunciation of *all* words (A), but rather specific words.
"
Kukusiphi isibonelo lapho kungabonakali khona ukuthi ungathola isibonelelo sokushonelwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Uma uhamba ngeLufthansa usuka ePeris uya e-United States**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** Lufthansa only offers bereavement fares for flights originating in the US or Canada. A flight from Paris to the United States wouldn't qualify.
*   **A and D are incorrect** The passage mentions WestJet and Delta as airlines that offer bereavement fares.
*   **B is incorrect** The passage states that you *must* book directly with the airline by phone, not that you're unlikely to get bereavement fares if you book by phone"
Ikuphi okuyiqiniso ngesibonelelo sokushonelwa?,"The correct answer is **D: Kufanele kubhukwe ngokuqondile nabezindiza usebenzisa ucingo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kuzo zonke izimo, kumelwe ubhukhe ngefoni ngokuqondile nenkampani yezindiza.""

"Ngokwale ndaba, ungaqiniseka kanjani ukuthi uqondaniswa nomkhumbi ofanele?","The correct answer is **C: Bhukha usebenzisa i-ejenti osebenza ngabavakashela eGalapago**.

The passage specifically states: ""Qinisekisa ukuthi umuntu okubhukelayo unguchwepheshe wamaGalapago onalwazi oluhle lwezinhlobonhlobo eziningi zemikhumbi. Lokhu kuzoqinisekisa ukuthi onesithakazelo kukho ngokukhethekile kanye/noma okukucindezelayo kuhambisana nomkhumbi okufanele kakhulu."" This directly supports using a Galapagos travel expert to ensure a good match.
"

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that casinos offer ""ukudla okukhethekile, iziphuzo kanye nokuzijabulisa, ukuze bagcine izivakashi zithokozile, futhi bazigcine ziphakathi kwawo."" This translates to ""special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and keep them inside.""
*   The passage also mentions that alcohol intoxicates the mind, which is something good gamblers are aware of. This implies that casinos provide alcohol to encourage continued gambling, even if it's detrimental to the gambler's strategy.
*   The other options are either contradictory to the passage or not mentioned:

    *   A: Ukuningi bokukhanya kwemvelo: (Lots of natural light) The passage says windows are generally absent.
    *   B: Ukubakhuthaza ngokubapha amathikithi amahhala: (Encouraging them by giving them free tickets) Free tickets are not mentioned.
    *   D: Ukungabikhona kwamawashi: (Absence of clocks) This is correct, and is mentioned in the text, but this is less of a tactic used to get people to *continue* gambling, and more of a tactic used to get people to gamble for longer in the first place. Drinks are something that can be continuously offered to encourage continued gambling.

Therefore, offering drinks is a direct tactic mentioned in the passage to encourage visitors to keep gambling."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini umuntu ogembulayo ohlakaniphile okufanele ayigweme?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuphuza kakhulu utshwala**.

The passage states: ""Nokho, ukudakwa kudunga ingqondo, bonke abantu abagembulayo abahle bayakwazi ukubaluleka kokuhlala usangulukile."" This clearly indicates that a smart gambler should avoid getting drunk.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iyiphi ingxenye yenkulumo eyenziwa osonhlamvukazi phakathi nomusho?","The correct answer is **B: Amabizo**

The passage explicitly states: ""Wonke amabizo, kanye negama elithi Sie kuwe, ahlala aqala ngosonhlamvukazi, ngisho noma ephakathi komusho."" This translates to ""All nouns, as well as the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.""
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engeza kuhluke ukwenza amabizo abe osonhlamvukazi?","The correct answer is **A: Ukufunda**.

The passage explicitly states that capitalizing nouns makes reading easier: ""Ngokobufakazi obukhona kwenza ukufunda kube lula..."" (With the evidence available, it makes reading easier...).

While the passage also mentions distinguishing between verbs and things (B and D), the main point is that capitalization *improves reading comprehension*. Option C is incorrect because the passage says capitalization makes writing more complicated.
"
"Ezindaweni zasemaphandleni zaseMalaysia, isiphi isenzo esisho “ukuqoba”?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **B: Ukushwiba isandla** (Waving the hand).

The passage states that in rural Malaysia, waving the hand means ""come here,"" similar to a beckoning gesture.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, isiphi isenzo esingase sisho “ukubuya”?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuhambisa isandla usebenzisa isihlakala sibheke ngaphakathi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that in Spain, a wave with the palm facing the waver (moving the hand using the wrist inward towards oneself) can be misinterpreted by a British traveler as meaning ""come here""."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini ebangela imifantu?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **A: Amabhuloho eqhwa**.

The passage states that the glaciers are unstable and slide down the mountain. This movement causes cracking and crevasses that can be hidden by snow bridges. Therefore, snow bridges are what cause crevasses.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okungafihlwa amabhuloho amaqhwa?","The passage states: ""Lokhu kuzobangela ukuqhekeka, imifantu, engafihlwa amabhuloho eqhwa."" This directly translates to: ""This will cause cracks, fissures, which cannot be hidden by snow bridges.""

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Ukuklayeka** (Cracks/Fissures)
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, abantu abahambayo kufanele bathathe izinyathelo zokuphepha ngaphambi kokuvakashela ziphi izindawo?","The correct answer is **B: Izindawo ezizungeze iGoma** (The areas outside of Goma).

The passage explicitly states: ""Nakuba iGoma iphephile ngokwezinga elithile, noma ikuphi ukuvakasha **ngaphandle kweGoma** kumelwe kucwaningwe ukuze uzwisise isimo sokulwa okusesifundazweni saseNyakatho Kivu."" This translates to: ""Although Goma is relatively safe, any travel **outside of Goma** should be researched to understand the state of conflict in the North Kivu province.""
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungeke kube kuhle ngomuntu ovakashele iGoma?,"The correct answer is **C: Amabhayisikili izinto ezikahle kakhulu zokuhamba hamba**

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions using ""boda-boda (itekisi lesithuthuthu)"" for getting around Goma. It doesn't mention bicycles as a mode of transport, therefore C is not correct

Here's why the other options are ok:

*   **A: Izimpi zokulwa eNorth Kivu ziyathakazlisa** The passage advises researching conflict in North Kivu, this suggest that a person who's interested in this would be good
*   **B: Yindawo enhle kubantu abathanda iMountain Gorilla Tracking:** The passage states Goma is a base for cheaper mountain gorilla tracking.
*   **D: Isizinda sentabamlilo yaseNyiragongo sisedolobheni:** The passage states ""Idolobha libuye libe isiqu sentabamlilo iNyiragongo"""
Imvume yokuhamba endawni engagadiwe mayelana nosuku lokuqala ngo-Agasti izotholakala nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngomhlaka-1 Aphreli**.

Here's why:

The passage states that backcountry permits become available on the first day of the month, four months before the *start* month of the hike. Since the hike starts in August, you count back four months:

August -> July -> June -> April. So, the permits become available on April 1st.
"
Iyiphi inqubomgomo ekhona mayelana nokuvikela udonga olubangelwa umvula?,"The correct answer is **D: Kunamanani alinganiselwe ezimvume**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Izimvume zinginganiselwe ukuze kuvikelwe izindonga ezinkulu ezenziwa umfula."" This directly supports option D. The purpose of limiting permits is to protect the Grand Canyon's walls from erosion caused by overuse.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uhlelo lokusiza ofike kuqala:** While there's a portion of permits set aside for walk-ins on a first-come, first-served basis, this isn't the overall policy for protecting the walls from erosion.
*   **B: Imvume itholakala kuphela ngomhlaka-1 Januwari:** The passage mentions that permits for May departures become available on January 1st, but it doesn't mean that's the *only* day you can get a permit.
*   **C: Imvume itholakala kuphela ngokuthi ungene ngenyawo uzoyicela:** This is incorrect. Although some permits are available for walk-ins, they are not the only means of obtaining a permit."
Yikuphi kulokhu okungase kutholakale ohlotsheni lwehhotela elichazwe kule ndaba?,"The correct answer is **C: Izivakashi ezaziwa kahle futhi eziqashelwayo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that these hotels were where ""abacebile nabadumile bangaleyo nkathi ababehlala khona"". This directly implies that well-known and noticeable guests would have been common.
*   Option A mentions ""Itafula elinotshwala"" while this may have been an option, it doesn't reflect the essence of the rich culture in the story.
*   Option B mentions ""Indawo yokudlela esesakhiweni yabantu abathanda ukudla"", while this is definitely a possibility, it does not reflect the main focus of the rich and famous as the story mentions.
*   Option D mentions ""Amagumbi alungiswe ngezinto zesimanje"" is incorrect because the passage specifically states that these hotels lack modern amenities (""nokwentuleka kwezakamuva"").
"
"Ngokwalolu lwazi olulandelayo kule ndaba, yiziphi izinto ezinikezwayo lezo izivakashi zasehhotela ezingase zingakubheki njengokusemqoka?","Ngokwalolu lwazi, into izivakashi ezingase zingayibheki njengokusemqoka yi:

**D: Amagumbi angabizi**

Isizathu: Indaba igxile ekutheni lawa mahhotela ayenezihambi ezicebile nezidumile ngaphambilini. Umhambi onemali eningi ucabangela ""uhambo lwendiza oluzungeza umhlaba wonke,"" okusho ukuthi intengo ayiyona into ebajwayele kakhulu. Ezinye izinketho (ifenisha yasendulo, indawo yokudlela enhle, nokuphila ebusuku) zonke ziyizinto ezingavuma izihambi ezicebile futhi ezibuthakathaka ezazingathanda ukuzibona emhambweni ohlanganisa ukuhlala kula mahhotela.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engagwenya izivakashi lapho zivakashela iGreenland?","The correct answer is **D: Ukubhekisela kubantu baseGreenland ngokuthi “ama-Eskimo”**.

The passage specifically states that while the term ""Eskimo"" might still be acceptable in America, it is considered offensive to many Arctic people, especially in Canada, and should be avoided by foreigners in Greenland. The passage doesn't explicitly mention to avoid A, B, and C.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini elandelayo engase ibe inkinga ngezivakashi ezingazilungiselele lapho zivakashela iGreenland?","The correct answer is **C: Isimo sezulu**.

The passage explicitly states that the cold weather is likely the only real danger that unprepared tourists will encounter. While Nordic mosquitoes can be irritating, they are not as significant of a risk as the cold. The passage mentions that crime is virtually unknown, and mistreatment of foreigners is uncommon, making options B and D incorrect.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo manje okusetshenziswa njengenkaba yezindawo zomphakathi edolobheni?,"The correct answer is **A: IJardín de la Unión**.

The passage states that the Jardín de la Unión ""is now serving as the main stage in the city.""
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungatholakali eJardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **B: Indawo enezindaba zothando zakudala.**

Here's why:

*   **A: Izindawo ezimaphakathi zamatende ezinekhonsathi:** The passage states ""emini nasentambama lapho amakhonsati wamahhala avame ukunikezwa kusuka etendeni eliyinhloko.""
*   **C: Izingadi ezibheke izindawo zokudla:** The passage states ""Kunezitolo zokudlela eziningana ezizungeze ingadi"".
*   **D: Isakhiwo esidala esinezinto zamasonto:** The passage states the space was originally built as a church courtyard in the 17th century, around the ""Templo de San Diego"".

The ""Alley of the Kiss"" and the legend of love are described separately, not as being *within* the Jardín de la Unión itself, but as another attraction in the city.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isitatimende esilandelayo mayelana nosuku lokuqwala olubonakala lunganembile?","The answer is **D: Ukusuku lokuqwala alulona usuku okufanele lwangaphandle emndenini enabantwana**.

The passage explicitly states that families with young children can enjoy day hiking, even with toddlers and preschoolers, though they may require extra preparation. This directly contradicts option D. The other options align with information provided in the text.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, kunini lapho usuku lokuqwala ludinga ukulungiselela okuncane?","Ngokusekelwe endimeni, impendulo elungile ithi:

**B: Uma kuzohanjwa endaweni elula**

Indima ithi ukuhamba emini emzileni olula kudinga ukuzilungiselela okuncane. Ezinye izinketho zidinga ukulungiselela okwengeziwe (izingane) noma azithinti ngqo ukuzilungiselela okuncane (okuqine ngokomzimba, indawo enokwemvelo).
"
Uyini umehluko ngamathafa aseRogaland noma e-Agder uma eqhathaniswa nawo wonke aseNorway?,"The correct answer is **D: Avame ukumbozwa izimbali eziphephuli**

Here's why:

* The passage states that in Rogaland and Agder, the ""hei"" (heathland) is ""kaningi embozwe i-heather,"" which translates to ""often covered in heather."" Heather is known for its purple flowers.
* The rest of Norway refers to the plateau as ""vidde"" and does not include the characteristic of being covered in heather.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anezihlahla** - This is the opposite of what the passage implies. Both ""vidde"" and ""hei"" are described as treeless.
*   **B: Izindawo eziphakathi nentaba ezinemifula**- While there may be areas that are in the middle of a mountain and have rivers, the passage does not explicitly mention this or indicate a difference.
*   **C: Amathafa iningi lawo ayalingana** - The passage specifically states that Norway's fjords open into plateaus. Therefore, this information is not exclusive to Rogaland and Agder
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungeke kujwayeleke ngeNorway?","Ngokusekelwe kulwazi olunikeziwe, impendulo efanele ngu:

**B: Amathafa anezihlahla**

Isizathu:

*   Indaba ichaza ukungenela kolwandle, amawa, izigodi, amathafa aphakeme (i-""vidde"" okuyindawo evulekile engenamithi), kanye nezinkangala (i-""hei"" engavamile ukuba nezihlahla).
*   Ayishiwo nhlobo amathafa anezihlahla, okwenza kube yinto engavamile ngokwendalo yaseNorway ngokwale ndaba."
Izivakashi ezithanda ukutshuza kufanele zisivakashele nini isiteshi esisegqumeni?,"Impendulo elungile ngu: **A: Phakathi nasebusika**

Isizathu: Isitatimende esinikeziwe sikwenza kucace ukuthi iziteshi zamagquma zithola ukukhanga okungeziwe phakathi nobusika ngenxa yeqhwa, okuvumela imisebenzi efana nokushushuluza eqhweni nokuntweza ngoqembe eqhweni. Ngakho-ke, uma umuntu ethanda ukushushuluza eqhweni, kufanele avakashele phakathi nasebusika.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, kunini lapho kuvame ukuba khona nezivakashi eziningi esiteshini esisegqumeni?","The correct answer is **C: Phakathi nehlobo laseNdiya**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Inkathi yezivakashi ezindaweni zamagquma iyenyuka phakathi nehlobo laseNdiya.""
"
Yini okufanele uyigweme uma unethemba lokuthola isikebhe sidinga usizo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukugwema abantu abacela ukuhayikha isikembe (Avoiding people asking to hitch a ride on boats)**.

The passage explicitly advises meeting and talking to others looking for boat work to share information.  Therefore, avoiding them would be the opposite of what you should do.  The other options are all things the passage suggests doing.
"
Yini okufanele uyenze eduzane nethekhu lesikebhe lapho ubheka isikebhe esidinga usizo?,"Based on the provided text, the best answer is **B: Hlale usendaweni lapho ungabonakala khona.**

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes the importance of making yourself known: ""Ngemva kwesikhashana wonke umuntu uzokwazi..."" (After a while everyone will know you...). Being visible near the docks is a way to achieve this.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Xhumana nomshayeli waso** The paragraph doesn't specifically say that you should seek out the captain
*   **C: Iya kubantu kuphela lapho besahlanza izikebhe zabo** While helping clean is mentioned as one activity, the passage is broader. It's about talking to many people, not just those cleaning.
*   **D: Gwema abacela ukuhayikha isikebhe** On the contrary, you should seek them out because they will be able to share their experiences.

Therefore, **B** best aligns with the passage's overall message of making connections and being visible to find opportunities.
"
Iyiphi indawo engabonakala ikhanga izivakashi ngomlando wamakholoni eziqhingini?,"The correct answer is **A: Ogwini oluseNyakatho**.

The passage states: ""Le indawo abenzi bamakoloni baseBrithani abayithatha njengendawo yabo ngakho uma ufuna ukubona ubufakazi besikhathi esedlule sobukoloni salendawo, lena indawo efanele ongaqala kuyo.""  It also says, ""Iningi kokuthuthuka kwase-Hong Kong Island kugcwele ezweni elisanda kubuyiswa futhi ogwini olusenyakatho."" This directly links the north shore with the colonial history that tourists might be interested in.
"
Iyiphi indawo engakhanga izivakashi ebheka ukubukeka kwendawo njengokubalulekile?,"The correct answer is **D: NgaseKowloon**.

The passage states: ""Ukuze ube nemibono emihle kakhulu ye-Hong Kong, shiya lesi siqhingi uye echibini lamanzi lase-Kowloon eliqondene."" This clearly indicates that the Kowloon waterfront offers the best views of Hong Kong.
"
Yini ezinye izinhlalo zamahhashi ezinakho ukusiza unciphise ukulimala konyawo lomgibeli lapho lubamnjwe umchilo?,"The correct answer is **C: into yokunyathela eyisikhumba**.

The passage states that some English saddles have ""safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to fall away from the saddle when the stirrup is pulled backwards by a falling rider."" The ""stirrup leather"" is the leather strap that connects the stirrup (the ""into yokunyathela"") to the saddle.
"
Yisiphi isici esisiza unyawo lomgibeli ukuba andise amathuba okuphepha lapho esebenzisa into yokunyathela?,"The correct answer is **C: Isithende**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions ""abagibeli abaningi bagqoka amabhuzi okugibela anesithende kanye nesoli ebushelelezi, ecijile"" as a safety measure related to stirrups. The heel helps prevent the foot from slipping *through* the stirrup.
"
Yini enikezwa izivakashi ngokuxhumana ngokushintshisana kwezihambi?,"The correct answer is **A: Izindawo zokuhlala bese kuba khona umuntu wendawo ozonakekela** (Accommodation and a local person to take care of them).

The passage explicitly states that hospitality exchange networks connect travelers with locals in the cities they are visiting, implying that the locals will provide accommodation and assistance. While the passage also mentions the story of finding cheap flights, it's not a general offering of hospitality exchange networks.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi kulezi zitatimende ezilandelayo mayelana nokushintshana ngezokuxhumana okungelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **A: Abavakashi bahlale benikezwa ukusikiselwa ngabantu bendawo abamukelanayo.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that hosts ""are sometimes provided with references and reviews from other travelers."" The word 'sometimes' indicates that this is not always the case.
*   The other options are supported by the passage:
    *   B: The text mentions that some networks ""offer or require references.""
    *   C: The passage states that ""A list of available hosts is offered in print and/or online.""
    *   D: The text states that host lists are ""sometimes provided with references and reviews from other travelers.""

Therefore, statement A is the only one that is not entirely true based on the passage."
"Ngokwale ndaba, uhlobo olunjani lwezivakashi olungase lutholakale luhlanganyele igumbi?","Impendulo efanele ngu:

**A: Izivakashi ezineminyaka esekuqaleni kwamashumi amabili**

Incazelo: Indaba ithi amahostela ahlalisa abantu abasha ngokuyinhloko, futhi isivakashi esivamile siseminyakeni yamashumi amabili. Ngakho-ke, izivakashi ezineminyaka esekuqaleni kwamashumi amabili ziyiluhlobo lwezivakashi ezingatholakala luhlanganyele igumbi.  Nakuba nezinye izivakashi zingatholakala, leyo yiyona evame kakhulu.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ubani ongase ahlale ehostela?","Impendulo efanele ngu **B: Abantu abathathu abaneminyaka engu-22 abahamba ndawonye**

Nazi izizathu:

*   **A: Umbhanqwana ohamba nosana:** Indaba ithi imindeni enabantwana ayijwayelekile, nakuba amanye amahostela eyavumela emakamelweni angasese. Kodwa akucaci ukuthi ikhona yini indawo yokulala ehostela.
*   **B: Abantu abathathu abaneminyaka engu-22 abahamba ndawonye:** Le ngenye yezinhlobo zabavakashi ezivame kakhulu ehostela, njengoba indaba ithi amahostela ahlalisa abantu abasha ngokuyinhloko eminyakeni yamashumi amabili.
*   **C: Umbhanqwana oseminyakeni yabo-70:** Indaba ithi ungathola nezivakashi ezindala kaningi.
*   **D: Imindeni emibili ehamba nezingane:** Indaba ithi imindeni enabantwana ayijwayelekile, nakuba amanye amahostela eyavumela emakamelweni angasese. Lokhu kuyenza into engavamile."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isitatimende esikuchaza ngokunembile ukuphonswa kwe-boomerang?","The correct answer is **D: Amanye ama-boomerang avame ukubuya**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Uma ufuna ukufunda ukuphonsa ibhumerangi ebuyela esandleni sakho, qinisekisa ukuthi unebhumerangi efanelekela ukubuya. Ama-boomerang amaningi atholakala e-Australia empeleni akuwona abuyayo."" This means some boomerangs are designed to return.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ihlale ibuya kuwe esandleni uma uyiphonsi kahle** The passage doesn't guarantee it will always return, but it does imply you need to throw a boomerang built to return.
*   **B: Ijwayeleke kakhulu kubantu bendawo kunezivakashi** The passage suggests it is a skill many tourists want to have, but it doesn't describe the commonality in locals.
*   **C: Aziziningi izindawo zokudlala iboomerang e-Australia** The passage doesn't mention playing fields."
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okusetshenziswa kakhulu lapho kwenziwa uhlobo oluthile lokudla kwesiJavanese?,"Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Ushukela kakhukhunathi**.

The passage states that ""ukudla kwaseJava kuhlanganisa izinhlobonhlobo zokudla okunongwe kalula, lapho isinongo esivelele kubantu baseJava kungamantongomane, upelepele, ushukela (ikakhulukazi ushukela waseJava kakhukhunathi) kanye nezinye izinongo ezinamakha."" This clearly indicates that coconut sugar is a prominent ingredient in Javanese cuisine.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, isifo esithathelanayo sisakazeka kanjani?","The correct answer is **A: Abantu asebenaso isifo**.

The passage states that a communicable disease is ""easily spread by being close to someone who has the disease."" This directly implies that people who already have the disease are how it spreads.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engaziwa njengebangela ukutheleleka kwesifo?","The correct answer is **A: Ukugoma**.

The passage states that contagious diseases are caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites. Vaccination is a preventative measure, not a cause.
"
Kukusiphi isibonelo lapho ukukhetha khona iwebusayithi ezokumela esikhundleni sokusebenzisa iVPN kube okwanele kulabo abayisebenzisayo?,"Impendulo efanele ngu **C: Umuntu osebenzisayo ngokuyinhloko uchezukisa isiminyaminya se-http**

Nansi incazelo:

Isitatimende sithi ama-VPN angcono kunama-proxy ewebhu ngoba ama-VPN enza umzila lonke wokuthengisa i-Inthanethi, hhayi i-http kuphela. Ngakho-ke, uma umuntu osebenzisayo edinga kuphela ukuchezukisa isiminyaminya se-http, iphroxiyaz ewebhu inganele, futhi ayikho isidingo se-VPN. Ezinye izinketho azilungile ngoba zichaza izimo lapho ama-VPN ayenza kangcono kunama-proxy ewebhu."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi kulezi zitatimende ezilandelayo mayelana namaVPN kanye newebusayithi ezokumelela okungelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **D: IVPN ingakwazi ukuchezukisa kuphela isiminyaminya se-http**.

The passage states that VPNs route *all* internet traffic, not just HTTP traffic. This directly contradicts option D, making it the false statement according to the passage.
"
Yini evumela omunye umuntu ukuba asebenzise ucingo lwenkampani ngaphandle indawo yabo?,"The correct answer is **A: Izincingo ezisebenza nge-inthanethi**.

The passage explicitly states that because the phones are connected to the Internet, one is not limited to using a company phone in their actual location.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini okungase kudingeke ukuba yenziwe ukuze kutholakale izincingo ezithile?","The correct answer is **A: Thenga inombolo yocingo yomhlaba**

The passage states ""...kufanele uthenge inombolo esebenza emhlabeni jikelele ngokuhlukile evumela amafoni we-PSTN ukuba akushayele."" which directly supports answer A. The other options are either discouraged or irrelevant."
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungakuchazi ngokunembile ukuphimisela amagama esiNtaliyani?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukuphimisela amagama amaningi kuyehluka kuyengohlamvu olulandelayo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that *only* the letters *c* and *g* change pronunciation depending on the following vowel. It *doesn't* say this is true for most words. The correct statement is C, as it refers to the potential confusion due to the letters c and g, as that pronunciation depends on the subsequent vowel.

The other options are stated accurately in the passage:

*   A: The passage states that the letter *rr* is pronounced differently from the letter *r*.
*   B: The passage states that, in Italian, most words are pronounced the same way that they are written.
*   C: The passage states that the pronunciation of letters *c* and *g* may be confusing, and that pronunciation depends on the subsequent vowel."
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo kwe-Izmir okwaba khona ngaphambi kwezinsuku zanamuhla?,"Ngokusekelwe kulwazi olunikeziwe, impendulo efanele ithi:

**E: Imakethe yangekhulu le-18, amathempeli namasonto.**

Isizathu: Incwadi iyasho ngokuqondile ukuthi i-Izmir yakhelwe ngaphambi kwezinsuku zanamuhla ""imakethe yangekhulu le-18, amathempeli namasonto"" Ngenkathi ezinye izinketho ezinjengemigwaqo emikhulu egcwele imithi, izakhiwo ezinezingilazi, izikhungo zezitolo zanamuhla, nophahla olubomvu olungokwesiko kucacile ukuthi yizici zanamuhla ze-Izmir.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungayichazi ngokunembile i-Izmir?,"The correct answer is **B: Isimo sendawo sibonakalisa amasiko aseTurkey**.

Here's why:

*   **P says:** The passage describes Izmir as having ""a very European, Mediterranean feel rather than a traditionally Turkish one."" This directly contradicts option B.
*   **A says:** The passage states that İzmir is ""surrounded by mountains.""
*   **C says:** The passage notes ""modern glass buildings and shopping districts"" along with ""18th-century market"" and ""temples and churches.""
*   **D says:** The passage says ""major port"" and ""the second biggest center""

So, option B is the only statement that misrepresents the information provided in the passage."
Igama elithi hanami libhekisela ekubukeni ini?,"The correct answer is **A: Uhlobo oluthile lwamafulawa aqhakazayo**.

The passage states, ""Ukubuka ama-cherry eqhakaza, okwaziwa ngokuthi i-hanami..."" which directly translates to ""Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami..."" Therefore, hanami refers to the viewing of cherry blossoms.
"
Ubani owenza umcimbi wokuqala onikelelwe ekubukeni izimbali eziqhakazayo?,"The correct answer is **C: Umbusi waseJapan**.

The passage states that the first cherry blossom viewing events in Japan were celebrated by the Emperor and other members of the Imperial Court.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isici esilandelayo ngeJerusalema esingeke sibakhange kakhulu abantu abavakashile?","The answer is **B: Idumela layo njengenhloko dolobha yase-Israel.**

Here's why:

*   The passage emphasizes that Jerusalem is a major tourist destination due to its religious significance, historical sites, and cultural offerings.
*   The passage explicitly states that many countries and the United Nations *do not* recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. This implies that the city's status as a capital is controversial and therefore likely not a draw for all tourists.
*   The other options (religious importance, cultural offerings, historical sites) are all presented as attractions in the passage."
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungabaliwe endabeni njengento iJerusalema elaziwa ngako?,"The correct answer is **B: Ithonya lakhona kwezepolitiki**.

The passage mentions the following about Jerusalem:

*   **A: Ulamndo wakhona omangalisayo** (Mentioned in the second sentence).
*   **C: Ukubaluleka kwakhona kwezenkolo** (Mentioned in the third sentence and throughout the passage).
*   **D: Izindawo zamasiko** (Mentioned in the last sentence).

The passage does not explicitly mention Jerusalem's political influence, only the dispute over its recognition as Israel's capital. Therefore, political influence is the correct answer."
"Ngokwale ndaba, uhlobo olunjani lwezivakashi ezingeke zizuze ekuthengeni i-Wild Card?","The correct answer is **B: Isivakashi esivakashele kuphela iKruger National Park**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Wild Card allows entry to *multiple* South African National Parks. If someone is *only* visiting Kruger National Park, the Wild Card would be unnecessary and therefore not beneficial.
*   Option A, C and D would all benefit from the Wild Card because it covers multiple parks, saves money or allows the person to visit Kruger and another park.

"
Isiphi isitatimende esingayichazi ngokunembile iKruger National Park?,"The correct answer is **C: IKruger National Park yaseNingizimu Afrika ingenane kunazo zonke.**

The passage states that Kruger National Park is one of the most popular parks in South Africa and considered its flagship park, implying it is a significant park. It doesn't suggest it is the smallest. The other options are true based on the provided text.
"
Ikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungase kubangele ubungozi ngokuqwala indawo ephakeme yentaba?,"The passage states: ""eziqaphele ezingxenyeni ezehlelayo, ikakhulukazi lapho kumanzi, njengoba kungaba yingozi ngokushesha."" This directly links wet conditions to danger.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Izimo zezulu lapho indawo imanzi.
"
Yisiphi isitatimende esingakuvezi ngokunembile ukunyuka kwentaba yaseMachu Picchu njengoba kuchazwe endabeni?,"The correct answer is **B: Ayikho indawo yokubambelela ezindaweni ezenyukelayo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""ezingxenyeni ezinomqansa izintambo zensimbi ziba uthango lokubambelelisa izandla"" (in steep sections, metal ropes act as handrails). So, there *are* handholds in the steeper sections. The statement ""Ayikho indawo yokubambelela ezindaweni ezenyukelayo"" is therefore not true according to the text.

The other options are all true according to the passage:

*   A: Ngisho nabaqwali abanesimo somzimba esihle bengaphelelwa umoya (Even climbers in good physical condition can lose their breath): The passage says ""lindela ukuphelelwa umoya"" (expect to be out of breath).
*   C: Kudingeka udlule emgedeni iphezulu (It is necessary to pass through a cave at the top): The passage says ""Kunomhume omncane eduze nesiqongo okumelwe kudlulwe kuwo"" (There is a small cave near the summit that must be passed through).
*   D: Indawo eyenyukelayo iba ingozi uma imanzi (The climbing area becomes dangerous when wet): The passage says "" uziqaphele ezingxenyeni ezehlelayo, ikakhulukazi lapho kumanzi, njengoba kungaba yingozi ngokushesha"" (be careful in the descending parts, especially when wet, as it can become dangerous quickly)."
"Ngokwendaba, yikuphi kulokhu okungesona isisekelo ekudleni kwamaMajorican?","The correct answer is **C: Ukolweni (Wheat)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Majorcan cuisine is based on **tradition, vegetables, and meat** (especially pork).
*   **Isinkwa (Bread)** is mentioned as part of ""Pa amb Oli"", a popular Majorcan dish. While not explicitly stated as a ""base"" like vegetables and meat, it's clearly a staple.
*   Though wheat isn't directly mentioned in the passage, bread (isinkwa) is a key component in Pa amb Oli and is therefore a key ingredient in Majorcan cuisine.
*   The text mentions **vegetables (imifino)** as one of the bases of the diet.

Therefore, wheat is not mentioned in the passage as one of the bases of Majorcan cuisine."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isitatimende mayelana nokudla kwehangi okungelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **B: Ihangi isebenzisa amatshe ashisayo ayatholakala eWellington**

Here's why:

*   **A: Ukusebenzisa ukushisa okuvela ematsheni ukubilisa umgodi** - This is true, the passage states ""Umgodi ushiswa ngamatshe ashisayo avela emlilweni"".
*   **C: Ukudla okushisiwe kuvame ukuphekwa kusetshenziswa ihangi** - This is true, the passage states ""I-hangi kaningi isetshenziselwa ukupheka ukudla kwakusihla okuthosiwe okungokwesiko""
*   **D: Amatshe ashisayo ihangi ayatholakala eRotorua** - This is true, the passage states ""Izindawo ezimbalwa e-Rotorua zinikela ngokudla okuphekwe ngokushisa komhlaba"".

*   **B: Ihangi isebenzisa amatshe ashisayo ayatholakala eWellington** - The passage states that hangi is done in Wellington ""okunye ukudla okunjalo kuyenziwa e-Christchurch, e-Wellington nakwezinye izindawo"", kodwa ayisisho ukuthi la matshe ashisayo atholakala khona.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungazange kubalwe njengendlela ejwayelekile yokushisisa umgodi ihangi?,"Impendulo efanele ngu **A: Igesi**

Isizathu: Indima icacisa ukuthi imigodi ye-hangi ishisiswa ngamatshe ashisayo noma ngokushisa kwemvelo okuvela ngaphansi komhlaba. Igesi ayishiwongo njengendlela yokushisisa ejwayelekile.
"
Yini engaphumela ekuqashelweni ama-monk noma ama-nun?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukugqoka into egqamile yokuzimboza.**

The passage states: ""...uma uza nesakho, ikakhulukazi esinemibala ekhanyayo, ungamomothekelwa indela lowesilisa noma elesifazane esangeweni."" This directly implies that wearing a brightly colored personal covering can result in a smile (a form of recognition) from the monks or nuns.
"
Yiziphi izingubo ezingase zingabi khona ukuze zibolekwe endlini yezindela? ,"The correct answer is **B: Izikhindi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that monasteries provide coverings for women and ""one-size-fits-all"" pants for men.
*   The passage says that women need skirts that cover their knees to borrow from the monastery.
*   The passage does not talk about loaning out long pants.
*   The passage talks about coverings being loaned to women that come unprepared."
Kunini lapho isivakashi singaba khona namathuba amaningi okubuka izinkanyezi njengoba zivakashele izindawo yaseAtarctic?,"The correct answer is **C: Phakathi nezinyanga zasebusika**.

The passage explicitly states that you can see the aurora and stars when visiting the Arctic or Antarctic *in the winter* because of the extended darkness.
"
Kunini lapho kungekona ukuhlakanipha ukusebenzisa ucingo lwesatellite kuneselula?,"The correct answer is **A: Lapho ulayini wesatellite ungase uvimbeke khona**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that a satellite phone requires a direct line of sight to the satellite to work. This means anything blocking that line of sight (like buildings, mountains, or dense forest) will prevent the phone from working. Options B, C, and D are incorrect based on the passage."
Lungafiseleka nini ucingo lwesatellite ukwedlula iselula?,"The correct answer is **B: Phakathi nokuhamba ngesikebhe** (During boat trips).

The passage states that satellite phone service is frequently used by ships. The other options are not applicable, as stated in the text."
Izinxabano ezilandelayo zobani ezaholela ekusungulweni iTransnistria Republic?,"The correct answer is **B: Ubuzwe**.

The passage states that Moldova is a ""republic of many ethnicities plagued by ethnic disputes"" and that these disputes ""led to the declaration of the self-proclaimed Transnistria Republic"". This clearly indicates that ethnic (national) disputes were the cause.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo iTransnistria Republic enakho kodwa okuhlukile kunendawo yonke yaseMaldova?  ,"The correct answer is **D: Imali**.

The passage states that Transnistria has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state. This means it has its own currency that is distinct from the rest of Moldova. The passage doesn't mention any differences in language or religion. The passage does say that it is not recognized as an independent country.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, isivakashi kufanele siyivakashele nini indawo yaseMontevideo uma sinethemba lokugwema izimo zezulu ezinomoya?","Impendulo efanele ngu **A: Phakathi nezinyanga zasebusika ZaseNyakatho Yezwe**.

Nansi incazelo:

*   Indaba ithi iMontevideo iseningizimu yeNkabazwe, ngakho-ke uma kuyisikhathi sasebusika eNyakatho, kusho ukuthi iseHlobo eMontevideo.
*   Indaba iphinde ithi ubusika eMontevideo bungaba nomoya, okusho ukuthi ihlobo eMontevideo alinawo umoya.

Ngakho-ke, uma umuntu efuna ukugwema izimo zezulu ezinomoya, kufanele avakashele iMontevideo ngesikhathi sasehlobo, okuyinto efana nezinyanga zasebusika eNyakatho Yezwe."
"Ngokwale ndaba, isivakashi kufanele sivakashele indawo yaseMontevideo uma zincamela izimo sezulu esipholile?","Impendulo efanele yi **D: Uma kuyisebusika Enyakatho Yezwe**.

Isizathu:

Indaba ithi: ""Njengoba i-Montevideo iseningizimu yeNkabazwe, kuba ihlobo lapho ngesikhathi Ingxenye eseNyakatho kusebusika kuyaphambana."" Lokhu kusho ukuthi uma umuntu efuna izimo zezulu ezipholile eMontevideo, kufanele avakashele ngenkathi kusebusika eNyakatho Yezwe (ngoba kulapho kuyoba ubusika eMontevideo).
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungahlotshaniswa nokumiswa kwabadweba izindonga, kunokuthi bacekela phansi indawo?","The passage states that graffiti in certain contexts is now seen as art, with independent graffiti artists, graffiti events, and ""legal"" walls. This implies a shift away from the destructive image.

Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: Lapho kunemicimbi yokudweba (When there are graffiti events)** - Graffiti events imply a structured, artistic, and likely permitted environment. This fits the context of graffiti being seen as art.
*   **B: Kube nezitolo (There are shops)** - This statement is not necessarily related to the text provided.
*   **C: Ukungavumeleki kwemidwebo ezindaweni zomphakathi (Prohibition of paintings in public places)** - This is the opposite of the new, more artistic and accepted context of graffiti. Prohibition suggests the traditional, negative view of graffiti as vandalism.
*   **D: Omaka abangafundeki (Illegible markings)** - Illegible markings is vandalism, which would not be associated with independent artists.

Therefore, the best answer is **C: Ukungavumeleki kwemidwebo ezindaweni zomphakathi (Prohibition of paintings in public places)** because that aligns with the perception of graffiti as vandalism rather than art.
"
Yisiphi isici somculo abanye ababa khona kuwo abakubheka njengengxenye ebalulekile kulokho okusuke kwenzeka?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukukhempa endaweni**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kweminye imikhosi, iningi lababakhona emkhosini womculo linquma ukukanisa kuleyo ndawo, futhi ababakhona abaningi bakubona kuyingxenye edingekayo yokuhlanganyela."" (At some festivals, most music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and many attendees view it as a necessary part of the experience.)
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini okufanele bayibheke njengebalulekile abafika kule micimbi uma befuna ukukhempa eduzane nalapho kudlalwa khona umculo?","The correct answer is **D: Ukufika kusasenesikhathi**.

The passage states: ""Uma ufuna ukubona okwenzekayo useduze kuzomelwe ufike masinya ukuze uthole indawo yokukamisa eduze nomculo."" This directly translates to ""If you want to see what's happening up close you have to arrive early to get a camping spot close to the music."" Therefore, arriving early is important.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi izivakashi okufanele zikugweme lapho zifuna indawo enobumnandi enyakatho neNew Mexico?","The correct answer is **B: Izindawo zokuphuza edolobheni elincane**.

The passage specifically warns that small town bars in northern New Mexico are not always suitable for tourists because of the problem of drunk drivers in the area.
"
"Ngokwa lendaba, kukuphi lapho emaningi amathuba okuba isivakashi sithole khona indawo eyaziwayo yobumnandi enyakatho neNew Mexico?","The correct answer is **C: Endaweni yokugembula eseduze neSante Fe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that while remote pueblos are isolated, the casinos near Albuquerque and Santa Fe offer entertainment.
*   It then states that the ""bigger ones are near Albuquerque and Santa Fe."" This suggests that the entertainment options are more likely to be found at casinos closer to these cities.
*   Since the question asks about northern New Mexico, and Santa Fe is in northern New Mexico, this makes the answer C the most suitable one.
*   The passage also states that taverns in small towns are not always suitable for tourists. This makes answer D incorrect.
*   Answer A is incorrect as the passage doesn't provide details on the duration it takes to get to Albuquerque from the gambling area in question.
*   Answer B is incorrect as the passage states that the pueblos are remote."
Izivakashi ezikhathazeke ngemali ezizoyisebenzisa zingase zifune ukugwema luphi uhlobo lweziphuzo?,"The text states that fruit juices are expensive. Therefore, the answer is:

D: Ijusi yezithelo
"
"Ngokwale ndawo echazwe kule ndaba, yibuphi utshwala obungase buphambaniswe umuntu odayisayo?","The correct answer is **D: Flat White**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kubantu base-Australia, umcabango wekhofi 'elinobisi oluthunqiswe ngomusi' awujwayelekile."" A flat white is a coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk, but the milk is steamed to a very thin, ""flat"" consistency with very little foam. Therefore, this is unfamiliar to Australians, as described in the passage, and the other options are not.

*   **A: Short Black** - The passage states that a small cup of coffee is an ""espresso."" A short black is another term for an espresso, so this drink would not throw the person off.
*   **B: Number One** - The passage describes 'Uhamba Phambili', as a ""Number One"" local beer.
*   **C: Sauvignon Blanc yaseNew Zealand** - The passage states that wines from New Zealand are good to drink, so this is a drink familiar to the person."
"Njengoba lahlala amakhulu weminyaka amathathu, isikhathi samakholoni saqalwa yiliphi iqembu?","The correct answer is **D: Spaniards**.

The passage states: ""Ngekhulu lama-16 leminyaka iParaguay... yaba khona ngenxa yokuhlangana kwabanqobi baseSpeyini... AbaseSpeyini baqala isikhathi sobukoloni esathatha amakhulu amathathu eminyaka.""  This clearly identifies the Spanish as the group that initiated the three-century long colonial period.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iyiphi indlela enhle kakhulu yokwenza umuntu waseFrance afudumale?","The passage explicitly states that the best way to make Parisian people warm up to you is to behave like a ""bien élevé"" person, which means well-mannered. This directly translates to being respectful.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Ukuba nenhlonipho**.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okuyinto eshiwo abanye enganembile ngabantu basePherisi?","According to the passage, the following are inaccurately attributed to Parisians:

*   **A: Ukuzikhukhumeza (Arrogance)**
*   **B: Ukuba luhlaza (Rudeness)**
*   **C: Ukuzidla (Conceit)**

While the passage doesn't explicitly mention ""Ukugcwala ukudlala"" (Playfulness) or ""Ukuba namawala"" (Impatience), it *does* explicitly state that the perception of Parisians as arrogant, rude, and conceited is often an unfair characterization.

Therefore, the best answer is **A, B, and C.** Although I can only select one answer, this is an instance in which multiple answers can be correct.
"
Iyiphi inzuzo yokugibela iFirst Class kuyiMetroRail yaseKapa?,"The correct answer is **B: Alinabo abantu abaningi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""MetroPlus inethezeke kakhudlwana futhi ayigcwali abantu kodwa ibiza kakhudlwana""
*   MetroPlus class is also referred to as first class.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The MetroPlus/First class area is near the Cape Town city.
*   **C:** It is more expensive than a Third class ticket
*   **D:** The MetroPlus/First class fare is more expensive than a Third class ticket."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini ekhona ezitimeleni zaseKapa ezithatha abantu abasebenzayo?","The correct answer is **D: Amagumbi womabili eFirst Class neThird Class**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that all trains have both MetroPlus (essentially first class) and Metro (essentially third class) carriages.
*   Option A is incorrect because it says the Metro car is not crowded, and the passage suggests otherwise.
*   Option B is incorrect because the Metro car is cheaper than the MetroPlus car.
*   Option C is incorrect because the passage only discusses two classes."
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo amagciwane ezilwane okungabonakali ukuthi engakwenza?,"The passage states:

*   ""Izilokazane zingakonakalisa ukudla, zicasule, noma okubi nakakhulu zenze kusigulise, zisakaze ubuthi, noma zisakaze izifo."" (Pests can spoil food, annoy, or worse make you sick, spread poison, or spread diseases.)
*   ""izilwane eziyingozi ezingalimaza noma zibulale umuntu ngamandla"" (dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person by force)

The passage doesn't mention pests causing rashes or causing you to be immune. It explicitly mentions the ability to spread infections and cause harm.

Therefore, the answer is **B: Ukuvukelwa yizigulo ezingakuphathi kahle (Causing you to be immune)**.
"
Engathengwa kuphi amakhadi okufona akhokhelwayo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ezitolo ezisemakhoneni** (Corner stores).

The passage explicitly states: ""Noma iziphi izitolo ezincane zigcwele ngezinhlobonhlobo ezididayo zamakhadi wefoni akhokhelwa kusengaphambili..."" (Any corner stores are filled with a confusing variety of prepaid phone cards...)
"
Yiziphi ezinye izinzuzo ezingcono ezinikezwa kulamakhadi?,"Impendulo efanele ngu **B: Ngokusebenzisa inombolo yamahhala**.

Isizathu: Umusho uthi ukufinyelela kula masevisi kuvame ukutholakala ngezinombolo zocingo zamahhala ezingafonelwa ezingcingweni eziningi ngaphandle kokukhokhela. Lokhu kusho ukuthi inzuzo enkulu ukusebenzisa inombolo yamahhala ukufinyelela lawa masevisi.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yiziphi izihlahla ezilandelayo ayivamile kwipaki ezilwane ePlitvice Lakes?","Impendulo efanele yi **B: Isihlahla se-okhi**

Incazelo: Indaba isho ukuthi ipaki line-beech, i-spruce kanye nezihlahla ze-fir. Alisho ukuthi linezihlahla ze-okhi noma zomusayipuresi. Yingakho i-okhi ayivamile kwipaki lezwe lePlitvice Lakes.
"
Iziphi izilwane ezingandile ezilandelayo ongazithola esiqiwini esisePlitvice Lakes?,"The correct answer is **D: I-Capercaillie**.

The passage explicitly mentions the capercaillie as one of the rare animals found in Plitvice Lakes National Park. The others are not mentioned in the text.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, amakhodi esifunda asiza ngani kahle kahle?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuqondisa ezokudayisa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Injongo yangempela ukwenza lezo zinkampani zilawule kakhudlwana izimakethe zazo; konke kumayelana nokwenza inzuzo."" This directly implies that region codes are used to control markets, which is the same as directing commerce (ezokudayisa).
*   The passage argues that region codes do **not** prevent illegal copying (so C and D are incorrect). It even states the opposite is true: ""empeleni, amakhodi wendawo awasebenzi nakancane ekukopeni okungekho emthethweni.""
*   The passage does not imply that region codes help people copy disks. In fact, it implies the opposite."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi okulandelayo okungamanga ngokuphathelene namakhodi esifundsa abhebhezelwa izinkampani zabezindaba?","The passage claims that media companies falsely claim region codes are for ""preventing piracy."" It also states that region codes ""don't work at all in stopping illegal copying."" The passage *does* claim the *real* purpose is to gain more market control and increase profits.

Based on this, the answer is:

*   **B: Kusiza ekugwemeni ukukopisha okungemthetho** (Helps in avoiding unlawful copying)

The passage explicitly states this is a lie propagated by the media companies."
"Lapho ufika nedaweni yakini, iyiphi inqubo ngokujwayelekile engekho ngokomthetho?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuhlolwa kwabantu abathuthela kwelinye izwe** (Immigration physicals).

The passage states that immigration physicals *can* be done upon arrival, implying they are generally allowed, though logistically complex. The rest of the options all relate to customs and declaring goods, which the passage emphasizes as being difficult and needing attention. Therefore, the process generally *not* illegal (but perhaps difficult to avoid upon arrival) is the immigration physical.
"
Yikuphi okulandelayo okufanele ukwazi ngaphambi kokuba ufike ezweni lakini?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukuthi kukhona yini okuphethe okungavumelekile (Whether you have anything that is prohibited).**

The passage emphasizes knowing what you are allowed and not allowed to bring into the country and declaring anything questionable to the authorities. This directly relates to having something prohibited.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ubuningi bani obuvumela abaqwalayo ukuba baqhubeke bethola izindlela ezintsha phakathi neCochamó Valley?","The correct answer is **D: Izindonga** (Walls).

The passage states: ""Abagibeli abavela kuzo zonke izingxenye zomhlaba bayaqhubeka ngokuthola imizila emisha phakathi kwezindawo ezingapheli ezingaba **izindonga**."" This directly indicates that the abundance of walls allows climbers to continue discovering new routes.
"
"Ngokokwaziswa okunikezwe kule ndaba, obani abakwazi ukuhamba kakhulu baklaye eNingizimu Yezwe?","The correct answer is **A: SkyTeam**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ayikho inhlangano yezindiza ehlanganisa zonke izindlela ezintathu zokuya ngaphesheya kwezilwandle ezinkulu eNingizimu neNkabazwe (futhi IqembuIsibhakabhaka alihlanganisi lezi zindlela)."" This explicitly says SkyTeam doesn't cover all the routes.
*   The passage says, ""Nokho, Inhlangano yeNkanyezi ihlanganisa yonke into ngaphandle kweNingizimu Phasifiki esempumalanga kusuka eSantiago de Chile kuya eTahiti, okuyindawo yokubalekela Yezwe elilodwa leLATAM."" This explicitly says Star Alliance and LATAM Oneworld provide routes.
*   The passage notes ""Indiza ayikhona nje ukuphela kwento ongayikhetha uma ufuna ukudabula izilwandle zaseNingizimu Pacific kanye nogu olusentshonalanga yeNingizimu Melika."" This implies that the South Pacific is not the only thing to choose if you want to go across the ocean near the South Pacific, meaning it doesn't provide enough choices to travel the most.

Therefore, since SkyTeam *doesn't* cover all the routes in the Southern Hemisphere, they are the ones with the *least* coverage."
Imuphi umfelandawonye wamabhanoyi ohamba indawo encane olwandle uklaye iNingizimu Yezwe?,"The answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that ""Star Alliance covers everything except the Eastern South Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti"". This means it covers more of the Southern Hemisphere than the other alliances mentioned.
*   The passage explicitly mentions that the only non-airplane option to cross the Pacific and the west coast of South America isn't an option as the question is only about airline alliances."
Iyiphi inhlangano ebukisa abantu indawo eyalandela iGlobal Running Tours?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Go Running Tours**.

The text states ""I-Go Running Tours eyalandela i-Global Running Tours..."" which directly answers the question.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iGo Running Tour yasiza ekuxhumaniseni izinhlangano ezibuka indawo ezingaki?","The correct answer is **D: Ezintathu**.

The passage mentions:

*   Go Running Tours (the main entity) was formed from:
    *   Barcelona Running Tours
    *   Copenhagen
    *   Prague Running Tours

Thus, Go Running Tours helped connect three sightseeing companies."
Yini isivakashi okufanele sikwenze uma sinethemba lokubona ngokucacile isilwane ingulele?,"The correct answer is **C: Sebenzisa izipopolo**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Amabhubesi, izingulule kanye nezingwe ziyexwaya futhi uzozibona kangcono ngezingilazi zokubuka kude.""  Ingulule is an ingwe (cheetah) so ukusebenzisa izipopolo (using binoculars) is the best option for seeing a cheetah clearly.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, isiphi isilwane isivakashi okungenzeka sihlangane naso phakathi nokuvakasha kuyisafari ngemoto?","The correct answer is **B: Izindlulamithi**

The passage states: ""Ezinye izilwane, njengezindlovu kanye nezindlulamithi, zithanda ukusondela ezimotweni...""
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini enganciphisa izindleko zokubona indawo?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuthola iqembu labantu abazobuka indawo**.

The passage states that tours are cheaper in larger groups, so forming a group (especially of four to six people) will result in lower individual prices.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ubani ongase athola amanani amahle okubuka indawo?","The best answer is **D: Iqembu labantu abahlanu**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that tours are cheaper for larger groups, specifically mentioning groups of *four to six people*. A group of five falls perfectly within this range.
*   Option A is incorrect because even though the passage mentions visitors being ushered around to fill up cars, it is not stated or implied that these visitors get a great rate.
*   Option B is incorrect because even though it is a group of people, a group of three is below the ideal range.
*   Option C is incorrect because even though it is a group of people, a group of two is below the ideal range."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini eyaba nesandla ekuqashelweni kwendawo yaseSan Francisco?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuba khona kwezinto njalo ezihlukahlukene zobuciko nezabezindaba**

The passage states: ""Ukubukiswa kwalo njalo emculweni, kumafilimu, ezincwadini kanye nasemasikweni athandwayo kwenze idolobha kanye nezici ezibonwa ngalo izwe zaziwe emhlabeni wonke."" This directly supports option A.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi kulezi zitatimende ezilandelayo mayelana neSan Francisco esingelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **D: Ezomnotho sezizonke zincike kakhulu ezivakashini.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states the San Francisco economy is a mix, with technology, government, finance, trade, and tourism all being major sectors. It doesn't say it is overly reliant on tourism

The other options are true based on the passage:

*   **A: Isifakwe kakhulu kumamuvi kanye nasezincwadini:** The passage mentions frequent portrayals in music, movies, literature, and popular culture.
*   **B: Kwandile ukudla kwase-Asia okuhlotshisiwe:** The passage states it is one of the premier destinations in the nation for some Asian cuisine.
*   **C: Maningi amahhotela kanye nezikhungo zemihlangano:** The passage mentions being surrounded by large tourist infrastructures with hotels and convention facilities."
"Ngokwale ndaba, izivakashi ezinjani ezingase zingazuzi ekusebenziseni izinkonzo zama-ejenti?","The correct answer is **D: Isivakashi esikhetha ukubhukha izindali eziyisamba**.

Here's why:

*   The passage discusses the benefits of using travel agencies, especially for booking hotels, transport, and packages. While it notes an agent can help you keep a booking while you handle things such as Visas, it doesn't necessarily discourage travellers who haven't yet got a visa from using an agent, so it makes C incorrect.
*   The passage does not refer to 'an indecisive traveller' nor to 'a traveller who likes to do everything by themselves', so A and B are incorrect.
*   The passage explicitly states that travel agencies specialize in booking certain types of accommodations (hotels) and arranging transport, whereas it notes that you aren't able to book certain types of accommodations through a travel agency, such as camping areas.
*   The passage does not refer to auction sites. So someone who likes to book bulk deals on auction sites will not be benefitting from a travel agent."
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungashiwongo endabeni njengenzuzo yokubhuka usebenzisa ama-ejenti okuvakasha?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukusheshisa amadokhuyumenti okuvakasha**.

The passage discusses the following benefits of using travel agents:

*   Peace of mind knowing you'll have accommodation.
*   Discounts and special deals with hotels.
*   All-inclusive packages (e.g., breakfast, airport transfers, flight + hotel).
*   Holding a reservation while you finalize travel details.

The passage does *not* mention travel agents helping to expedite travel documents like visas.

"Ngokwale ndaba, yini izicelo zabahumushi abahumusha ngaso leso sikhathi abangakwazi ukuyenza?","The correct answer is **D: Ukuhumusha ngokunembe ngamaphesenti angu-100 ngaso sonke isikhathi** (Translating with 100 percent accuracy all the time).

The passage specifically states that translation apps ""can make completely inaccurate translations"" and only offer ""near-accurate translations,"" indicating that perfect accuracy is not guaranteed. The other options are mentioned as capabilities of these apps.
"
Yini evumela ukuba ukuhumushwa kwento kungenziwa ku-inthanethi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukudawuniloda idatha yolimi**.

The passage states that Google Translate allows for offline translation ""ngemva kokudawuniloda idatha yolimi olufunwayo"" (after downloading the desired language data). This directly answers the question of what allows for offline translation.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungasusi ukuwa kwamaqhwa?,"Based on the passage, all the options listed (except one) can trigger an avalanche:

*   **B: Abantu:** The passage explicitly states that human activity can cause avalanches.
*   **C: Ilanga:** The passage says the sun warming the snow can trigger an avalanche.
*   **D: Ukuwa kwamanye amaqhwa:** The passage states that additional snowfall can trigger an avalanche.

The remaining option is:
*   **A: Iqhwa elinamathelayo:** The passage says that because ice is sticky, it needs to be ""triggered"" to fall. Sticky ice is what makes ice avalanches need to be triggered in the first place.

**Therefore, the correct answer is A: Iqhwa elinamathelayo.**
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okwehla njengeqhwa eliwayo?","Based on the passage, the correct answer is **C: Umthamo omkhulu weqhwa endaweni ewumqansa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that avalanches occur when areas hold enough snow and *more* snow falls. This implies a large amount of snow is needed to begin with.
*   The passage specifically mentions that the snow is sticky and needs to be dislodged, but it makes no implication that human interaction makes up a requirement for snow to fall."
"Ngokwale ndaba, ukhari usekelwe kuziphi izithako?","The correct answer is **B: Emakhambini kanye nezinongo**.

The passage states: ""Ukhari yisidlo esisuselwa kumakhambi nezinongo..."". This directly indicates that herbs and spices are the base of a curry. While other ingredients like yogurt, coconut milk, meat, and vegetables are mentioned, they are used *in addition* to the herbs and spices, not as the base itself.
"
"Ezifundeni ezithile, ubisi lwekhukhunathi ngezinye izikhathi lusetshenziswa esikhundleni sasiphi isithako sikakhari?","The correct answer is **C: Iyogathi**.

The passage states: ""izindawo ezimaphakathi nezwe zaseNyakatho neNdiya nePakistan, i-yogathi ivamise ukusetshenziswa ezitshuliwni; eNingizimu neNdiya kanye nasezindaweni ezinye ezisogwini zezwekazi, ubisi lukakhukhunathi luvamise ukusetshenziswa."" This clearly shows that coconut milk is used as a substitute for yogurt.
"
Kungani ukuphambuka eTransantarctic Mountains kudinga ukuba uye ethafeni?,"The correct answer is **C: Imishini ekhethekile ayikwazi ukuhamba kahle**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""These are not very maneuverable so the route has to veer far around the Transantarctic Mountains to get onto the plateau.""  ""These"" refers to the specially built tractors and sleds. The sentence explicitly states that their lack of maneuverability is the reason for detouring around the mountains to reach the plateau.
"
"NgaseSouth Pole Traverse, yini emakwe ngamafulege?","The correct answer is **C: Imisele evulekile egcwele iqhwa**.

The passage states the route is ""iqhwa elihlangene eligcwele imisele ebekiswe ngamafulegi."" This directly translates to open trenches filled with ice being marked by flags.
"
Yini engazange ivezwe endabeni njengento izivakashi okufanele zikuqaphele lapho sibuka indawo yaseNingizimu Afrika?,"Impendulo efanele ithi: **C: Azinzile cisho wonke amazwe akhelene neNingizimu Afrika**

Incazelo:

Nakuba indaba ithi i-Afrika eseNingizimu igxilile, futhi amazwe angomakhelwane ayihluke kakhulu. Kubalulekile ukuhlola ngaphambi kohambo ukuthi yiziphi izinto eziphuthumayo ezidingeka ezweni ngalinye. Izinketho A, B, no-D zonke zivame ukukhethwa njengoba zikhulunywa endabeni.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engabhekwa njengeseluleko esibi ezivakashini ezifuna ukuhlola iNingizimu Afrika zisebenzisa imoto?","The correct answer is **D: Akuwona wonke amazwe akhelene neNingizimu Afrika okuhle ukuwavakashela**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ukukhumbula njengoba uhlela ukuthi nakuba i-Afrika eseNingizimu igxilile akuwona wonke amazwe angomakhelwane anjalo"". This implies that some neighboring countries might not be as stable or safe, suggesting caution when planning to visit them.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungazange kushiwo kule ndaba ngokuphathelene nobungozi bokushiya isikhwama sakho singagadiwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Zingase ziphanjaniswe nezomunye umuntu**.

The passage mentions:

*   **A: Zingase zebiwe** (Izikhwama ezinganakwanga zitshontshwa kalula...)
*   **B: Ungazi ungase ufakelwe izidakamizwa esikhwameni** (Ungazithola usetshenziswa njengomuntu othwala izidakamizwa ngaphandle kolwazi lwakho...)
*   **D: Abezomthetho bengazibheka njengento engaba ibhomu** (...zingadonsa ukunaka kweziphathimandla eziqaphele ukusongelwa ngamabhomu.)

The passage does not mention the risk of bags being mistaken for someone else's.
"
Yini engazange ishiwo endabeni mayelana nokuphatha izidakamizwa?,"The correct answer is **D: Iziphathimandla zingase zibambe isikhwama sakho ngisho noma izidakamizwa ungaziphethe**

Here's why:

* **A:** The passage explicitly mentions that ""Amanye amazwe anezindlela zokujezisa ezinonya kakhulu ngisho nakubantu abaqalayo ukuphula umthetho; lezi zingahlanganisa izigwebo zasejele zeminyaka engaphezu kuka-10 noma ukufa."" So, this *is* stated in the passage.
* **B:** The entire passage revolves around emphasizing the need for extra caution when traveling abroad. So, this *is* stated in the passage.
* **C:** The passage states that ""Izinja ezithungatha izidakamizwa zingasetshenziswa nganoma isiphi isikhathi ngaphandle kwesaziso."" Which is similar to what the answer is stating. So, this *is* stated in the passage.
* **D:** The passage never states authorities may take your bag even if you do not have drugs in it, however the passage does say that ""Izikhwama ezinganakwanga zitshontshwa kalula futhi zingadonsa ukunaka kweziphathimandla eziqaphele ukusongelwa ngamabhomu.""
"
Yiluphi uhlobo lukatshwala olungazange lubalwe njengento ongazama ukuzenzela yona ekhaya uma uhlezi uphumule?,"The passage mentions making juice, coffee, and tea at home. It doesn't mention making beer.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Ubhiya** (Beer).
"
Yikuphi okulandelayo okufanele ukuvakashele phakathi nesikhathi sokuhlala ekhaya uma idolobha okulo laziwa ngenxa yeziphuzo ezenziwa khona?,"The correct answer is **C: Izindawo zokuphuza ongajwayele ukuya kuzo**.

The passage specifically suggests visiting ""izinkantini noma izindlini zokuphuzela emiphakathini ongavamisanga ukuya kuyo"" if your city has a distinct drinking culture. The other options are mentioned in the passage, but not as something specific to visit when staying in a city known for its drinks.
"
Izithombe zamajuba zikuphi nendawo?,"The correct answer is **B: Emagcekeni esonto**

The passage states: ""Egcekeni lesonto, kunemifanekiso yemabula ethakazelisayo yamajuba phezu kwamathuna amanye."" This directly places the dove sculptures in the churchyard (egcekeni lesonto).
"
Yiluphi uhlobo lwe-visa olungase ludingwe umuntu ukuze aveze uvufakazi ukuthi unemali eyanele ukuzisekela?,"The correct answer is **D: Ivisa yabafundi**

The passage specifically states that student visas require proof of funds for at least the first year of study.
"
Ubani ongase adinge ukwenezela isikhathi kuyivisa yakhe?,"Impendulo efanele ngu **C: Umfundi ofunda phesheya**

Incazelo: Isahluko sigqamisa ukuthi abafundi abaya phesheya bayodinga ivisa ehlukile futhi enezidingo ezengeziwe uma beqhathaniswa nezivakashi ezijwayelekile noma abantu abahambela ibhizinisi. Lokhu kusho ukuthi bangadinga ukunweba ivisa yabo uma behlala isikhathi eside kunaleso esivunyelwe yivisa yesivakashi esijwayelekile.
"
Kunini lapho kufanele uqaphele khona omiyane?,"The correct answer is **C: Ehlathini lemvula**.

The passage specifically states that you need to be careful of mosquitoes, *particularly* if you decide to go to a rainforest. While summer is mentioned as a general time to be wary of mosquitoes, the focus is on the rainforest.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini okufanele uyigweme ukuyenza ukuze ugweme umiyane lapho ushayela ehlathini elimanzi?","The correct answer is **A: Ukushiya izicabha zemoto zivulwe isikhathi eside** (Leaving the car doors open for a long time).

The passage explicitly states that opening car doors for even a few seconds in a rainforest is enough time for mosquitoes to enter the car. Therefore, avoiding leaving the car doors open for extended periods is crucial to prevent mosquitoes from getting inside.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isitatimende kulezi ezilandelayo mayelana neSundarbans okungelona iqiniso?","The incorrect statement is **B: Uhhafu wayo yonke indawo umbozwe ixhaphozi**.

The passage states that one-third of the Sundarbans area is covered by wetlands/water bodies, not one half. All the other options are stated as facts within the text.
"
Iyiphi ingxenye yehlathi ephakathi nendawo yaseNdiya?,"The correct answer is **A: ISundarbans National Park**.

The passage states: ""Ingxenye yehlathi elisensimini yabaseNdiya libizwa ngokuthi i-Ipaki Lesizwe i-Sundarbans"".
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ubani ongase abe nokuqonda okulinganiselwe kolimi lwesiNgisi?","The correct answer is **D: Abantu asebekhulile ngokweminyaka**.

The passage states that in many countries, ""you can expect limited knowledge – particularly among younger people."" This implies that older people are *less* likely to have limited English knowledge than younger people, making D the correct answer.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engase ibe nzima ukuyiphimisela?","The correct answer is **B: Amakheli**.

The passage specifically states that addresses are often difficult to pronounce correctly: ""This is especially true of addresses, those are often difficult to pronounce correctly.""
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isibonelo esingasiza umuntu ovakashayo ohlele ukuthatha ibhasi esuka esiteshini sesigodi se-inter?","The best answer is **B: Umuntu ovakashile ubheke eBumthang futhi udinga ukuhamba ngo-7.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that buses towards Jakar/Bumthang, especially, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

*   A: While buying a ticket in advance is good advice, the passage doesn't particularly emphasize this for Jakar specifically.
*   C: Paro is suggested as a place you would travel to using a shared Taxi, which is the fastest and most confortable.
*   D: While going to East, the visitor is on time according to the text, there is nothing special about this information."
Yikuphi okungaba icebiso elihle ngomuntu ovakashile ofuna ukuhamba aye empumalanga esuka ngebhasi esigodini sase-inter?,"The best advice for someone wanting to travel east by inter-district bus is **B: Thenga ithikithi kusengaphambili (Buy a ticket in advance).**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Njengoba amabhasi esifunda ngokuvamile egcwala, kuyatuseka ukuthi uthenge ithikithi ezinsukwini ezimbalwa ngaphambili."" (Since inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.)

Let's look at why the other options are not as good:

*   **A: Amabhasi ahamba kuphela ngemva kuka-8:30:** This is incorrect. The passage says many buses *especially those going east* leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
*   **C: Amabhasi amaningi ahamba phakathi nosuku:** While technically true, the passage indicates the *most* buses leave early in the morning, specifically for eastern destinations. This is not the best advice.
*   **D: Utekisi elihlanganyelwano lingaba indlela enhle yokuhamba:** Shared taxis are good for *nearby* locations like Paro and Punakha. The question specifies traveling to an inter-district valley *east*, which implies a longer distance where a bus might be more suitable and economical. While shared taxis are an option, booking a bus ticket early is more relevant to the question."
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungayichazi kahle iTimbuktu?,"The correct answer is **C: Akufikeki khona ngebhanoyi**.

The passage explicitly states that Timbuktu ""has an airport"". Therefore, it *is* accessible by plane. The other statements are supported by the text:

*   **A: Inomthelela omningi wase-Arabh kunezwe lonke:** The passage states, ""Idolobha lihlukile ngokuphelele kwamanye amadolobha ezwe, ngoba linomoya wase-Arabhiya kakhulu ukudlula owaseAfrika."" which implies a stronger Arabic influence than the rest of the country.

*   **B: Ukukhahlamezwa inhlupheko:** The passage states ""iTimbuktu idolobha eliphundlekile"" which translates to Timbuktu is a dilapidated city. This means it's likely to have high levels of poverty.

*   **D: Isalokhu iyindawo ekhangayo kubantu abanelukuluku:** The passage states, ""...nakuba idumela lalo lilenza lithandwe izivakashi"". which translates to ""...although its reputation makes it popular with tourists"". Tourists are generally curious, so it is therefore appealing to curious people.
"
Yiliphi iqiniso elilandelayo elimayelana neTimbuktu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ibhanoyi liyakwazi ukufika kule ndawo**.

The passage states: ""... futhi **inesikhumulo sezindiza**."" This directly confirms that planes can reach Timbuktu.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Indawo ecebile kunokuba mpofu:** The passage describes Timbuktu as a ""faded city,"" which implies the opposite of being wealthy.
*   **C: Inezinto ezimbalwa zase-Afrika kunamadolobha azungezile:** The passage says ""Idolobha lihlukile ngokuphelele kwamanye amadolobha ezwe, ngoba linomoya wase-Arabhiya kakhulu ukudlula owaseAfrika,"" which means it is less African than other cities in the country.
*   **D: Idolobha elingasazikhangi izivakashi:** The passage states ""...nakuba idumela lalo lilenza lithandwe izivakashi..."" contradicting this option."
Ahlelwa nini Olympic asehlobo kwasekuqalenni? ,"Impendulo efanele ngu **D: NgoJulayi 2020**

Umbhalo uthi izinkampani eziningi zokukhansela ngenxa ye-coronavirus azifinyeleli kuJulayi 2020, okuwukuthi lapho ama-Olimpiki ayehlelwe ukuba abe khona."
"Ngokwale ndaba, kungasiphi isikhathi lapho umoya onjengefanela uba isivunguvungu?","The correct answer is **D: Ngemva kokuthinta umhlabathi**

The passage states: ""...ziqala njengamafanela ayehlayo emafwini wesiphepho, bese ziba “izivunguvungu” lapho zifika phansi."" This clearly indicates that a funnel cloud becomes a tornado once it touches the ground.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okuyisici esinembile mayelana nesivunguvungu?,"Impendulo efanele ngu **B: Sivame ukuhamba nezinto ezisindayo**.

Nakhu isizathu sokuthi kungani:

*   **A: Kuhlale kwenza umoya oyisivinini esingamamayela nagu100 kuya ku-200 ngehora:** Nakuba isivunguvungu singaba nomoya onjalo, umbhalo uthi ""ngokuvamile"" awusho njalo.
*   **C: Ziba njengefanela lapho nje sithinta phansi:** Umbhalo uthi ziqala njengamafanela bese ziba ""izivunguvungu"" lapho zifika phansi.
*   **D: Kuzungeza ingxenye leyo ephusha umoya phansi:** Umbhalo uthi ""imunyela umoya oseduze phakathi kanye naphezulu"", okuphikisana nemibono esiyinikiwe."
"Ngokwale ndaba, umuntu ovakashayo kufanele alithole kuphi icebiso mayelana nesixazululo sezepolitiki edolobheni alivakashelayo?","The passage states: ""The advice is merely a brief summary of the political situation in a single country. The opinions expressed are generally cursory, common, and very simplistic when compared to the detailed information available elsewhere.""

It suggests that government advice is *not* the best source for detailed political information. However, the passage *doesn't* explicitly state where a traveler *should* get that information.

Looking at the options:

*   **A: Kuhulumeni wezwe azobe elivakashele** - The passage says government advice is too simplistic.
*   **B: Emibonweni ekhona endaweni yezivakashi yokuthola usizo** - The passage does not make reference to tourist assistance or travel tours.
*   **C: Ezakhamuzini zezwe umuntu azobe elivakashele** - The passage does not mention talking to the citizens.
*   **D: Kuhulumeni wabo** - The first line of the passage states, ""You may also wish to check the advice of governments other than your own, but advice is tailored to their citizens."" While still too simplistic, the passage does not state that the traveler should or should not refer to their own government.

Given that the passage is critical of government advice being *too simple*, and mentions that there is *more detailed information available elsewhere*, it doesn't offer a specific alternative. Therefore, the answer is **D: Kuhulumeni wabo**.
"
"Ezimweni zonikeza izivakashi usizo, yini umuntu wakwelinye izwe angase ayilindele?","The correct answer is **A: Ukukhanseleka komushwalense okuthintekile** and **C: Umshwalense wempilo othintekile.**

The passage states: ""uma izwe ozolivakashela lithola izixwayiso zokuphepha ezingokomthetho, umshwalense wakho wohambo wempilo noma umshwalense wakho wokukhansela uhambo ungathinteka."" This directly supports options A and C.

Option B is incorrect because the passage says government advice is usually an *oversimplification* of the political situation.

Option D is incorrect for the same reason as B; the passage says the advice is *not* detailed.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, uhlobo olunjani lohambo olungadinga ubhukhe ukuba uthole usizo kuyi-ejent yezokuvakasha?","Ngokwesigatshana, impendulo efanele ithi:

**C: Uhambo oluzoba nezinkinga zolimi**

Isigatshana sithi umenzeli wokuvakasha ukhetho oluhle lohambo ""oludlula ulwazi lwangaphambilini lomhambi lwemvelo, isiko, ulimi noma amazwe."" Lokhu kusho ukuthi uhambo olungenzeka lube nezinkinga zolimi luzoba yisimo lapho usizo lomenzeli wokuvakasha lungaba usizo kakhulu.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, isiphi isibonelo ovakashile angazuza kuzo ngokuphathelene nosizo lwe-ejenti yezokuvakasha?","The correct answer is **B: Lapho ovakashile enesithakazelo sokubhukha uhambo okokuqala ngqa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that travel agents are a good option for travel that goes beyond a traveler's previous knowledge of nature, culture, language, or countries. This aligns with someone booking a trip for the first time, as they likely have limited prior knowledge or experience in travel planning.
*   The passage also suggests that travel agents specialize in different types of travel. So, a first-time traveler can benefit from the agent's expertise in choosing and booking the right type of trip for their needs."
"Ngokwale ndaba elandelayo, yini engasiza ovakashile agweme ukuphoxeka kuyilapho evakashele indawo entsha?","Impendulo efanele ngu **B: Ukuzimisela ukuzama ukudla ukudla ongakujwayela**.

Here's why:

*   **P (The passage)** explicitly recommends using a camp cot or hammock when camping to protect yourself from snakes, scorpions, and other animals.
*   **A:** The passage highlights the importance of prioritizing Western practices, hotels, food, and services when you arrive to help you get used to things so you would not be aware of the local animals because you are more isolated from them.
*   **B:** The passage explicitly recommends spending money on Western-style ways of doing things, hotels, food, and services, not to avoid too much food.
*   **D:** The passage explicitly recommends considering spending more money on Western-style ways of doing things, hotels, food, and services to help you get used to the environment."

The passage advises *against* sleeping on mattresses or mats on the floor, especially when camping in unfamiliar areas. It suggests spending money on alternatives like a camp cot or hammock. The other options (Western food, high-quality services, and high-quality hotels) are mentioned as things to spend money on to ease the transition.
"
"Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungaba kuhle kumuntu onenqubomgomo ofuna ikhophi yakhe naye ezobasemshinini wezobuchwepheshe, kodwa engenayo i-inthanethi?","The correct answer is **C: Ukugcina ikhophi igciniwe kuyilaptop yabo**.

Here's why:

*   **The prompt stipulates that the person does not have internet access**
*   The question asks for what is most effective for a traveler who does not have internet.

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nikeza lowo ahamba naye ikhophi:** While helpful, this doesn't address the individual's need to have a copy readily accessible on their personal device.
*   **B: Yithumele kuye nge-email:** This requires internet access to send and receive, which the person doesn't have.
*   **D: Ukugcina ikhophi “kuyi-cloud”:** The ""cloud"" is an online storage service. This requires internet access, which the person doesn't have.

Storing a copy on their laptop or tablet ensures access to the document regardless of internet connectivity."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungadingeki ukuba kuboniswe kuyinqubomgomo?","The correct answer is **D: Ikheli le-email lomnikazi wenqubomgomo**.

The passage specifically mentions needing the insurance provider's email address and international phone numbers for advice/authorization. It does not mention the policyholder's email address needing to be on the policy itself.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yimuphi usayizi ongemuhle oveza uhlelo lwefilimu oluvame ukusetshenziswa kakhulu?","The correct answer is **D: U-36 X 24 mm kokungekuhle**.

The passage states that once you are comfortable with adding and removing things on the web, you can *later* create your own website. This implies that creating your own website is a subsequent step after honing your skills on an established travel blog.
"
"Lapho uqala ibhizinisi lokubhala ngohambo, yiliphi ikhono kulawa alandelayo okungase kudingeke uwacijise kuqala?","The correct answer is **A: Ukukwazi ukubhala i-blog**.

The passage explicitly states that the easiest way to start a travel writing business is to develop your skills through an established travel blog. This means honing your blogging skills is the initial priority. While website skills are mentioned, they are presented as something to focus on *later*, after you're comfortable with the basics.

"Ngokwale ndaba, ukuchayeka njalo kungaholela ekuchayekeni kuphi?","The correct answer is **B: Emagciwaneni endawo**.

The passage states, ""... ngenxa yalokhu kuvezwa njalo kwamagciwane endawo, amathuba asephezulu kakhulu okuthi kungenzeka nawe usugomekile kuwo."" This directly implies that constant exposure leads to immunization against local germs.
"

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that with a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for individual visas for each Schengen member country. This directly corresponds to **A**.
*   The passage also states that it saves money, which corresponds to **B**.
*   The passage indicates that generally you can cross borders without passport checks, which corresponds to **C**.
*   While the passage mentions that border checks are less frequent, it doesn't say that passports are *not* required at all. Therefore **D** is not correct."
Yini engasatholakala ethuneni likaTutankhamun?,"The passage states: ""...kubonakala ikhanda namahlombe kuphela."" Therefore the correct answer is:

*   **B: Ikhanda lesidumbu**
*   **C: Amahlombe esidumbu**"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iyiphi indawo yaseVancouver engabakhanga kancane abantu abavakashile abakhathazeke kakhulu ngamanani? ","The answer is **D: Whistler**.

The passage states that ""Whistler (a 1.5-hour drive from Vancouver) is expensive."" This directly implies that it might be less appealing to visitors concerned about prices. The other options are not explicitly mentioned as being expensive.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iyiphi indawo ebonakala inganikeza izivakashi isikhathi esimnandi eVancouver?","The correct answer is **A: Bowen Island** and **B: Whistler**.

The passage explicitly mentions Bowen Island as a popular day trip or weekend getaway, offering activities like kayaking, hiking, shops, and restaurants. It also mentions Whistler as a popular (though more expensive) destination for both winter (skiing) and summer (mountain biking) activities.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, kufanele abavakashi bayivakashele nini i-Fall uma befuna ukubuka ngaphandle kwezithiyo?","The correct answer is **D: Ngaphandle kwenkathi ezimvula**.

The passage states that during the rainy season (November to March), the water levels are high and the mist is so intense that it can obscure the view of the falls. Therefore, to see the falls without obstruction, you should visit outside of the rainy season.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini ejabulisayo ngokuvakashela iVictorial Falls phakathi noNovemba noMashi?","The correct answer is **C: Isimangaliso sokubuka lo mfula** (The wonder of viewing the river).

The passage states that during the rainy season (November to March), the water level is high, and the Falls are at their most powerful. While visibility might be obscured sometimes, the *power* and *intensity* of the Falls are the draw. This makes viewing the river during this period a wonder, even if visibility is reduced at times.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungatuswa lapho usebenzisa i-drone ukushe wenze ifilimu?","The correct answer is **A: Ukubheka kusengaphambili ukuthi unayo yini imvume yokushutha**.

The passage states: ""Uma wenza umsindo obeleselayo, hlola kusengaphambili ukuthi ikuphi ovunyelwe ukukuthwebula nokuthi yiziphi izimvume noma amalayisensi engeziwe edingekayo.""  This directly supports the recommendation to check beforehand if you have permission to film. While the passage also mentions additional licenses (B), checking for permission is the more direct and primary action.  C is implied but not explicitly stated. D is directly contradicted by the statement about not flying drones near crowds.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, zikuphi izindaba ezinhle kakhulu zokusebenzisa i-drone?","Based on the passage, the best course of action regarding drone usage is **D: Ezindaweni lapho uthole khona imvume kusengaphambili (In areas where you have obtained permission in advance)**.

The passage emphasizes checking permissions and licenses before filming anything, suggesting that obtaining permission is crucial. The other options all involve situations that the passage implies are potentially problematic or unethical.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isitatimende mayelana nezimfuneko zokubhalisela ivisa esingelona iqiniso?","Impendulo efanele ngu- **B: Wonke amazwe adinga ukubhalisa kuyiziphathimandla zendawo**.

Indaba ithi ukubhalisa kuyimfuneko kwamanye amazwe, hhayi wonke. Lesi esinye isitatimende ziyiqiniso ngokusekelwe endabeni.
"
"Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo, okungeyona indawo labo abavakashile abangaya khona ukuze bayobhalisa?","The answer is **C: Ehhovisini leposi lendawo**.

The passage mentions registration at:

*   Local police station
*   Hotel
*   Office for foreigners
It does not mention the local post office."
Yini engase ingabi inzuzo ekuvolontiyeni kuyilapho usohambeni?,"The passage states that volunteering while traveling allows you to ""stay longer in a place as many volunteer jobs provide accommodation and food and a few pay a stipend.""

Therefore, the advantage of volunteering mentioned from the options is:
*   D: Umuntu ongase abe nesifiso sendlu nendawo yokuhlala (Someone who may desire lodging and accommodation)

The passage also mentions the benefits of learning new skills, so:
*   C: Umuntu onethemba lokuthola ikhono elisha (Someone hoping to gain a new skill) is also a reason one might volunteer while travelling.

The passage mentions meeting new people, so:
*   A: Umuntu ozama ukwakha abangane abasha (Someone trying to make new friends) is also a reason one might volunteer while travelling.

The passage does not promote the expectation of ""umholo omncane"" (small salary) and instead states that only a few jobs pay a stipend. So the answer is:

*   B: Umuntu ozama ukuthola umholo omncane (Someone trying to earn a small salary)"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ukuvolontiya lapho uhambile kungamzuzisa kanjani umuntu ovakashile ngokwezimali?","The correct answer is **C: Indlu nendawo yokuhlala kuvame ukunikezwa**.

The passage states ""...imisebenzi eminingi yokuvolontiya ihlinzeka indawo yokuhlala nokudla futhi embalwa iholela iholo."" This directly addresses the financial benefit of volunteering, which is the provision of accommodation and sometimes food, saving the volunteer money.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engase ibhekwe njengohambo nje lokuya eWalt Disney World?","The correct answer is **C: Ukuchitha isikhathi sonke uhlala endaweni yaseDisney**.

The passage states that a ""typical"" trip involves staying within the Disney property for the duration of the visit.
"
Yisiphi isitatimende mayelana neWalt Disney World esingelona iqiniso?,"Based on the passage, the statement that is NOT true about Walt Disney World is:

**A: Amathikithi ePark-hopper ayakwazi ukuthunyelwa nakwabanye abantu**

The passage explicitly states that Disney prohibits the transfer of tickets. Therefore, park-hopper tickets (which allow access to multiple parks) would also be non-transferable. The other options are mentioned as being true in the passage.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iziphi izinkinga ezilandelayo engaze kungaxoxwa ngayo ekuqeqeshweni okusezingeni eliphezulu noma ezincwadini?","The correct answer is **A: Ukukwazi ukusinda endle**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions that survival skills are often discussed in books and magazines, but that books on war zones are less common. It then goes on to say that the training covers topics in depth, usually in a practical way.
*   Option B is incorrect because the passage says the course will include ""plenty of emergency service""
*   Option C is incorrect because the entire premise of the passage is training for war zones.
*   Option D is incorrect because the passage says the course will include simulation games.

Therefore, since wilderness survival is already covered elsewhere, it's less likely to be a focus of specialized war zone training or materials."
"Ngokwale ndaba, isiphi isifundo esilandelayo okungenzela kwaxoxwa ngayo ekuqeqeshweni okusezingeni eliphezulu?","The correct answer is **A: Usizo lokuqala**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly mentions ""insiza yezimo eziphuthumayo eningi,"" which is synonymous with first aid.
*   The other options are addressed throughout the paragraph, so, ""Usizo lokuqala"" kuyisifundo okungenzeka ukuthi sixoxiwe ngaso ukuze umqondo uphelele."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi ongakukhetha okungcono ekugwemeni ukugcola kwamanzi?","The best answer based on the passage is **B: Thenga amanzi asebhodleleni**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly suggests buying bottled water from a reputable company if you have concerns about contamination. This is presented as a reliable way to avoid potential problems.
*   While boiling water (A and C) is mentioned, the passage points out that its effectiveness varies depending on the situation. This makes it less of a guaranteed solution than bottled water.
*   Option D is not mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, option B is the most supported answer from the text provided."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engase ingabi nakwenzeka ngisho nakubabhukudi abanekhono?","The correct answer is **C: Ukubhukuda uphambane namagagasi**.

The passage states that ""Ukufa okuningi kwenzeka ngenxa yokukhathala kokuzama ukubhukuda uya emuva ngokuphambene nomsinga, okungaba yinto engenakwenzeka."" This directly indicates that swimming against the current (uphambane namagagasi) is the near-impossible task.
"
Yini okufanele uyenze lapho ubanjwa amagagasi?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **A: Zama ukuphuma kuwo ngokubheka kolunye uhlangothi, yibe usubhukuda uye ogwini.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""ukufa okuningi kwenzeka ngenxa yokukhathala kokuzama ukubhukuda uya emuva ngokuphambene nomsinga, okungaba yinto engenakwenzeka. Ngokushesha ngemva kokuba uphuma emsingeni wamanzi, ukubhukudela emuva akusabi nzima ngokuvamile."" which means that swimming against the current is not advisable.
*   The question requires you to try to get out of the stream, then swim to shore."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi lapho ukungavakashela khona inqaba kungaba isikhathi esiyinqophamlando eholidini lakho?","The passage mentions visiting castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, and taking a cruise on the Danube and the Erie Canal. The question asks where **not** visiting a castle would be a memorable holiday experience.

*   **A: Edolobheni eliseduze neDanube** - The passage mentions a cruise on the Danube, not castles necessarily.
*   **B: Eduze ne-Erie Canal** - The passage mentions a boat trip down the Erie Canal, not castles necessarily.
*   **C: ERhine Valley** - The passage specifically mentions visiting castles in the Rhine Valley.
*   **D: Eduze nendawo ezinamanzi** - This is too generic.

Therefore, the best answer is **B: Eduze ne-Erie Canal**. While the Danube could also be argued as a possible answer, Erie Canal is the only answer that the passage does not connect to castles in any way.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungatuswa ngabesifazane abavakashele lezi zindawo?","The correct answer is **A: Kugweme ukukhuluma ngokuthi ushadile yini noma cha**.

The passage *recommends* that female travelers *say* they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.  Therefore, avoiding talking about whether they are married or not is the opposite of the advice given. The other options reflect advice given in the passage.
"
"Ngokwalokho indawo echazwe ngayo endabeni, yikuphi okungasiza abesifazane abavakashile?","Based on the passage, the most helpful piece of advice for women visiting this location is:

*   **A: Bephawule ukuthi akujwayelekile ukuba balandelwe**
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, isiphi isibonelo esingadinga umuntu oshutha izilwane angakusebenzisa ngezinto ze-lens?","The correct answer is **A: Ikakhulu uma beshutha isilwane esincane**

The passage states: ""...although things like a flock of birds or **small creatures require other lenses**."" This directly implies that a photographer might need a different lens specifically for photographing small animals.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungazange kubalwe endabeni engase ibe inkinga kulabo abashutha izilwane?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukuthola uhlobo kwe-lens edingekayo**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Ukuthola izilwane ezithile:** The passage states, ""Izilwane eziningi ezingavamile kunzima ukuzithola..."" (Many rare animals are hard to find...)
*   **B: Ukusebenza nezilwane ezinolaka:** The passage says, ""Izilwane zasendle zingaba namahloni noma zibe nolaka."" (Wildlife can be shy or aggressive.)
*   **D: Ukusebenza ezimweni ezingezinhle kakhulu:** The passage says, ""Indawo ingabanda, ishise, noma ibe yimbi ngenye indlela."" (The environment can be cold, hot, or otherwise unpleasant.)

While the passage mentions needing different lenses, it does not specifically state finding the correct lens *type* as a potential *problem*. It simply says that a long lens is often needed and that other lenses are sometimes needed for things like flocks of birds or small creatures. The problem is more about having the *right lens*, not identifying what *type* of lens is right."
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungase kubangele izinkinga ngomshayeli odlula izintaba?,"The correct answer is **D: Kungabonakali kahle phambili**.

The passage explicitly mentions that visibility can be restricted by falling or blowing snow, or by moisture or ice on the car windows. This directly relates to poor visibility. The other options are not explicitly mentioned in the passage.
"
Yini engase iqhubeke ikhona mayelana nentela emazweni amaningi?,"The passage states:

*   ""Intela yomholo ihlelwe ngendlela ehlukile emazweni ahlukene, futhi namanani nezingxenye ezehlukile zentelaziyehlukahlukakusuka kwelinye izwe kuya kwelinye.""

This implies that **amanani** (A) and **izakhiwo** (B) can vary greatly between countries. However, the question asks what may also vary.

While the passage focuses on income tax, option D ""Ezinye izinhlobo zentela"" aligns with the fact that tax systems differ by countries, including the types of taxes levied (e.g., VAT, sales tax, property tax).
The best answer is D.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, uma usebenza phesheya kodwa ukwenye indawo ikuphi lapho kubonakala sengathi ungathumela khona izinto zakho zentela?","The correct answer is **C: Ezweni osebenza kulo**.

The passage states: ""ukusebenza phesheya ngokuvamile kusho ukuthi kuzodingeka ukhokhe intela ezweni okulona."" This directly implies that you need to pay taxes in the country where you are working.
"
Yiziphi izitatimende kwezilandelayo esingayichazi kahle Imibukiso Yomhlaba?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukubonisa isayensi yezitshalo eduzane nezobuciko nezemfundo**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Imibukiso yalokho amazwe anakho ezintweni zamagugu noma amasiko** - This is a correct description of World's Fairs. The text states countries display art, education, culture, and history.
*   **B: Ukubonisa isayensi yezitshalo eduzane nezobuciko nezemfundo** - While Horticultural Expositions focus on plants, World's Fairs are broader in scope. Horticultural expositions zikhangisa ngezimbali, izingadi zezimbali kanye nanoma yini ehlangene nezitshalo
*   **C: Le micimbi ingathatha izinyanga eziyisithupha** - The text confirms that these events typically last between three and six months.
*   **D: Amazwe awaphoqelekile ukuba abambe iqhaza** - This is implied to be true. The text describes countries choosing to participate to showcase their culture or address global issues.

Therefore, option B is the statement that does not accurately describe World's Fairs."
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okuwuthetho weWorld Fair noma i-International Exposition?,"The correct answer is **B: Izwe elifanayo alikwazi ukubamba le mibukiso minyaka yonke.**

Here's why:

*   The passage says that the Horticultural Expositions (a type of World's Fair) ""although in theory they could happen every year (as long as they are in different countries), in practice this is not the case."" This implies the same country cannot host them every year.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Imibukiso kufanele ibonise kokubili umlando wezwe nezinkinga zomhlaba** The passage states that participating nations display art and education in national pavilions to illustrate global issues or their country's culture and history, implying it isn't mandatory to display both.

*   **C: Imibukiso kufanele ithathe izinyanga eziyisithupha** The passage says the events typically last between ""three and six months,"" meaning six months is the maximum, not a requirement.

*   **D: Ukuze lo mbukiso ube khona wonke amazwe kufanele abambe iqhaza** The passage does not require all the nations of the world to take part, it says that ""nations that take part..."""
Ukwenza kuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okunganciphisa ukuhlasela kwezilwane?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukususa udoti ezindaweni olahlwa kuzo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""...phawula ukuthi iphunga libiza amabhere kanye nezinye izilwane zasendle, ngakho gwema ukuphatha noma ukupheka ukudla okunephunga futhi ugcine ikamu lihlanzekile."" This directly connects cleanliness with reducing animal attraction and potential attacks. Getting rid of garbage eliminates the smell which attracts wild animals.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuphatha amakhambi anephunga elimnandi:** This is the opposite of what the passage suggests. Strong smells attract animals.
*   **C: Ukugcina ibanga elingamayadi angu-25 nezimpisi:** The passage clearly says to maintain 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves.
*   **D: Ukuvimba izilwane lapho zifuna ukudla okulahliwe:** This would be ineffective. Preventing access to food is not the real problem; rather, keeping food in the first place is the real problem.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungashiwongo kule ndaba njengento eyimbangela yokuhlasela kwezilwane zasendle?,"The correct answer is **D: Izilwane ezingabajwayele abantu**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Iphunga elinamandla:** The passage mentions that strong smells attract bears and other wildlife, which could lead to an attack.
*   **B: Ukwehluleka ukugcina ibanga:** The passage explicitly states that many visitors are injured each year because they don't keep a safe distance from the animals.
*   **C: Ukondla izilwane zasendle:** The passage advises not to feed the wild animals. Feeding wildlife can make animals more aggressive and approach humans more frequently, increasing the risk of an attack.
*   **D: Izilwane ezingabajwayele abantu:** The passage states ""Nakuba izilwane eziningi epaki zijwayele ukubona abantu..."" This implies that the animals *are* used to seeing people, not that they *aren't*. Therefore, this isn't mentioned as a *cause* of attacks."
