This not only proves a widely circulated theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that most fossils cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional composition.
Scientists say that the outer layer of the feathers of this animal is chestnut brown, and the inner layer is a pale white or carrot color.
The discovery also provides a deep insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because the feathers of dinosaurs lacked a well-developed central shaft, or feather shaft, they did possess other feather characteristics, namely the feather rachis and barbs, so researchers infer that these other characteristics likely evolved into the feather rachis later on.
The structure of these feathers indicates that they are not used for flying but for regulating temperature or display. Researchers said that even though this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows that they are mature feathers, not downy fluff of chicks.
Researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the feathers in the sample are fully developed, not the down of a young animal.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: the voter is alone in the voting booth, putting the pre-printed ballot indicating their choice into an envelope.
After the official has confirmed the voter's identity, the voter will then place the envelope into the ballot box and sign the ballot paper.

The candidate can appoint representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers follow specific procedures for counting votes under strict supervision.

Schneider offered a video testimony at a U.S. Air Force base in his hometown.
Apart from the game on Wednesday, Carpanedo also participated in two individual events in the championship.
Her first game was the small turns race, and the first round ended with an unfinished match. Among the 116 players in the game, 36 obtained the same score.
Her other race was the giant slalom, where she ranked 10th in the women's sit-skiing category with a combined time of 4 minutes 41 seconds 30, 2 minutes 11 seconds 60 slower than Claudia Loesch from Austria, who ranked 1st, and 1 minute 09 seconds 02 slower than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who ranked 9th.
In the women's seated group, four skiers were unable to complete the race, and among the 117 skiers in the big turn race, 45 did not receive a ranking in the race.
The central state police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Commissioner D K Arya said, "We have arrested five suspects of raping the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendant's name is Baba Kangjiaer, Bussa Kangjiaer, Lanpuoluo Kangjiaer, Jiazha Kangjiaer, and Weisnu Kangjiaer.
Police officer Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendant appeared in court with a mask.
Although the vehicle collided with the house while three people were inside, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The section of the road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency rescuers extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
At first, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was later charged with the murder of her son at the Edinburgh County Court.
She is currently in detention, awaiting prosecution and trial, but because her image has been widely distributed, any testimonies from witnesses could be contaminated.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the operation of the Scottish judiciary is different, with the courts believing that releasing photos could create potential prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dan University pointed out, "If journalists release photos and other information about suspects, they do indeed appear to be walking on a tightrope."
The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, responsible for overall prosecutorial matters, has informed journalists that they will refrain from making any further comments at least until the indictment.
According to the leaked document, it will mention the boundary dispute between Palestine and Israel, with Palestine hoping to base it on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East war.
It is said that other topics in the document include the future direction of the shared holy city of Jerusalem and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel has requested to continue to station troops in the Jordan Valley for ten years if an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority has agreed to only allow troops to remain for five years.
Hunters participating in the harmful animal control reinforcement experiment will be closely monitored by the National Park management, as relevant authorities need to monitor and evaluate the performance of this experiment.
The NPWS collaborated with the NSW Shooting Sports Association to recruit qualified volunteers for the shooting sports association's hunting program.
According to the Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage of New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service, Mick O'Flaherty, the 4 shooters selected for the first shoot have received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Madeli swore yesterday in the ad hoc election commission (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is the fifth ad hoc election committee within four years of Madeli.
As part of a comprehensive set of measures to advance the country towards new elections, the Presidential Commission recommended the former interim election commission to resign last month.
The committee was established in response to the widespread anti-government protests that started in October.
These protests, which sometimes turn violent, are sparked by the inability to hold elections, some of which should have been held as early as 2011.
It is reported that there are about 60 cases of iPod overheating, resulting in a total of 6 fires and causing minor burns to 4 people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) in Japan has confirmed that there have been 27 incidents related to the device.
Last week, the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents to them, with the company claiming that these incidents are "not serious".
The government department responded, stating that Apple's delay in reporting is "regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (Friday 09:19 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time).
The Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands stated that no reports of damages have been received domestically.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there are no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus of Hong Kong tourists in the capital of the Philippines, Manila, and held them hostage.
Rolando Mondosa fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued so far, and at least six deaths have been confirmed.
They first released six hostages, including children and the elderly, just like the Filipino photographer.
Two photographers later exchanged with an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Finally Mendoza was shot dead.
Lijin followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical field.
He received training to become an obstetrician and began practicing at the Oakland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Sir Liggins will take advantage of his time after work at the hospital to study the phenomenon of premature births.
His research shows that administering a certain hormone will accelerate the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
The government investigation team found two "black boxes" flight recorders on Wednesday, reported by Xinhua News Agency.
Wrestlers also pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Zelman once said, "Luna was the first extreme queen. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the double moon, very special, just like her. A strong woman."
Famous wrestler "Goldust" Dustin Runnels commented: "Luna was as strange as I am... maybe even stranger than me... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she's gone to a better place."
In 2010, 8% more people opposed Australia becoming a republic than in 2008, among the 1400 people who voted before the federal election.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
In the survey, 34% of people agree with the view that they hope Queen Elizabeth II becomes the last monarch of Australia.
In two extreme results of the poll, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
This Olympic gold medalist was originally scheduled to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle events as well as the three swimming relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his symptoms have raised doubts about his physical condition.
He is unable to use medication to suppress the pain because the Olympics prohibit the use of those drugs.
Mathematician and computer science professor Curtis Cooper at the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
By early February, several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software, and it was officially announced on Tuesday.
The water on Earth may have been brought by comets, and the organic compounds in the water can form proteins to supply the needs of life.
Scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, especially Earth, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
The 53-year-old Gu Mo took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to these rumors as "political rumors and foolishness".
He is speculated to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system claimed by the US Federal Aviation Administration to shorten aircraft flight paths, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and significantly reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the old ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There are no other transportation options available, and the overground train will not stop at Wembley, with no available parking lots or parking transfer plans on site.
Due to concerns about inconvenient transportation, the game may be forced to start without the support of fans from each team who are unable to attend.
A research published on Thursday in the journal "Science" reported that new bird species are emerging in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Although people used to believe that the evolution of new species takes a longer time, researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Switzerland have found that this new species evolved in just two generations. It is a hybrid of the local species Geospiza fortis and the introduced cactus finch Geospiza scandens.
Gold can be crafted into various shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
Gold can be stretched into fine wires, and then wrapped and woven. It can also be hammered or rolled into thin sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhered to other metals. Because it can be made very thin, it is sometimes used in a type of book called "clay gold decorated manuscript" to decorate hand-painted pictures.
This is called the acidity of chemistry. You can use purple cabbage juice as an indicator.
Cabbage juice will change color based on the acidity of the chemical substances.
The pH is determined by the hydrogen ion content in the chemical substance (the H in pH refers to hydrogen).
Hydrogen ion is a proton after losing an electron (because a hydrogen atom is composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two types of powder together, then use clean, wet hands to squeeze and press it into a ball shape.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, thus creating a strange texture and forming a kind of shell.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro has a flush toilet, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
In the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remnants of a sewage system were discovered under the houses.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China there were also toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were part of public bathhouses where men and women bathed together.
When calling a friend far away, it's done through artificial satellites.
The man-made satellite in space receives the signal and instantly reflects it back to Earth.
The artificial satellite is launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere can sometimes distort our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in remarkable ways. Its greatest contribution to humanity is providing us with a simpler and faster means of transportation.
It has brought us trains, cars, and other transportation devices.
The species below them are a variety of medium-sized felines that primarily prey on medium-sized animals such as rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Many small cats (occasionally domestic cats) will also prey on a variety of small animals, including insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to success lies in the concept of niche, which means that each cat's job is unique, so they won't compete with each other.
Lions are the most sociable species in the cat family, living in large groups called prides.
Within the lion pride, there are one to three adult male lions, along with up to thirty female lions and cubs.
Female lions are usually close relatives to each other, being sisters and daughters within the same extended family.
The behavior of a pride of lions is very similar to that of a pack of wolves or dogs, these two animals surprisingly resemble lions (but not other large cats), and are also very fierce towards their prey.
Tigers are all-around athletes, capable of climbing (although not very specialized), swimming, long-distance jumping, and possessing over five times the pulling force of a strong human.
Tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars belong to the same genus (Panthera). Only these four species of big cats have the ability to roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the roar of a lion, it is more like a mix of chaotic, shouting words.
The jaguarundi likes to eat small animals, and they will hunt monkeys, snakes, and rodents, and if possible, they will also hunt birds. The prey of the jaguarundi is almost always much smaller than their own size.
Scientists believe that the American leopard relies on its sense of smell to track and find prey, using its sense of smell to locate the whereabouts of prey.
They have good night vision and can move silently in the night. The way tigers hunt is by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from their main population (such as by crossing mountains or rivers, or migrating to a new island where they cannot easily return to), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so new talents need different traits or changes in order to have stronger competitiveness than before.
The original population has not changed at all, so the same adaptive function as before is still needed.
As time passed, the newborn population began to adapt to the new environment, and their appearance became increasingly different from others.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will appear to be so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, indicating the emergence of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence of the evolutionary process and is also a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen for humans to breathe in and absorb the carbon dioxide humans exhale.
Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis. Plants also provide shade at the same time.
We use plants to build houses, make clothes, and most of the food we eat is also plants; without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The Canglong is the top predator of that period, so they are not afraid of any other creature besides other Canglongs.
Its long lower jaw is filled with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus another set of teeth in the upper jaw, which means that no living creature in front of it can escape.
Although we cannot be certain, we believe it may have a bifurcated tongue. It may eat turtles, large fish, other Carcharodontosaurus dinosaurs, and even possibly its own kind.
It will also attack anything that enters the water; even large dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus rex are no match for it.
Although most of the food of the Romans is not unfamiliar to us, they do indeed consume some strange or rare foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women sit on chairs to eat their food, wealthy men prefer to join banquets and recline to enjoy their feasts.
The dining in ancient Rome did not include the foods that were later brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and the ancient Romans never ate turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each god, which was considered the home of the god.
People will prepare offerings to present to the gods, and the priests will try to satisfy the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Every temple has a spacious temple courtyard, followed by an inner sanctuary that only priests can enter.
Some temples also have special tower-shaped pagodas, called tower temples.
The top of the tower is the special sanctuary of the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house isn't so important.
Most of the time in Jewish family life is spent outdoors.
The women will cook in the yard; the store is just a counter facing the street. People at that time would build houses with stones.
The land of Canaan does not have large forests, so wood is especially expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In Scandinavian epic sagas, the red-haired Eric was exiled from Iceland for murder, and as he ventured further west, he discovered Greenland and named it as such.
But regardless of his findings, the Eskimo tribe was already living there at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think that there is a treasure map on the back of the "Declaration of Independence".
However, that is not the case. While there are some handwritten notes on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The text on the back of the "Declaration of Independence" in the United States reads "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text is written in an upside-down manner at the bottom.
Although no one knows who wrote this passage, it is certain that this enormous parchment document (approximately 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was originally rolled up for storage.
Therefore, including this segment is likely just for marking purposes.
The Normandy landing and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remains unliberated.
The region was governed by the Vichy French. These French people lived peacefully with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the aggressors instead of resisting.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces attacked the south of France in a movement known as "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the US Army and the Free French Forces liberated Southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a group of people living and working together in significant numbers and in a collaborative manner (i.e. society).
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis", meaning "of or relating to citizens". It is related to the Latin "civis" and "civitas", meaning "citizen" and "city or state" respectively, which in a way also defines the scale of society.
City-state is the predecessor of a country, and civilization and culture refer to the inheritance of knowledge from several generations, the continuous cultural traces, and the widespread dissemination.
Smaller-scale cultures often disappear without leaving historical traces and cannot be recognized as a legitimate civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, these thirteen states first established a fragile central government according to the Articles of Confederation (with Congress being its only institution).
The parliament does not have the power to levy taxes, and because there is no national executive or judicial departments, it must rely on the often uncooperative state power institutions to enforce the law.
It also does not have the power to repeal the tax laws and tariffs between states.
These regulations require unanimous consent from all states to be amended, but the states are very careless in their attitude towards the central government, and their representatives are often absent.
The Italy national football team and the Germany national football team are both the second most successful teams in the world, and they were also the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, inline hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern region, where the locals will also participate in international and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (with the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
"Due to Japan having a group / cluster of islands, from a geographical perspective, Japan is often classified as an "archipelago."
Taiwan's history can be traced back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the name of this island as Formosa, which means beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the indigenous people's grain production methods and hiring Chinese laborers to work in the company's rice and sugarcane fields.
In 1683, the Qing government took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan by force, and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Dynasty in 1885.
In 1895, after the Qing government's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), they signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan. Japan began to rule Taiwan from then on, until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the ruins have been reconstructed to help visitors better understand the original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration work has continued to this day.
For example, the most common static image photography format in the world is 35mm, which is also the primary film size at the end of the analog film era.
It continues to be produced to this day, but more importantly, the aspect ratio of the digital camera's sensor has remained the same.
In fact, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, with a width of 36 mm and a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by 12 to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS advanced photography system format) are equivalent to or close to this aspect ratio.
The often misused and ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guiding principle that helps to create dynamism while keeping the composition balanced.
After dividing the image into three equal parts vertically and horizontally, the intersections of the lines are the most effective positions for capturing the subject (see example).
During this period in European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under strict scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, despite the existence of differences in language and customs, Christianity has continued to closely connect the various countries in Europe.
Its omnipresent power affects everyone, from kings to commoners.
Christianity has a main creed, which is that wealth must be used to help those who are suffering and poor, and the funds of the church are specifically set up for this purpose.
For over a thousand years, the core of the church's power has been located in Rome, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether the church truly follows this creed.
Soon after the outbreak of the war, Britain began a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategic, which cuts off necessary military and civilian supplies, has indeed been effective, although this blockade method has violated international laws that have been established through various international agreements and widely accepted by countries over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire area, even endangering neutral ships.
Germany therefore believes that their unrestricted submarine warfare will not provoke strong reactions due to other countries' lack of response to this tactic.
In the 1920s, the general attitude of most citizens and the country was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the fear and atrocities of the First World War, all countries hoped to avoid such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and took a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a recommendation letter written by Charles Batchelor, his former manager, for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China used unique ways to signify different periods; each stage or ruling dynasty belonged to radically different dynasties.
During the change of dynasties, it was also a period of division and turmoil in various regions. The most famous of these is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles engaged in fierce wars to compete for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the most bloody times in ancient Chinese history, where countless people lost their lives in the struggle to claim the throne in the magnificent Imperial Palace in Xi'an.
The revolution has produced many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from despotism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than the exclusive ruler.
After the revolution, all kinds of job openings are open to all proactive male job seekers, allowing the most willing and accomplished to take charge.
The same situation also occurs in the military, as they no longer use ranks to distinguish military ranks, but instead base it on capabilities.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working classes of many other countries to start revolutions.
Muhammad is deeply interested in transcending the mundane world and often goes to the cave called "Hira" on Mount Nur to meditate.
The cave itself has undergone the changes of the times and presents a vivid Muhammadan spiritual aspect.
This cave is located on a mountain peak north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
Actually, even if someone knows its existence, it's not easy to find. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated from the world.
Apart from the clear and beautiful sky above and the surrounding mountains, nothing else can be seen; the inside of the cave only reveals or allows the perception of a small part of the world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that is still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC and is one of many large pyramid structures built to commemorate deceased pharaohs.
Located in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, the Giza plateau, or "Giza Pyramid Complex", includes several pyramids (the largest of which is the largest in the world), several smaller tombs, several temples, and a huge sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the ancient Pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives, mistresses, and family members.
"Upper bow" marks look like a V, and "lower bow" marks look like staples, also resembling a square with an open bottom.
Up means you should start pushing the bow from the tip of the bow, and down means you should start pulling the bow from the bow handle (where you hold the bow).
The up-bow mark usually represents a softer sound, while the down-bow mark represents a stronger and more firm sound.
Please feel free to make marks with a pencil, but please remember that the bowing marks printed on the page all have musical significance, so they should not be ignored.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), as well as the king's sister Princess Elisabeth, were forced by a group of market women to move back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris by carriage and were surrounded by a group of rioters along the way, who yelled and threatened the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of the carriage.
At one point, a member of the mob even brandished the head of a royal guard in front of the terrified queen, who was later killed at the Palace of Versailles.
The war expenses for the American imperialist campaign in the Philippines are paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They are forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government, covering the majority of government expenses, while the bonds interest is floated through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippines government.
Of course, for a long time, the excessive profits obtained by exploiting the people of the Philippines have become the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to the establishment of this organization.
The period in which these events usually occurred is referred to as the High Middle Ages, which is the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries of European history (1000–1300 AD).
The Middle Ages was traditionally considered to end around 1500, after the mid and before the late Middle Ages.
The term "technological determinism" encompasses many practical concepts, from technology-driven or technology-dominant changes, to the more rigorous "the relevant logic of scientific laws and the expression forms of science in technology will drive the fate of humanity".
Most interpretations of the determinism of technology are based on two main ideas: the development of technology itself has a much greater impact than cultural or political factors, and technology in turn will "influence" the inherent form of society, rather than being constrained by society.
For example, some people argue that automobiles will inevitably drive road development.
However, building a national highway network for the sake of a small number of cars is not cost-effective, prompting people to develop new manufacturing methods to reduce the ownership cost of cars.
The increasing number of people owning cars will also increase the likelihood of road accidents, leading to the development of new medical techniques for repairing injured limbs in humans.
The theory of cultural determinism is one of the important components of romanticism, often drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, the geographical environment shapes individuals and, over time, gives rise to customs and cultures related to that geographical environment. These customs and cultures are better than laws that are arbitrarily implemented because they are in harmony with the local society.
Constantinople is also hailed as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, just as Paris is hailed as the fashion capital of the contemporary world.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around the year 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders had returned with silk and spices as gifts, which were more valuable than what was sold in the Byzantine market.
At this moment, the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was greatly influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles may be 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own unique style. One major development at the time was the use of buttons by members of the Crusades to fasten their clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a type of agriculture where crop yields are only sufficient to feed the farmers and their families.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple agricultural system that typically practices organic farming, preserves and uses local ecological zone native crop seeds, and utilizes crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
In history, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and many developing countries are still doing so.
Subculture allows people with similar interests and who feel ignored by mainstream society to come together, thus creating a sense of identity.
Subcultures will have distinct characteristics due to the age range, ethnicity, social class, geographical location, or gender of their members.
The qualities that enable subcultures to be established may be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or various factors.
Members of subcultures usually express their belonging to the group through special, symbolically meaningful forms, including dress, behavior, and the use of slang.
A common method used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite several unfortunate cases of children who have been neglected, unfortunate, or deliberately abused during their growth process, thereby not receiving the socialization process given to adults.
These children are called "wild children". Some wild children have been subjected to confinement (often by their parents); in some cases, children are abandoned because their parents do not accept their intellectual or physical disabilities.
Homeless children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Other children are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
If feral children are raised entirely by non-human animals, they will exhibit behaviors almost identical to those of the animals caring for them, such as showing fear or indifference towards humans.
The project-based learning method makes learning easier and more interesting, while scaffolding learning takes it to the next level.
The scaffolding teaching is not a learning method, but a kind of support, which can provide support for people who are undergoing new learning experiences (such as using a new computer program or starting a new project).
Scaffolding can be both virtual and physical, in other words, both teachers and the staple helper in Microsoft Office are forms of scaffolding.
The virtual scaffolding is built into the software, with the function of asking questions, providing prompts, and explaining procedures that students may have difficulty handling on their own.
Children are sent to foster care centers for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment lacking nurturing, care, and education, but the reality is otherwise.
We believe that the foster care system is the sanctuary for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
Foster families should provide all the necessities that the children lacked in their previous family.
The internet combines the two elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
From the perspective of usage and satisfaction, the distinctive characteristics of the Internet have opened up new horizons.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" can both be considered important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) found in their research on audience reactions to websites that "personal involvement" and "sustained relationships" are also new motivational aspects.
The use of video recording has brought significant discoveries to interpreting microexpressions and fleeting facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, some people believe that it is possible to detect if someone is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks pointed out in his article "The President's Speech" that people who cannot understand the content of a speech due to brain damage can still accurately sense the sincerity of the speaker.
He even believes that domestic animals like dogs may have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the twentieth century shows that there are two types of genetic variations: recessive and dominant.
Mutation will increase new genetic variations, while natural selection will remove them from the pool of dominant variations.
Every generation, separation and recombination will continuously cause changes in both the dominant and recessive sets of genes.
The digestive system is similar to that of humans in primates, making it difficult to obtain enough amino acids from plants on the great plains.
Insufficient intake of amino acids can lead to serious consequences: stunted growth and malnutrition, ultimately leading to death.
The most readily accessible plant resources for protein are leaves and pods, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide high-quality protein containing all essential amino acids.
After considering all factors, if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a way similar to the chimpanzees on the savannah today, we should not be surprised.
The interruption of sleep refers to deliberately waking up during the normal sleep period and then falling asleep again within a short period of time (10-60 minutes later).
By using a relatively quiet alarm clock, you can be conscious without fully waking up, making it easy to do this.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm in your sleep, you can place the alarm on the other side of the room and force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other physiological cycle-based choices include drinking a large amount of liquid before bed (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic), causing people to have to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace in a person is inversely proportional to the level of tension in their body and mind.
The more relaxed the body and mind, the stronger the vitality. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
All people can reach the state of enlightenment. The only obstacle on the path to enlightenment is our own anxiety and negative energy.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been greatly expanded by the path of loving-kindness from Mahayana Buddhism and many techniques from Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple in essence, including Kalachakra Yoga, meditation, and the practice of loving-kindness towards all beings.
During Kundalini yoga practice, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantra chanting, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan Buddhism's meditation is deity yoga. Purify all energy channels, activate chakras, and establish enlightened consciousness through visualizing deities.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which prompted the Soviet Union and the United States to cooperate. With the war ending, conflicts in terms of systems, practices, and cultures have caused rifts between these countries.
The original allies became enemies within only two years after the end of World War II, and the Cold War began.
It lasted for forty years and was carried out by proxy armies in real battles from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
At the time of September 17, 1939, the Polish defense line had been breached, the only hope was to retreat and regroup near the bridgehead in Romania.
However, all of these plans were scrapped overnight. More than 800,000 Soviet Red Army violated the Riga Agreement, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements by invading eastern Poland, and subsequently entering Belarus and Ukraine, forming the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using ships to transport goods is currently the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the sea.
Traditionally, the mission of the navy is to ensure the safe transfer of people and goods, while disrupting the enemy's transfer of personnel and goods.
One of the most notable examples in modern times is the Battle of the North Atlantic during World War II, where the Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to aid the British.
At the same time, the German navy attempted to disrupt shipping (primarily using U-boats).
If the Allies are defeated, Germany may conquer England as they have conquered other parts of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them in order to obtain milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Goats are usually raised in hilly or other grazing areas, typically cared for by children or adolescents, similar to more well-known shepherds. These grazing methods are still in use today.
England built the Malla track as early as the 16th century.
Although the four-wheeled freight track is only composed of parallel wooden planks, it allows horses to drag goods on the track. Compared to the slightly rugged roads at the time, the transport speed is faster and can carry more goods.
People began using sleepers to fix the tracks in place very early on. But gradually, it was discovered that laying down iron bars could increase the efficiency of the track.
This has become a common practice, but the iron will cause more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriage.
Finally, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron railway appeared.
The earliest known form of transportation was walking, and with the appearance of Homo Erectus (also known as upright man), human beings began to walk upright two million years ago.
Their evolutionary predecessors, the southern ancient apes, were not accustomed to walking upright.
Characteristics of bipedal locomotion were found in the fossil of the southern ape dating back to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Chad apes may have been walking bipedally as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living a more environmentally friendly life, participate in the environmental movement, and even become activists in order to minimize future suffering.
In many cases, this is similar to "treating a headache with medicine for the head and treating a footache with medicine for the foot." However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problem and thoroughly solve it.
This world has changed due to the advancement of human science and technology, and the problem has worsened due to overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle of human beings, which is becoming increasingly obvious.
After being passed by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
All night, 150 to 200 copies were printed, now referred to as "Dang Liepu single-sided printing version".
The document was first publicly read by John Nixon on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 remaining single-sided printed copies known to people are the oldest version preserved in this document, and the original manuscript has not been preserved.
Currently, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived to modern times, which is what we call birds.
Because they have feathers and can fly, many people do not consider them to be a type of dinosaur.
Birds still have many similarities with dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
In fact, all computers now operate on messages composed of binary code.
Binary numbers can only have a value of 0 or 1, which are called binary digits, or bits in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not manifest immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are too common to make a direct diagnosis based on them.
The best way to diagnose signs of internal poisoning may be finding opened medicine or toxic household chemical containers.
Review the first aid instructions on the specific poison label.
The term "insect" is the formal designation used by entomologists for this type of insect.
This name comes from the ancient understanding of stink bugs - they are highly adapted insects that parasitize the human body.
The assassin bug and the bed bug both have the characteristic of growing in their nests, and can adapt to living in the residences of their host or in their nests.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the main neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to suffer from multiple sclerosis.
The couple may consider that raising the baby is not in line with their or the child's best interests.
These companions can choose to plan to adopt their children.
Adoption refers to the termination of parental rights by biological parents, allowing another couple to raise their children.
The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through scientific methods. This method actually guides most scientific research.
But the experimental method is not the only one, experiments are tests that can eliminate one or more hypotheses, and asking questions and making observations can also guide scientific research.
The naturalist and philosopher focused on classic texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, are accepted.
With the decline of Greek learning, the Western world severed its ties with the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many scholars have observed that the physiological and behavioral rhythms are largely dependent on the intrinsic biological cycles and the substances produced by the biological clock.
Not only the circadian rhythm that responds to external environmental cues can be observed in most living organisms such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The circadian clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that continues to operate independently even without external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the main experiments demonstrating DNA as the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, also known as viruses, to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, one using radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA of the bacteriophage, and the other using radioactive sulfur to label the protein of the bacteriophage.
Mutations can have various effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are reproductive cells.
Only mutations in germ cells will be passed on to offspring, whereas mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Travel itineraries with a nature theme will attract people interested in nature to join, in order to enjoy the natural scenery, including wildlife and plants.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks to learn about the ecosystem.
For example, visit Borneo, film, and understand orangutans.
Every morning, a group of people drive away from the small town to their workplace, passing another group of people whose starting point is the destination of the first group's work.
In this bustling traffic, everyone is connected to and supports the existence of this car-based transportation system to some extent.
Now, science indicates that such large-scale carbon economic activities have caused the biosphere to deviate from the stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in social activities and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality and bridge collapses.
Why does the transportation system attract so much complaint, and why does it have problems every day? Is it because the transportation engineers are not competent enough, or is there a more fundamental reason?
The traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations, as well as the interaction between road users.
The problem is, it is very difficult to study traffic flow because driving habits cannot be predicted 100%.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to fall within a reasonable range, so traffic also tends to have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, we have defined the relationships between three main features: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships contribute to the planning, design, and operation of transportation facilities.
Insects are the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly allows them to more easily evade predators and more effectively find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings along their bodies.
This allows them to have more small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but many people have the opposite view; they believe that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), move around the earth.
This seems very reasonable, because the Earth does not feel like it is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river by discharge volume on Earth. Its water volume is eight times that of the world's second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on earth, with some stretches reaching up to six miles wide.
20% of the river water flowing into the ocean on Earth comes from the Amazon River.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the ancient kingdom, the scale and outstanding technology of the construction of the Giza pyramids are unparalleled.
During the New Kingdom period, the ancient Egyptians were very amazed by the historical ruins left by their ancestors, which had been preserved for over a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world with the lowest population.
The laws and official documents of the Vatican are all in Italian.
Italian is also widely used by the majority of the workforce in that country, while Latin is mostly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because these elements exist in their natural forms and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle argued that all things are composed of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the 4 states of matter (arranged in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also argues that they would transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered as metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
It can also contain small amounts of non-metallic elements (such as carbon) in the alloy.
All things in the universe are made up of material, and all materials are made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so small that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil became a good friend to many when it first came out.
Unfortunately, with the rise of new writing methods, the status and usage of pencils are gradually declining.
Everyone is now writing messages on the computer screen, and we no longer need to use a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder where the keyboard will go when there is a new invention.
The operating principle of a nuclear fission bomb is based on the fusion of many protons and neutrons into a single atomic nucleus requiring a large amount of energy.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the atomic nucleus again will then release a portion of that energy.
Some atomic cores are unstable, which means they can easily split without or with very little push.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 kilometers thick at the near end and approximately 100 kilometers thick at the far end.
It is thinner under the sea of ​​the month, and thicker under the plateau.
Perhaps there are more lunar seas due to thinner crust in the near term. The magma here is more likely to float to the surface.
The core of content theory is to find something that moves or attracts people.
These theories argue that people develop certain needs or desires which become internalized as they grow into adults.
What makes certain people want certain things, and what makes them want to do or not do certain things in their environment.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory are two popular content theories.
In general, when a supervisor begins to lead their former peers, there may be two possible behaviors. One of them is trying to maintain their status as a member of the peer group.
Managers of this kind find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, impose disciplinary actions, conduct performance evaluations, assign responsibilities, and hold subordinates accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, it will become a completely different person who believes that he or she must change all the practices of the team and act in his or her own way.
After all, leaders are ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to differences between the leader and other team members.
Virtual teams must adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members are usually the contact points for the physical team they work directly with.
They usually have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their team may need to hold meetings in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
A "hidden management team" (excerpt from Larson and LaFasto's 1989 work, page 109) is also a unique element that constitutes a virtual team.
The "Invisible Team" is a management team, where each member belongs directly to the team and is held to standards set by the team.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning institution? One of the goals of putting the organization's learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When each functional department within the organization effectively utilizes all available resources, creativity and originality can be unleashed.
Therefore, the process of overcoming obstacles through joint efforts can drive the innovation process to meet customer needs.
Before the organization has the ability to innovate, leaders should build a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explained the continuous mode, which is a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provides concrete evidence for the theoretical methods of cognitive research, thus narrowing down the scope of research and making it more precise.
The relationship between neuropathology and behavior supports scientists in conducting research.
For a long time, people have always known that different types of brain damage, trauma, pathology, and tumors will affect behavior and cause changes in certain psychological functions.
The invention of new technology allows us to observe and study previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models, which helps to understand the process of how our minds work.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction connotation, it has still become an extremely important branch of computer science, specializing in the handling of machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
One of the contents of artificial intelligence research is to create machines that can automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and the recognition of handwritten text, audio, and faces.
These developments have led to different disciplines, all focused on finding solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, and are also built into some home computers and video game software.
School-sponsored off-campus learning is an important part of school education. Many times, teachers want to take students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology provides virtual off-campus teaching as a solution. Students can sit in the classroom and visit museums, art galleries, aquariums, or appreciate beautiful art.
Sharing the off-campus learning experience through virtual means is also a good way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website for their annual visit to the state capital, and the website is updated every year, but the old versions are still kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs also help to improve students' writing abilities. Although students often start their blogging experience with hasty and sloppy grammar and spelling, they generally can change this because of the presence of readers.
Because students are usually the most critical readers, therefore bloggers/authors will begin to make efforts to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Writing a blog also "forces students to understand the surrounding world more." To satisfy the audience's interests and inspire students to become smarter and more interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing a blog is an inspiring collaborative tool that can encourage students to extend their learning far beyond traditional school life.
The correct use of blogs can enhance students' ability to analyze and criticize; students can define their position in the context of articles written by others by actively responding to online materials, and also outline their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the capital of Canada, with a beautiful and pleasant environment, and uses both English and French languages, with many art galleries and museums showcasing the past and present of Canada.
The southern end is the Niagara Falls, while the north is Mascoka and other areas, the natural beauty here remains undeveloped.
All of the above and many other things make Ontario be seen as a typical Canadian image by foreigners.
In the more northern vast regions, the population is sparse, and some are almost deserted wildernesses.
A surprising population comparison: the number of African American residents in the United States is greater than the citizen population of Canada.
The East African islands are located off the eastern coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is the largest island among them, and its rich wildlife and flora make the island itself a continent.
The majority of smaller islands are independent countries or have a connection with France, and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this land, and Islam has gained great development in Mayotte and Comoros Islands.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India around the Cape of Good Hope.
The north connects to the Sahel region, while the south and west are adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female tourists, regardless of their actual marital status, claim to be married.
Wearing a ring can also be helpful (but don't wear anything that looks too expensive).
Female friends should also understand that cultural differences may lead to situations that they perceive as harassment, such as being followed or having their arms grabbed, which are not uncommon.
When rejecting a man, one should be firm and not be afraid to stand their ground (regardless of cultural differences, this is not acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was established by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. It was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids, and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese razed and rebuilt the city, naming it "Casa Branca" (White House), then abandoned the place after the earthquake in 1755.
Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city and named it "Darul Badia". "Casablanca" was named by Spanish traders who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping places in all of Morocco.
In the old city of Marrakech, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, including tagines, pottery, leather goods, water pipes, and all sorts of fancy accessories, but these are all sold to tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east and near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the lava from Mount Nyiragongo, with most of the city's streets, particularly the city center, being buried.
Although Goma is relatively safe, if you want to travel to areas beyond Goma, you must do your homework and understand the ongoing conflict in the North Kivu province.
This city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, and offers some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking activities in Africa.
You can use a Boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to tour Goma, the short distance usually costs around 500 Congolese Francs (local price).
Because it is relatively difficult to access, "Timbuktu" has gradually become a symbol of a distant and foreign land.
The present-day Tbilisi is a poor town, but its past reputation made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was listed on the endangered World Heritage list due to the threat of desert sandstorms.
This is one of the major stopping points for Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city is significantly different from other cities in the country, as it leans towards having an Arab rather than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,000 square kilometers and is divided into fourteen ecological areas, providing habitats for various wild animals and plants.
It is one of the major attractions in South Africa and is also considered the flagship attraction of South Africa National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, this park has daily conservation and entrance fees.
Perhaps it would be more cost-effective to purchase a Wild Card combo ticket, which allows you to enter certain selected parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is the origin of the name of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and is also a tourist attraction for many travelers.
Some say the row of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline, set against the backdrop of Victoria Harbour, looks like a glittering bar chart.
To appreciate the best views of Hong Kong, you can leave Hong Kong Island and head to the Kowloon waterfront across the harbor.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the newly reclaimed land along the northern coast.
The British colonists claimed this place as their own, so if you want to find evidence of colonial history on this land, here is a good starting point.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast to the inland of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans Forest has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The area located within India is known as Sundarbans National Park.
This forest not only includes mangroves, but also a part of the once extensive, now nearly extinct, great forest that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Xundabans Forest covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, with approximately one third being water or marshland.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and the area is estimated to be home to 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
The bus runs all day from the local bus station (across the river), but most of the buses will leave between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those heading to the east and Jakarta / Bumtang.
It is recommended that you purchase bus tickets several days in advance as the minibuses often reach full capacity.
Most areas can be reached by the comfortable and sturdy Japanese Coaster bus.
Carpooling taxis is a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Palau (150 Nue) and Punaka (200 Nue).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge spanning the Oyapock River, connecting the Brazilian Oiapoque and the French Guiana's Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock.
The two towers are 83 meters high and 378 meters long, with two lanes of 3.5 meters wide each.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The project was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to open to traffic in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs inspection station is expected to be completed.
The Guaraní people are the most important indigenous group living in the eastern part of present-day Paraguay, leading a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle while also practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chake area is the homeland of other indigenous tribes such as Gualu and Payagua, and these indigenous people make a living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay (formerly known as the "giant province of the Indies") was born from the encounter of Spanish conquerors and indigenous people.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain many local characteristics and appearances.
Argentina is famous for having one of the top polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest event of the year will take place at the polo field in Las Cañitas in December.
Other smaller championships or competitions will also be held at other times of the year.
Please contact the Argentine Polo Association for event-related news and ticketing information.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands is located in Stanley, opposite the "Falkland Islands Company (FIC) West Store", and is the only place where currency can be exchanged.
On the islands, British pounds are generally accepted everywhere, and credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted within the Stanley area.
Outlying islands may be able to use British and American currency, but credit cards may not be accepted; please inquire with the merchants in advance to determine which payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange its currency outside of the Falkland Islands, so be sure to exchange it before leaving.
Due to Montevideo being located south of the equator, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region, with temperatures often exceeding 30 degrees Celsius in the summer.
The winter there may sometimes deceive people with its coldness, as the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the wind and humidity make it feel much colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no specific "rainy season" or "dry season", and the rainfall is roughly evenly distributed throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals are ultimately wild, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authority pointed out that people should maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may appear, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals have aggressive tendencies.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured because they fail to maintain a proper distance. These animals are large in size, untrained, and have potential danger, so please give them enough space.
In addition, be aware that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so please avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling foods, and maintain a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of close to 40,000 people.

Except for one British ship, all other ships have sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful rally organized by the Mau movement to fight for independence.
Auckland spans two harbors, thus boasting many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in 3 different areas.
The North Coast Beach (Beigang District) is located along the Pacific coast, stretching from the northern Changwan to the southern Dewen Port.
Those places are almost all beaches where people can swim safely, and most of them have the shade provided by New Zealand Christmas trees.
Tamaki Drive beach is located in the Whitemata Harbour, between the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay in central Auckland and St. Helier's.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, with rows of shops lining the shore. It's very safe to swim here.
The main local beer is "First", it is not a complex tasting beer, but a smooth and refreshing beer. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are also many French wines, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may withstand long-distance transportation better.
The local tap water is very safe and can be consumed directly, but if you are not confident, it is also very easy to buy bottled water.
To Australians, "white coffee" is a foreign concept. A shot of coffee is known as "espresso," while a cappuccino is coffee topped with a hefty dollop of whipped cream (not frothy milk), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian standard. The juice is very expensive, but very tasty.
Many people travel to the Great Barrier Reef throughout the year, and few people get injured there.
Tourists still need to listen to the authorities' advice, follow all the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, box jellyfish appeared near the beaches and estuaries in the north of 1770. Outside of these times, their traces can also be occasionally found.

The activities of crocodiles in the ocean are not active, their main habitat is the northern river mouth of Lockampton.
Booking in advance can make travelers feel at ease, knowing that they have a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies usually collaborate with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodations through the travel agency, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually provide package tours that include breakfast and transportation to and from the airport, and even offer combined flight and hotel packages.
If you need time to consider the proposal or collect other documents for your destination (such as visas), they can also hold the reservation for you.
However, if there are any issues that need to be improved or any requests, you should contact the travel agency first, rather than directly contacting the hotel.
During some festivals, most of the visitors to music festivals choose to camp on site, and many of them consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to watch the event up close, you must go in early and find a camping spot near the music performance.
Please remember, even after the main stage's music performance ends, the music festival's performances in other areas may continue into the late night.
For families with young children, some festival venues will arrange exclusive camping areas.
If crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, please make sure of the position of your cabin, as for the cabins most affected, crossing the floating ice will produce a very terrifying noise.
The St. Petersburg cruise itinerary includes city sightseeing. Passengers on board do not need to hold a visa (check relevant regulations).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to keep guests stay longer and spend more. They often have no windows and clocks, and it's hard to find the exits there.
They usually provide special meals, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and make them stay on the premises.
Some places may offer free alcoholic drinks. However, getting drunk can reduce judgment, and good gamblers are very clear on the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who wants to drive in high-altitude areas or on mountain roads should consider the likelihood of encountering snowfall, ice, or temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and you cannot drive as you would on regular asphalt roads.
During the blizzard, a large amount of snow can fall in a very short time, enough to immobilize you.
Snowfall or blowing snow, condensation or ice formation on the car window may all lead to reduced visibility.
On the other hand, in many countries, the ice and snow climate is very common, and traffic is almost unimpeded throughout the year.
Hunting safaris can be said to be the most attractive tourist element in Africa, and it is also the highlight of many visitors' journeys.
The term "Safari" generally refers to the exploration of magnificent African wildlife, particularly through land travel to observe grassland flora and fauna.
Elephants and giraffes often approach cars, so standard equipment can help you see more clearly.
Lions, leopards, and cheetahs are sometimes afraid of people getting close, so it is more suitable to use binoculars to observe.
A wilderness trek (also known as jungle trekking, wilderness hiking or hiking) includes mountain climbing, and the length of the trip can be a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Several events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, with the last one being held in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may be facing a bit of a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary among different businesses, but most cancellation policies set due to the new coronavirus did not extend to July 2020, the original date of the Olympic Games.
Most of the event tickets are expected to be priced between 2,500 and 130,000 Japanese yen, with general admission priced at around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes helps to dry them out. Many hotels will lend you an iron and ironing board even if they are not provided in the guest rooms.

The stretch of road between Boonville and Fairmont, passing through many remote and desolate areas, is considered the most difficult section to drive on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, please stay alert: steep slopes, narrow roads, and sharp turns are the majority.
The speed limit notice is significantly lower than the previous and next sections of road, typically 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 kilometers per hour), and it is even more important to strictly adhere to these speed limits than other road sections.
But what is interesting is that the mobile communication services here are much stronger than other sections along the way, such as in the wilds of Pennsylvania.
German pastries are very delicious, while the pastries in the state of Bavaria are rich and diverse, similar to their southern neighbor Austria.

The stirrups are used to support the rider's feet suspended on both sides of the saddle.
They can bring more stability to the rider, but there is a safety concern that the rider's foot may get stuck.
If a knight falls off the horse and gets one foot stuck in the stirrup, they could be dragged when the horse runs off. To minimize this risk, many safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most of the knights wear high-heeled and flat-narrow soled riding boots.
Furthermore, some saddles (especially English saddles) are equipped with safety handles, which allow riders to pull backwards when falling off the horse, causing the stirrups to detach from the saddle.
Kochamogu Valley - Chile's premier rock climbing destination, known as the "Yosemite of South America," boasts a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.

The sport of mountain skiing, including both alpine and snowboarding, is very popular. It involves attaching skis or a snowboard to the feet and sliding down terrain covered in snow.
Skiing is a popular travel event for many people, who are sometimes called skiing enthusiasts. They plan their entire vacation around skiing and stay in specific locations.
The concept of skiing has been around for a long time, with cave paintings depicting skiers dating back to 5000 years ago.
Skiing can be traced back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians established the first leisure skiing club in Australia.
Ski backpacker: This activity is also known as alpine skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
This activity is similar to alpine skiing, but typically does not involve high mountain skiing and climbing. Both activities are carried out in steep terrain and require sturdier skis and boots.
Imagine the ski route as a similar hiking route.
When conditions are good, the distance for skiing with a heavy load on snow will be slightly longer than walking, but you rarely achieve the speed of backcountry skiing without a load on a clear snow trail.
The European continent, though relatively small, is home to many independent countries. Typically, traveling between several countries means having to apply for multiple visas and undergo multiple passport checks.
However, in this respect, the operation mode of the Schengen Area is like that of a country.
As long as you stay in this area, generally speaking, you do not need to go through the passport control checkpoint again to enter or exit the border.
Similarly, if you hold a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa from each Schengen member country separately, saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universally accepted definition for what constitutes an antique in terms of man-made objects. Some tax authorities define antiques as objects that have a history of over 100 years.
Different geographical areas have different definitions, and in places like North America, the age limit may be shorter than in Europe.
Handicrafts, although they have a shorter existence time compared to other mass-produced products of the same type, may still be considered antiques.
For the Sami people, raising reindeer is an important livelihood, and for many other skilled Sami people, the peripheral culture of reindeer husbandry is equally important.
However, even in tradition, not all Sami people are engaged in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but instead make a living from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and view reindeer as draft animals for pulling and carrying.
Many Sami people are now involved in modern industries. The tourism industry is an important source of income for the Sami region.

The course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, extensive first aid training, and sometimes weapon training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are very common, but publications about war zones are rare.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must bring valid return documents.
Not every government is willing to issue passports without indicating gender (X), or to update documents for individuals desiring specific names and gender.
There is a great deal of variation in the extent to which governments are willing to recognize these documents.
After September 11, 2001, the search work at the security checkpoints became more stringent.
Transgender individuals who have not undergone surgery should not expect to pass through scanners without compromising their privacy and dignity.
Offshore currents are waves that break and turn back after hitting the beach, usually occurring near rocks or similar areas.
According to the underwater topography, the returning waves will concentrate in a few deeper areas and may create rapid currents flowing towards deeper waters.
Most deaths occur when people exhaust their strength attempting to swim against the current back to shore, with a very slim chance of success.
Once you are out of the current, swimming back to shore is not any more difficult than usual.
Try to swim towards a place where you won't be trapped again, or, depending on your swimming skills and whether someone has noticed, you can also wait for rescue.
The speed of the emergence of reverse cultural impact is faster than cultural impact (less honeymoon period), and it lasts longer and is more serious.
For tourists who easily adapt to new cultures, sometimes it can be particularly difficult to readjust and integrate into their own native culture.
After living abroad for a period of time and returning to your home country, you have already adapted to the new culture and forgotten certain habits formed by the domestic culture.
When you first arrive abroad, others will usually treat you with patience and understanding, knowing that it takes time for a newcomer to adjust to a foreign country.
But for returning travelers, people may feel that there is no need to worry and understand them again.

The picture is presented on the pyramid, while the lights illuminate the other pyramids.
Several countries claim the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, as their territory, with the most bases on the island, there are sixteen bases in use in 2020.
This archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, the location of the human settlement of Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, the latter being a broken volcano crater of an active volcano that was flooded to form a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellesmere is located to the south of the peninsula, and is bordered by the Beaufort Sea.
The mountain ranges on the peninsula converge here into a highland, then re-emerge to form the 360-kilometer-long Ellesmere Range, divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The tallest mountain range in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, has an elevation of 4892 meters and is located in the northern part of Antarctica, also known as the Sentinel Range.
In remote areas where the mobile phone signal cannot reach, you may only be able to use satellite phones.
In general, satellite phones cannot replace mobile phones because you need to be outdoors and aiming at the satellite to make a call.
Ships (including pleasure boats and exploration vessels with remote data and audio needs) often use this service.
You should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service as a local telecommunications service provider.
For those planning a gap year, the increasingly popular choice is to travel and learn.

Finland is a great place for canoeing. Finland, also known as the "land of a thousand lakes," is home to thousands of lake islands or coastal archipelagos.
In islands and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Though the coastal islands and the largest lake are indeed large enough for any yacht, small boats, and even kayaks, can provide a different experience.
Rowing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
The corresponding countries are Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but in other regions it appears to be quite different (for example, in the Netherlands, the ratio is 1 in 40).
Most Baltic cruise itineraries will make a stop in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
In other words, you can spend several whole days visiting this historic ancient city and return to the boat for overnight stay in the evening.
If you are participating in shore excursions on board a cruise, you do not need an additional visa (up to 2009).
Some cruise itineraries introduce Berlin in their brochures. As shown on the map above, Berlin is not located by the sea, so the cost of visiting this city is not included in the cruise fee.

The express delivery company quickly delivers goods and charges handsome rewards for this. Time is usually very important when transporting business documents, goods, or urgent repair parts.
Larger companies have their own aircraft on some routes, but it's more troublesome for other routes or smaller companies.
If they use air shipping to send things, it may take several days to complete the unloading and customs clearance on certain routes.
The only way to get faster delivery is to send the goods as checked baggage. Airlines prohibit sending non-passenger baggage as checked baggage, so here is your chance.
To get on first class or business class, the most direct way is to bring out a thick stack of cash to enjoy the privilege (or an even better way is to have the company pay for it).
However, this is not cheap: roughly calculated, you probably need to spend four times the price of an economy class ticket to purchase a business class ticket, and eleven times the price to purchase a first class ticket!
In general, trying to find discounted business or first class seats on direct flights from point A to point B is usually futile.
Airlines are well aware that there are some core customers in the market who are willing to pay high fees in exchange for quick and comfortable arrival at their destinations.
