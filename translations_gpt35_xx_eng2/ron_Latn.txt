This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs were covered in feathers, an already widely spread hypothesis, but it provides details that generally cannot be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the fur of this animal was brown-chestnut on the upper part, with a light or orange color on the lower part.
The discovery also provides insight into how bird feathers have evolved.
Due to the fact that dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed axis, called rachis, but present other characteristic elements of feathers - barbs and barbules - researchers have concluded that the rachis was probably an evolutionary development that appeared after the other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for regulating temperature or for display. Researchers have suggested that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not chick fluff.
Researchers have suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not the down of a chick.

Brightness and rotation are used in combination to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to stimulate the observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would have been caused by the tidal forces produced between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing the tides, in the same way the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
: Scientists have managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matters in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that the dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy as a kind of aura and is made up of a lot of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the presence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
"In an interview, he stated that the new variant is 'very disturbing and concerning due to the very high rate of mortality'."
It is possible that some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, says Dr. Moll, and at least 2 of them were hospital medical staff.
During the course of a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom they are in close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the overall group of people with tuberculosis seems to still be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 infected individuals at any given time in South Africa.

The infrared images show that the temperature differences between night and day indicate the probability that these are caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which generally maintain a constant temperature, but it is compatible with the hypothesis that they represent deep holes in the ground,” said Glen Cushind from the Astrogeological Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a somewhat technical experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed paper in an envelope on which they indicate which candidate they have chosen.
After officials verify the voter's identity, they leave the envelope in the ballot box and sign the voting list.
The French electoral law rather strictly codifies the procedures to be followed.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can confirm that there are no ballots at the beginning of the vote and that no ballots are added, except for those of properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send their representatives to witness all stages of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following clear procedures.

The deceased are Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old. Cuddeback was the driver.
Edgar Veguilla was injured in the arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will need reconstructive facial surgery.
Uka's weapon malfunctioned while aimed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, can't see with one eye, is missing a section of his skull, and has his face reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider's testimony was taken via a video link from a USAF base located in his home country.
After Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the Championships.
The first test she participated in was the slalom, where she didn't reach the finish line on her first attempt. 36 out of 116 competitors achieved the same result in that race.
In the other race she participated in, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting group, with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first place finisher, Australian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the competitor in ninth place, Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers from the seated position event failed to finish their run, and 45 out of the total 117 slalom giant skiers failed to secure a spot in the competition.
The police in Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya stated: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and we have recovered her cell phone and laptop."
Accusations goes by the names Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed until the emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been accused of killing her son at the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh.
She was detained pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be altered, as her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other areas of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and the courts have ruled that publishing the photos can be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee observes that "journalists seem to be playing with fire by publishing photos and other information about suspects".
The Crown Prosecution, which is responsible for criminal prosecution, has informed journalists that it will not make any further comments at least until the indictment.
According to the leaked information, the document will refer to the dispute regarding the borders, which Palestine wants to be drawn based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a sacred place for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel claims that, after signing the agreement, they should have a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while the PA agrees to accept this presence only for a period of five years.
The hunters who took part in the additional test for pest control were to be closely monitored by forest rangers, with the test being monitored and its effectiveness being evaluated.
Within a partnership between NPWS and the Sports Hunters Association from Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers have been recruited, based on the hunting program of the Sports Hunters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Executive Director for Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS Park, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety briefings and training.
Martelly took the oath yesterday in front of a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), made up of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth Chief of Staff in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests, which began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to organize elections, some of which were supposed to take place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating iPods that are malfunctioning have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) has stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple reported an additional 34 incidents of overheating, which the company said are "not serious".
"The Ministry responded, saying that the postponement from Apple is 'truly regrettable'."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at local time 07:19 (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office declared that no damages have been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there are no indications for a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been saved and so far the death of at least six has been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were earlier released, alongside Filipino photographers.
Later, photographs replaced an elderly woman who needed the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He pursued obstetrics studies and in 1959 started working for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature labor in his free time.
His research has shown that if a hormone were to be administered, it would accelerate the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders, also known as "black boxes," on Wednesday.
The wrestling brothers also paid tribute to the Moon.
"Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager. Luna died two months ago. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman.'"
Dustin Runnels, also known as "Goldust," commented, "The Moon was as eccentric as me... maybe even more... I love it and will miss it... hopefully it's in a better place."
From 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated, during the 2010 campaign for the federal elections, that in her opinion, Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II comes to an end.
34% of those interviewed agree with this opinion, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of those questioned believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medalist at the Olympics was supposed to swim at the Commonwealth Games, in the 100m and 200m freestyle events, as well as in three relay races, but his physical condition was put into question due to his complaints.
He couldn't take the necessary medication to control the pain, as they were prohibited during the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Several individuals have checked the discovery before the beginning of February, using different combinations of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water supply for Earth, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, as comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, aged 53, began his governance at the beginning of this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to rumors as representing "political blather and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to cover shorter distances, thus saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
Use technology that relies on the use of satellites, as opposed to older ground-based radar systems, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and transmit more precise information to pilots.
Extra transport means are not available, surface trains do not stop at Wembley, and park and ride facilities are not available in the area.
. Fears about the lack of transportation options have brought up the possibility of organizing the game behind closed doors, in the absence of the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the development of a new species of birds on the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer, due to the breeding between the endemic Darwin finches, Geospiza fortis, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into a multitude of designs. It can be rolled into tiny objects.
It can be drawn into thin wires that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and stuck onto another metal. It can be made so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can prepare an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical substance.
The hydrogen ions are protons from which the electrons have been removed (given that hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders together, and then, with clean and wet hands, form a ball from them.
The moisture present on the hands will react with the outer layers, which can give you a strange sensation and lead to the formation of a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also toilets. Among the Romans, toilets were sometimes found as part of public baths, which men and women used together.
When you call someone thousands of kilometers away, you do it through a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and vision.
A huge rocket, 100 feet tall, is needed to take a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel has given us is to provide much simpler and faster transportation.
The train, car, and many other means of transportation have been brought to us.
Underneath them we have several medium-sized felines, which feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Ultimately, there are many small felines (including free-roaming pet cats) that consume much of the smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the niche concept; each cat has its own role to fulfill, so they are not in competition with others.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called prides.
The families are formed by one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and offspring.
The females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion families behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals with surprisingly similar behavior to lions (but not to other large felines), and also very deadly for their prey.
Complete athlete, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, can make leaps over long distances, and can pull with a force five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tigers belong to the same group (the Panthera genus) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger does not resemble the full-throated roar of a lion, but rather a sharp, piercing sentence of words.
Ocelots like to consume small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, or birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots hunt and find prey using their sense of smell, sniffing out the area to locate them.
Thanks to their night vision, they can see very well in the dark and can move undetected. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into the environment and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it crosses a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island from where it cannot easily return), it will often find itself in a different environment than it was before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they needed before.
The initial population has not changed at all, it needs the same adaptations as before.
As time passes, as the new population adapts to the environment, its members begin to show less and less similarity to the other population.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we will no longer be able to say they are the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and represents a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which people exhale (i.e. release from their lungs).
Plants produce their food with the help of the sun through photosynthesis. In addition, they provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. The majority of the food we eat is from plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, having nothing to fear except for other mosasaurs.
His long jaws had over 70 sharp teeth like blades, along with an additional set in the roof of his mouth, which means that nothing that appeared in his path escaped unscathed.
We don't know for sure, but it could have had a bifurcated tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other species of mosasaurs, and it's even possible that it may have been cannibalistic.
Also, it attacks anything that enters the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex could have fought it.
While much of their cuisine would be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive dishes, which included wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that, while poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, wealthy men liked to have banquets where they lay on one side while eating.
The ancient Roman cuisine could not include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians were building a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of that god.
The people were bringing sacrifices to the gods, while the priests were trying to respond to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were also built.
The summit of the tower was the sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was less important.
The majority of an Jewish family's life took place outdoors.
Women used to cook in the yard; the shops were just counters that opened onto the street. Stone was used in the construction of the houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely colonized. In the Scandinavian saga, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for a crime, and while traveling further west, he found Greenland and named it so.
However, regardless of the discoveries he made, tribes of Eskimos were already living in those places at that time.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences in terms of population, kings, customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might believe that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it's not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
"On the back of the declaration of independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" can be read. The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document."
Although it is not known with certainty who wrote it, it is still known that, at its beginnings, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) had been kept rolled up.
Therefore, the marking was probably made simply for labeling.
The landings on D-Day and the battles that followed liberated the northern France, but the south was still not free.
He was led by the French from Vichy. These were French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, American forces, alongside the Free French, had liberated the south of France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, being related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and to civitas, meaning city or city-state; it also defines in a way the size of the society.
The city-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizing culture involves the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a persistent cultural imprint, and a reasonable spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - the Congress being its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, because there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to implement its decisions.
Furthermore, he did not have the authority to annul laws and fiscal tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be modified, and the states treated the central government with such ease that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, are ranked second in the list of the most successful teams in the world and were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians taking part in international competitions and Olympic events.
In Japan there are almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
"Thanks to the island groups it has, Japan is often said to be, geographically speaking, an ‘archipelago’."
The beginning of Taiwan took place a long time ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island recorded the name as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the production practices of the aboriginal cereals and employing Chinese workers to work on sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644 - 1912) take control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declare Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1985, after the defeat in the first Sino-Japanese war (1984-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to allow tourists to get a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common static photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is produced nowadays, but more importantly, its proportions have been taken over by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format, somewhat confusing, is actually 36mm in width by 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore stated to be 3:2.
Many standard formats (such as the APS format family) are identical or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often abused and ridiculed, is nothing more than a simple suggestion to create dynamism, while still maintaining some order in an image.
According to this, the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the frame into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, drew attention to itself.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound the European states together, despite the differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power has affected everyone, from king to the common mortal.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the monetary funds of the church exist specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has made many people wonder if the principle was truly respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, interrupting the supply of vital military and civilian provisions, although this blockade violated the provisions of generally accepted international law, as outlined in several international agreements signed in the last two centuries.
Great Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire ocean areas, even endangering neutral ships.
The response to this tactic being reserved, Germany expected a similar reaction in the case of its relentless submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the predominant attitudes of the majority of citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of the ongoing First World War, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to work at Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with only 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delineating different time periods; each stage of China or each family holding power represented a distinct dynasty.
Similarly, the periods between consecutive dynasties were marked by divided provinces. The most well-known period of this kind was the Three Kingdoms Period, spanning 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods fierce wars took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting to occupy the throne in the magnificent palace at Xi'an.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an absolutist system to a republican, nationalist one, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, men were able to access all occupations, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
Similarly with the military, as instead of a hierarchy based on class, they now based it on caliber.
The French Revolution, in turn, inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohamed was deeply interested in things that went beyond the worldly. He used to go frequently to meditate in a cave that came to be known as "Hira", located on the "Noor" (light) Mountain.
The cave itself, which has survived over time, allows us to form a vivid picture of the spiritual inclinations of Mahomed.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is hard to find even when you know its existence. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
The only things that can be seen are the clear and beautiful sky above and the surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be glimpsed or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that has remained standing to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
"The Giza Plateau, also known as the "Giza Necropolis", in the Valley of the Kings, Egypt, houses several pyramids (among which the great pyramid is the tallest), several smaller tombs, a series of temples, and the Great Sphinx."
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
"The "upward stroke" marking looks like a V, while the "downward stroke" marking looks like a staple or a square missing the bottom side."
Up means you need to start from the top and push the bow; down means you need to start from the frog (that is, the part you grab the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
An upward bow stroke usually generates a softer sound, while a downward stroke is stronger and more determined.
Do not hesitate to mark your own indications, but remember that the printed indications for bowing techniques are there for musical reasons and should normally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thérèse aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a crowd of market women to return from Versailles to Paris.
They moved back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting and screaming threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, someone from the crowd lifted the head of a member of the royal guard, killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen's eyes.
The war expenses of the US imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to bear a large part of the expenses and interests related to the bonds issued in the name of the Filipino government through the banking houses on Wall Street.
Of course, the enormous profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, representing the era in European history that encompasses the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally end around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by a corresponding logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely outside of cultural and political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the ownership costs of cars.
A large number of car owners leads to an increased incidence of accidents on public roads, which necessitates the invention of new medical techniques for healing bodily injuries.
An important component of romanticism was cultural determinism borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography has shaped individuals and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography have emerged, and these, being in harmony with the society's place, have been better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital in the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
His reputation as a center of luxury began to spread around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
His status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned laden with gifts such as silk and spices more prized than what the markets of Byzantium offered.
This was the moment when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th - 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West can be 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important advancements during that period was that, as a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture done to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often ecological system that uses saved seeds, originating from the same ecological region, alongside crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
From a historical perspective, the majority of farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this still happens in many developing countries.
Subcultures gather individuals with similar thinking, who feel marginalized by society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinct and symbolic use of characteristic style, including fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, as a result of neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults as they were growing up.
Romanian sentence: "Astfel de copii sunt numiți «neîmblânziți» sau sălbatici. Unii copii sălbatici au fost sechestrați de oameni (de regulă de către proprii părinți); în unele cazuri, abandonul copilului s-a datorat respingerii lui de către părinți, din cauza unor deficiențe intelectuale sau fizice severe." English translation: "Such children are called "untamed" or wild. Some wild children have been kidnapped by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the rejection by the parents, because of severe intellectual or physical disabilities."
It is possible that feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; and others are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
The wild child, when raised entirely by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (within their physical limits) almost entirely like those of the animal that cared for them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a little further.
The scaffolding or construction site method is not a method of learning, but rather a support that provides assistance to people going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are included in the software, aiming to query, provide hints, and explain procedures that might otherwise be too complicated for a student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in family care for numerous reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, even extending to extortion.
There should not be children who grow up in an environment where they are deprived of food, love, and education, but there are.
We perceive the foster care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our family care system must provide safe accommodation, caring caregivers, solid education, and reliable medical assistance.
Family caregiving is presumed to cover the needs of the children, which were not met in the house they were previously in.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet introduce additional dimensions in terms of approaching types of uses and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
The personal involvement and the continuous relationships have also been identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated the public's reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in interpreting micro expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that one can observe if a person is lying through the accurate interpretation of facial microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work "The President's Speech", showed how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately evaluate sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, while selection eliminates them from the set of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination cause each generation's direction of variation to be dominated by one or the other of the two genetic pools.
In the savanna, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to meet its amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
In addition, failure to do so brings serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources were the proteins from leaves and legumes, but these are hard to digest for primates like us if they are not cooked.
Unlike these, animal-origin food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also offers large amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Taking all this into account, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a similar way to the chimpanzees in today's savannas.
Disruption of sleep is the procedure by which you intentionally wake up during the normal sleep period in order to go back to sleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into a conscious state without fully waking you up.
If you happen to reset your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking fluids (especially water or tea, which have diuretic effects) before bedtime, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.
The inner peace a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in someone's body and spirit.
With lower tension, the life force is more positive. Everyone has the possibility of finding absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is their own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, to which the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga have been added.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Yoga Kundalini, meditation, and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is represented by Deity Yoga. By visualizing different deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes, and culture led to the distancing of the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War was beginning.
It was supposed to last for forty years and it will be fought seriously, by "delegated" armies, on battlefields spread from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By the 17th of September 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
The plans, however, became almost useless overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union were put into motion, creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading eastern Poland, violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is by far the most efficient way to transport both goods and people across the oceans.
Traditionally, the role of the navy has been to ensure a country's ability to move people and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples in this regard was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in occupying Great Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
Goats are thought to have been domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them near the house in order to easily have access to milk, wool, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, usually in the care of goatherds who were often children or teenagers, similar to the well-known shepherds. These methods of herding are still used to this day.
Wagonway-type roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although these wagonways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than they could on the slightly more uneven roads of that time.
The sleepers were introduced quite early on, to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually concluded that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal strip on top.
This has become a widespread practice, but iron has led to faster wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In the end, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails entirely made of iron were produced.
The first known means of transportation was walking; people started walking in an upright position 2 million years ago, with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, usually did not walk in an upright position.
Bipedal specialization is evident in the fossils of Australopithecus dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus may have already been bipedal seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the ecological movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and should deactivate them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot as a result of scientific and technological progress, and the problems are greater now because of overpopulation and mankind's extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house, located a few streets away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 children were made, known as "Dunlap posters."
On July 8, the first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 remaining Dunlap posters are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
But in birds, many characteristics similar to dinosaurs can still be seen.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Practically, all computers used today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can contain only one of the two values, namely 0 or 1, and the name of these numbers is binary digits or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis may not be possible.
The best clue for internal poisoning could be the presence of an open container of medications or household toxic chemicals.
Consult the label for first aid instructions regarding that particular poison.
The term "beetle" is used by entomologists specifically for this group of insects.
The term has its origin in the ancient resemblance to bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs are nidicolous, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), meaning it is the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
SM is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research showed that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple can come to the conclusion that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of the child.
These couples can choose to formulate an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of adoption, the natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works, using the scientific method. This method is applied in most scientific research.
It is not the only one however, experimenting and an experiment represents a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, addressing questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers have mainly used classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
His ideas about all aspects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West woke up separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which do not represent simple responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in the majority of living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that will continue to function for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment represented one of the most important pieces of evidence in support of the hypothesis that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, a type of viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They have conducted two experiments by labeling either the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germline cells or not.
Only mutations in germ line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in any other part can cause cell death or cancer.
Organized tourism centered around nature exploration attracts people interested in visiting natural settings to enjoy the scenery, including wild animals and vegetation.
The examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example would be visiting, photographing and learning more information about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave by car from the small rural settlements to go to their workplaces, passing by others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this carbon-heavy economy has disrupted the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the past 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of dissatisfaction with water quality or bridge collapse are rarely encountered.
Why do transportation systems give rise to such dissatisfaction, why do they fail day after day? Is it because transportation engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something more serious going on?
The traffic flow studies the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the way they interact with each other.
Studying the traffic flow is unfortunately difficult, as drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with absolute precision.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to remain reasonably constant; as a result, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be mathematically approximated.
To better represent the traffic flow, we need to establish relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for the planning, designing, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to start flying. The ability to fly allowed them to more easily avoid enemies and find food and mating partners much more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the body.
This offers them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some believed he was right, but many believed the opposite; namely that the Solar System actually revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable because we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries over 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching a width of six miles in some places.
No less than 20 percent of the water flowing into the planet's oceans comes from the Amazon rivers.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in size and technical construction mastery.
The ancient Egyptians who lived during the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments built by their predecessors, which at that time were already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by the majority of those who work in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known since ancient times some fundamental chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, because these can be found in nature in native form and are quite easily exploited using simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, formulated a theory according to which everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were water, earth, air, and fire.
He rather recalled the four states of matter, (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, even though he theorized that it transforms into another substance to take the form we see.
Alloys are actually combinations of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
The elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You will see that some alloys can also include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
All that is found in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became the friend of many after it was created.
Unfortunately, as newer writing tools emerged, the pencil lost its status and number of uses.
People are now writing messages on computer screens without ever needing to put their hand on a sharpener.
You can't help but wonder what will be the fate of the keyboard when something newer will appear.
The fission bomb operates on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart uphill. Breaking the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no impulse.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km in the near part and 100 km in the far part.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker in higher relief areas.
There might be more magma in the nearby area, as the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
The content theories are focused on identifying the elements that capture people's attention or bring them pleasure.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
These theories study what drives some people to want to do what they do, and what specific things in their environment can determine whether they do or do not do certain things.
Two popular theories regarding content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of behaviors can arise when managers start leading their former colleagues. One extreme consists of trying to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulties in making unpopular decisions, in carrying out disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, people are turning into unrecognizable individuals, believing that they must change everything the team has done and proceed in their own style.
In the end, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Many times, this behavior leads to rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
The virtual members of the team often have the role of providing a point of contact for the physical group they are part of.
Many times they have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) also represents a unique component of a virtual team.
"The invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When in the functional departments of an organization all available resources are used efficiently, creativity and ingenuity can manifest freely.
As a result, the process through which an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative process for meeting the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as being a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
The data from neurobiology represent physical evidence that underlies a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. As such, it allows for narrowing the scope of research and defining it more precisely.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate previously unseen structures and processes of the brain.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models, which help us understand the processes that take place in our mind.
Despite the fact that AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI is a very important part of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and adaptation of intelligence in machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
The examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such actions have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, but it has also been used in several software applications for personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of any class. Often, a teacher would be pleased to take their students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while in the classroom.
The virtual sharing of a field trip is also an excellent way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is remodeled, while the previous versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve the student's written expression. While students often start their blogging experience with negligent grammar and spelling, the existence of an audience generally has the gift of changing the situation.
Given that students often represent the most critical audience, the blogger starts making efforts to improve their writing and to avoid criticism.
"Furthermore, blogging 'obliges students to be more aware of the surrounding world'. The need to respond to their audience's interests inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004)."
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their study far beyond the usual school day.
"The proper use of blogs can help students think more analytically and critically; by actively responding to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of what others have written, as well as shape their own perspectives on certain issues." (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada, offering a range of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further to the south lies Niagara Falls, while the north hosts the pristine natural beauty of the Muskoka district and many more.
These and many others highlight Ontario as representative of what foreigners consider to be quintessentially Canadian.
Large portions further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost wild and uninhabited.
To make a comparison between populations that has the gift of surprising many: the number of African Americans living in the USA is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a true standalone continent when it comes to wild animals.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are renowned as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam into those lands, which had great success in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and European colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the maritime route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders with the Sahel, and to the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman traveling should say that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's good to wear a wedding ring, but it shouldn't look expensive.
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can lead to what may be considered harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be decisive when refusing a man and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it still doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, being named Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, who rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, but abandoned it again in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given by Spanish merchants who had established their commercial base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and all kinds of trinkets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the extreme east, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets of the settlement, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is a fairly safe place, for visits outside the city, an effort of information is necessary in order to understand the stage of the ongoing fights in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, also offering some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking trips in Africa.
In Goma, boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) can be used for getting around. The usual (local) price for a short trip is around 500 Congolese francs.
"Alongside its relative inaccessibility, 'Timbuktu' has come to be used metaphorically to mean exotic, distant places."
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat posed by desertification.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in a strong contrast with the rest of the country's cities, as it has more of an Arab feel than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the emblem of the national parks in this country (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It could also be helpful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry either to a series of parks in South Africa, or to all national parks in South Africa.
The name of the territory of Hong Kong is given by the island of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists see as the central point.
The exhibition of buildings that contribute to the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a bright bar chart that is enhanced by the presence of Victoria Harbor waters.
For the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon, on the other side of the water.
The largest area of the developed urban part of Hong Kong Island is crowded on reclaimed land along the northern coasts.
This is the space that the British colonizers have appropriated and therefore for anyone looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching over 80 km (50 miles), from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just swamps with mangroves - they also include some of the last strongholds of the vast jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², of which approximately one third is covered by water/marsh.
Starting in 1966, Sundarbans became a sanctuary for wildlife, and it is estimated that currently there are 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses that connect the districts are often full, it is advisable to purchase a ticket several days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby destinations, such as Paro (150 Nu) or Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge. It stretches over the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
With the two pylons rising to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011 and was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully functional in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní represented the most important indigenous population group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region also hosted other groups of indigenous tribes, such as Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
"Paraguay, formerly called the "Gigantic Province of the Indies", was founded in the 16th century after Spanish conquistadors encountered indigenous groups."
The Spaniards began the period of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the city of Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve a good part of its indigenous specific and identity with efforts.
Argentina is renowned for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Tours and smaller matches also take place here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where you can buy tickets for polo games, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is set as equivalent to 1 British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the island, situated in Stanley right across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted all over the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards probably won't be accepted, although they will probably accept British and American currency; contact the owners in advance to find out what payment methods they accept.
It's almost impossible to exchange the Falkland pounds outside of the country, so you need to exchange them before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it's summer there when it's winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures frequently reach over 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the presence of wind and high humidity has the combined effect of making the perceived cold more intense than the thermometer indicates.
"There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation remains fairly consistent throughout the year."
Even though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must keep a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, the bison, elk, bear, and almost all other large animals can attack humans.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep the proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so it's best to give them their space.
In addition, be careful that odors can attract bears and other wild animals, so it would be advisable to avoid strong smelling foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of the state of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a naval confrontation of sad memory in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the fight for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to the fact that Auckland is situated between two harbors. The most famous of these are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district), located on the banks of the Pacific Ocean, stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches, where one can swim safely, and most of them have shade from the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata port, in the market suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the center of Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, with a wide range of shops along the shore. It is safe to swim.
The main local beer is "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
Many French wines can be found, but the New Zealand or Australian ones would go better.
The local tap water is drinkable, but if you have concerns, you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is unusual. A short black coffee is called "espresso," cappuccino comes with plenty of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian quality standards. The fruit juices are pricey, but very good.
Many visit the reef all year round, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
Follow the authorities' advice, respect all signs, and pay special attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is encountered near beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. Occasionally, it can be encountered outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are scared of humans and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles don't actually live in the ocean, their main habitat being in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance offers the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, but through a travel agent you can also make reservations for other types of accommodation, such as camping grounds.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation, or even packages that combine flights and hotel accommodation.
Also, they can hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any modifications or requests must first be addressed to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and most participants consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will need to arrive early to snag a camping spot near the music.
Remember that, even though the music on the main stages has ended, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, pay attention to the location of the cabin, as navigating through ice produces an unbearable noise for the most sensitive ones.
The cruises in St. Petersburg also include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the obligation to obtain a visa (see conditions).
As a general rule, casinos make every effort to maximize the time spent here by customers and the money they spend. There are usually no windows and clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
Usually, they have special offers for food, drinks, and entertainment, to keep the good mood and guests to stay in the place.
Some establishments offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication affects judgement, and good players know how important it is to stay lucid.
Who will drive at high latitudes or through mountain passes must take into account the possible presence of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, the friction is low and you cannot drive as on dry asphalt.
During a blizzard, in a very short interval, enough snow can fall to block you.
Visibility can also be limited by falling snow, blizzard, condensation, or ice formation on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic runs uninterrupted for the most part throughout the year.
Probably, safaris are the main tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari, as commonly used, refers to land expeditions undertaken to see the amazing wild animals of Africa, especially those in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, and the standard equipment will allow for a good visibility of them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you will be able to see them better using binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called a 'bush walk', 'hiking safari', or 'on foot') consists of hikes, either for a few hours or for several days."
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the 1964 Olympics, will be the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympics.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may face a complicated situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, the cancellation policies for reasons related to coronavirus did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets to events will cost between 2500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, with regular tickets costing around 7000 ¥.
Stepping on wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron available or if you don't like to wear wrinkled socks, then you can try using a hair dryer if you have one handy.
Be careful not to let the material get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against certain specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others, more minutes are required.
The filters differ in terms of efficiency, and if you are worried, consider the option of buying water in closed bottles from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers can encounter pests they are not familiar with at home.
The pests can alter the food, can cause irritation or, in severe cases, can cause allergic reactions, can spread venom or can spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can harm or kill a person using physical force are not generally considered harmful.
The duty-free shopping offers you in certain places the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers who are about to visit countries with high taxes can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult traffic conditions along the entire length of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often crossing through isolated and undeveloped areas.
If you are used to driving on country roads, don't lose control: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and dangerous curves prevail.
Speed limits are significantly lower than those in the previous sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and it is all the more important to be strictly respected.
However, quite oddly, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other portions of the trail, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German pastry products are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Bakery products with fruits are common, with apples being used throughout the year, and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Often, popular pastries go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastry products, taste what, depending on the region, are called Berliners, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be 'dry' or 'liquid' depending on the amount of liquid."
In the inland regions of northern India and in Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry sauces; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a broad term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
Used without any other qualifiers, however, the term tends to indicate the original food from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a variety of simply spiced dishes, with the predominant flavors preferred by Javanese being peanuts, chili pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stairs support the rider's legs, hanging on either side of the saddle.
These provide better stability for the rider, but can pose safety issues, as it is possible for a rider's feet to get stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the saddle but remains with one foot caught in the stirrup, the horse can drag him when it starts running. To minimize this risk, a series of precautions can be taken.
First and foremost, most horse riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by a rider falling from the saddle.
Cochamó Valley - the most sought-after place for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of granite walls and high peaks.
The peaks offer stunning views from their summit. Climbers from all over the world continuously chart new routes among the walls with unlimited potential.
Sports that involve descending on snow, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down the snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums" in English, who organize entire vacations around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is extremely old - we have cave paintings depicting skiers dating back to before 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Hiking with a backpack on skis: This activity is also called ski touring, backcountry skiing or ski mountaineering.
It is a related activity, but usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering tours, the latter being carried out on much steeper terrains and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover distances somewhat longer than walking - but very rarely will you be able to reach typical speeds for cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on well-groomed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, traveling through multiple countries would mean going through the visa acquisition and passport control procedures multiple times.
In this sense, the Schengen Area is organized in a way that resembles a single country.
As long as you remain in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to do so at passport control points.
Similarly, those who have a Schengen visa do not need to obtain a visa for each of the individual Schengen member countries, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that establishes what manufactured articles are antiques. Some tax agencies consider goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition varies depending on the geographical location, where the age limit could be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
The reindeer herding is an important source of income among the Sami, and the culture related to trade is also important for many who have other professions.
However, traditionally not all members of the Sámi population have been involved in the large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived off fishing, hunting, and the like, using reindeer more as pack animals.
Nowadays, many Sami people have modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the Sami area.
"Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word 'gypsy' is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and an incorrect perception of the Roma population."
If the country you are about to visit is subject to a travel warning, it may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consider the advice of other governments than your own, but their advice is intended for their own citizens.
An example would be how American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is just a short summary of the political situation in a country.
Opinions are often presented in a superficial, general, and overly simplified manner, compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Extreme weather conditions" represents a generic term used for any type of dangerous meteorological phenomenon, which has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruptions, or loss of human lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and come in various forms, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, abundant precipitation, and uncontrolled fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as well as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be cautious of the risks of severe weather affecting the area, as it could disrupt their travel plans.
It is recommended that anyone planning to travel to a country that may be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A search on the Internet for "hostile environment training" will probably provide you with the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will address in much more detail all the issues discussed here, usually through practical experience.
A training will usually last between 2-5 days and will include role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapon training.
There are plenty of books and magazines that cover wilderness survival, but few publications that address war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery in another country must ensure they have valid documents for their return trip.
The opening of governments to the possibility of issuing passports on which sex (X) is not declared, or to update documents to correspond to the desired name and sex, is variable.
The availability of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
The searches at the checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to go through scanners without their privacy and dignity being affected.
Return currents represent the flow of return to the ocean from the waves breaking on the beach, often at a reef or similar formation.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and there can form a rapid current towards the deeper waters.
Most of the deaths occur due to exhaustion in attempting to swim back against the current, which can prove to be impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming is not more difficult than usual.
Try to maneuver towards a position where you are not caught again and, depending on your abilities and whether or not someone has seen you, you may want to wait to be rescued.
The shock of returning home manifests more quickly than the cultural shock (persists less from the honeymoon phase), has a longer duration, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes encounter difficulties in readjusting to their native culture.
If you were to come back home after living abroad, you would have already adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your native culture.
When they had just left for abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, aware that visiting a new country involves a process of adaptation.
The world does not always expect patience and understanding to be necessary from travelers returning home.
The sound and light show organized at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the entire area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the start of the show.
Usually you can constantly hear the noise made by tourists and vendors. The sound and light show seems to be taken out of a fairytale book.
The Sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
The region in the southern part of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea, is called Ellsworth Land.
The mountains of the Peninsula unite to give birth to this plateau, then separate again to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, called the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains in Antarctica, with Vinson Massif and Mount Vinson rising to 4892 m.
In isolated areas, without phone signal, a satellite phone could be your only option.
A satellite phone generally cannot replace a cellular phone because you need to be outside with an unobstructed view of the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is widely used in maritime transportation, including recreational boats, as well as by expeditions that require remote data and voice transmission.
The local telephone service provider could provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular alternative for people planning a gap year is to combine travel with study.
It is a popular activity especially among graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before attending university, without jeopardizing their educational journey.
In many cases, enrolling in a year of staggered courses abroad may even increase your chances of accessing higher education in your home country.
Normally, there is a tuition fee that is paid upon enrollment in these educational programs.
"Finland is a wonderful place for rowing. The 'land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, both in these lakes and in the coastal archipelagos."
In archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos off the coasts and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national recreational activity, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
This happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is from 1 to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days in a row, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you travel on land only on excursions aboard a ship, you will not need a separate visa (starting from 2009).
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is definitely not close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they are flying for the first time or have had a traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not different from personal fears and dislikes towards other things, which many people experience.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works, and what happens during flight, can be helpful in overcoming fear based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast deliveries. Often, delivery time is essential for documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies own their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they sent something by air, on some routes it may take days for the unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to make it pass faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to pay a large stack of money for this privilege (or, even better, to convince your company to do this for you).
It's not cheap, though: in general, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare in business class, and up to eleven times more in first class!
In general, it doesn't even make sense to look for discounts for business class or first class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere fast and comfortable, in which case they charge fees according to the requirements.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from inter-ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in the eastern region of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
The economic links between these two parts of Moldova have been restored, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion of Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the second port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
At one time the ancient city of Smyrna, is now a busy, developed and modern commercial center, situated around a huge gulf and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, alongside the glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centers, are equipped with traditional red tile roofs from the 18th century, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that rather resembles the Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above some graves.
It's worth spending half an hour walking through this amazing village.
To the north, easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which has become known beyond the country's borders following an enthusiastic review of its splendors made by Lord Byron.
The Scottburb 403 bus runs regular routes to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you can also visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place known worldwide for the apparitions of St. Mary.
Please note that, in principle, you are visiting a common grave site, as well as a site that has almost immeasurable significance for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived internment there, and many more who had family members who were killed or forced to work to death there, both Jews and others.
You are kindly asked to treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the place by drawing and scratching on existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most panels are produced only in Catalan, as this is established by law as the first official language.
Spanish is, however, widely used in public transportation, alongside other services.
The periodic announcements on the subway are made only in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are announced by an automated system in different languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The Parisians are known for being egocentric, impolite, and arrogant.
Although it is often just a stereotype that does not conform to reality, in order to have a pleasant stay in Paris, it is good to behave as well as possible, as someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will help you to navigate with much more ease.
The reserved attitude of Parisians quickly turns into a friendly one if you show a minimum of politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, mostly with beech, fir, and spruce trees, and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It hosts a considerable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different types of soils, and altitudinal levels.
The region also hosts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare wildlife such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be found here, along with many other more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer coverings for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a bright colored one, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Men must also wear pants that cover their knees.
And these can be borrowed from those available at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all for men!
The cuisine in Majorca, like that in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, greens, and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used abundantly.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes, with any available seasonings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word "Sie," which means "you," always begin with a capital letter, even within a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
Also, undoubtedly, it makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to discover the possibility that a verb or an adjective may be used in a nominalized form.
The pronunciation of Italian words is relatively easy, most of them being pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters you need to be more careful with are c and g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel after them.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar manual will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the phrases.
Obviously, those who know a Romance language will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know some Spanish may jump to the premature conclusion that Portuguese is close enough that it doesn't need to be studied.
Pre-modern observatories are generally outdated nowadays and remain open as museums or educational places.
During their heyday light pollution was not as much of a problem as it is today, so they are usually located in cities or on campuses, making them more easily accessible than those built in our times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations located in remote areas with favorable weather conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been an integral part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the chosen flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy of the imperial Court.
Plants never look better than in their natural environment, so don't give in to the temptation to pick even "just one" of them.
If you visit a formally landscaped garden, collecting "specimens" will also lead to your expulsion, without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, where you can easily navigate and buy almost anything as soon as you arrive there.
"However, being in the 'upper tropics', just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to face both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when it's clear, less often)."
There are also several buses that go north to Hebron, the place where, according to tradition, the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were buried, alongside their wives.
Check if the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not to Kiryat Arba, the nearby Jewish settlement.
Internal waterways can be a good theme for organizing a vacation.
For example, visiting the castles along the Loire Valley, along the Rhine Valley or taking a cruise to sites along the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions related to this holiday have been adopted by both non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians all over the world.
There is a tradition to spend the night of Easter awake, outdoors, to see the sunrise.
For this tradition there are of course explanations in Christian theology, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
The more traditionalist churches often organize an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during Holy Week, congregations often gathering at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that initially reached the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the distance from the continent, mammals failed to undertake the journey, resulting in the giant tortoise being the main animal grazing in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the areas in the Arctic or Antarctica during winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon line.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be, more or less, dark at that time.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not, therefore, often a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture has a stronger hierarchical and more formal character than that which Westerners are accustomed to.
The suits represent the standard clothing in the business environment, and coworkers address each other using the last name or job title.
Workplace harmony is an essential element, placing emphasis on group effort rather than individual accomplishments.
Workers often need to obtain approval from superiors for all decisions they make and are expected to follow the instructions of their superiors without question.
