This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also conveys detailed points such as color and three-dimensional arrangement, which are generally not found in fossils.
According to scientists, the feathers of this animal are chestnut brown on the outside and warm-toned on the inside.
This discovery also served as a clue to explore the evolution of bird feathers.
Researchers speculate that the lack of well-developed shafts called rachises on dinosaur feathers, as well as the presence of down feathers and barbs, indicates that the evolution of rachises may have occurred later than these other features.
From the structure of the feathers, it is inferred that they were not used for flight purposes, but for temperature regulation and visual effects. Researchers suggested that despite being a tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen exhibited adult feathers, indicating that they were not down feathers of a chick.
Researchers suggest that despite this specimen being a young dinosaur's tail, it has adult feathers instead of juvenile feathers.

Candidates can have representatives present for any part of the process. In the evening, the ballots will be counted by volunteers under strict supervision according to specific procedures.

Mr. Hune will resign, and it is planned that Ed Davey, a member of the House of Representatives, will succeed him in the cabinet. It is expected that Norman Lamb, a member of the House of Representatives, will take the position of Minister of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, which will become vacant with Mr. Davey's resignation.
Mr. Hoon and Mr. Price are scheduled to appear in Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16th.
The deceased were Nicholas Olden (25) and the driver, Zachary Cadback (21).
Edgar Begira suffered injuries to his arm and chin, while Christopher Schneider sustained severe injuries requiring facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon was aimed at the head of the fifth man and it failed. Schneider is in pain, has lost sight in one eye, part of his skull is missing, and his face has been reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via video link from his home country's US Air Force base.
After the Wednesday event, Carl Payne participated in two individual races at the championship.
The first race was a slalom, but she retired after the first run. 36 out of 116 athletes had the same result in this race.
In the other race, the giant slalom, she finished 10th in the women's sitting group with a total time of 4 minutes 41 seconds 30, 2 minutes 11 seconds 60 behind the first place Claudia Loesch of Austria and 1 minute 09 seconds 02 behind the 9th place Gyongyi Dani of Hungary.
In the women's sitting group, 4 skiers were unable to complete the run, and in the giant slalom, 45 out of 117 people were unable to rank.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Police Inspector D.K. Arya stated, "We have arrested 5 men for raping a Swiss woman and recovered her cellphone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Lompro Kanjar, Gaja Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendant appeared in court with a concealed face.
At the time of the car collision, three people were inside the house, but there were no injuries.
However, the driver suffered a severe head injury.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed until the ambulance rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge later.
Mr. Adekoya has since appeared in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court on suspicion of killing his son.
She has been detained until prosecution and trial, but there is a potential risk of compromising witness testimony due to the wide publication of her photo.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish judicial system is different, with courts potentially considering the publication of photographs to have a negative impact.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dandy University points out that journalists who publish photos of suspects are crossing a dangerous bridge.
The Criminal Division of the Royal Court, which handles prosecution entirely, has indicated to the press that they will not make any further comments until at least the prosecution is carried out.
According to leaked information, the document in question refers to border disputes, and Palestine's hopes are based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East war.
It has been reported that the future of Jerusalem as a sacred entity for both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley are being addressed.
Israel is demanding a continued presence in the valley for 10 years if the agreement is reached, while the Palestinian Authority has only agreed to a 5-year presence.
Participants in the auxiliary pest control test received strict monitoring by rangers, as the test was supervised and its effectiveness evaluated.
Through the partnership between NPWS and the New South Wales Sports Shooting Association (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited for the sports shooting association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flannigan, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters chosen for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in as the new interim Electoral Council (CEP) composed of 9 members.
For Martelly, this is the 5th CEP in 4 years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the previous European Commission as part of measures to move the country towards new elections.
This committee was a response from President Martelly to the widespread protests by the opposition that started in October.
The protest, which sometimes turned violent, occurred after the scheduled elections were not held, starting in 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating issues have been reported with malfunctioning iPods, resulting in a total of 6 fires and 4 people suffering minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan announced that they are aware of 27 incidents related to the same equipment.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 cases of overheating incidents, stating that they were "not serious."
The prefecture responded by saying "it is really regrettable" about the Apple report delay.
This earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT on Friday).
According to the Emergency Management Office (EMO) of the Northern Mariana Islands, there have been no reports of widespread damage.
According to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there were no signs of a tsunami.
In the Filipino capital of Manila, a former Filipino police officer has hijacked a bus and taken Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Roland Mendoza fired at tourists with an M16 rifle.
Many hostages have been rescued, but at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released early, and Filipino photographers were also released.
The photographers wanted to use an elderly woman as a stand-in for their dirty work. Suspect Mendoza was shot dead.
Regina followed in her father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He received training as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Oakland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Rigins began researching premature birth in his spare time.
His research revealed that administering hormones can accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also showed respect to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. She was also my first manager. Luna passed away on a night when two moons appeared. It was a quite unique night just like her. She was a strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was just as abnormal as I am... or maybe even more... I loved her and I miss her... I wish she could be in heaven if possible."
In a survey of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposing the republicanism of Australia increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Julia Gillard, the interim prime minister, argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should transition to a republic once Queen Elizabeth II's reign comes to an end.
In public opinion polls, 34% of people support this opinion and hope that Queen Elizabeth II will be the last monarch of Australia.
In a public opinion poll, 29% of people believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe it should not become a republic, resulting in extreme opposite views.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but their health is in question due to symptoms they reported.
The necessary medication to control the pain was prohibited in that tournament, so he was unable to take it.
Professor Curtis Cooper, a mathematician at Central Missouri University and computer scientist, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25th.
This discovery was verified by several people using different hardware and software by early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
The comet may have been a source of water supply to the Earth, carrying organic substances that form proteins and support life.
Scientists want to understand how planets were formed, especially how the Earth was formed, since the collision of a comet with Earth a long time ago.
This year, Governor Cuomo, 53, took office at the beginning of the year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called this rumor "political gossip and foolishness".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
FAA claims that NextGen is a system that allows aircraft to fly short-haul routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing CO2 emissions.
We employ satellite-based technology that is in contrast to traditional ground radar technology, allowing air traffic controllers to more accurately identify aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
There is no special transportation provided, and overground trains do not stop at Wembley, and there are no parking lots or park and ride facilities on the surface.
The possibility of being forced to play in a closed venue without the gathering of the team's supporters has come up due to concerns about not having transportation.
A study published in the scientific journal "Science" on Thursday reported that a new species of bird had been born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that this new species evolved in just two generations, but it was thought to take longer because this process was the result of the breeding of the endemic species Galapagos finch and the introduced species cactus finch.
Gold is a metal that can be processed into various shapes. It is also possible to make it smaller by rolling it into a ball.
You can pull it and make it into a wire-like shape, and twist or knit it. It can also become a plate-like shape if you hammer it or roll it out.
You can stretch it very thinly and paste it onto other metals. It can be made so thin that it is used for decorating hand-drawn illustrations called "saishoku shahon".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make test paper with the squeezed juice of red cabbage.
The juice of cabbage reacts to chemicals and changes color depending on whether it is acidic or alkaline (basic).
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H) present in the chemical substance being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has had one electron removed (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Knead together two dry powders, and then firmly squeeze with clean wet hands.
The moisture on the hands reacts with the outer layer, creating a strange sensation and forming a kind of shell.
In cities like Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, they had developed sewer systems, and almost every house had a water-flush toilet.
In the houses of the Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini islands in Greece, remains of sewage systems have been discovered.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also toilets. In the Roman civilization, they were sometimes provided as part of mixed-gender public bath facilities.
When calling someone who is thousands of miles away, the call is automatically routed through a satellite.
Artificial satellites in space receive phone calls and almost instantly reflect them.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. The reason scientists use telescopes in space is because some of the light and scenery entering human sight is distorted by the Earth's atmosphere.
In order to deploy satellites and telescopes into space, a giant rocket of at least 100 feet in height is necessary.
This wheel has unbelievably changed the world. Its greatest achievement is that it has made transportation much more comfortable and faster for us.
Trains, cars, and many other modes of transportation were born from there.
Many medium-sized feline species that eat medium-sized prey such as rabbits, muntjacs, and deer are found in the area.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray cats) that prey on a far larger number of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, where each cat has a special job and does not compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social members of the cat family, living in large groups called prides.
Pride is made up of 1-3 related males and over 30 females and their offspring.
Normally, females are related by blood and form large families consisting of sisters and daughters.
The pride of lions shows behavior similar to that of wolf and dog packs, and surprisingly, lions (as well as other large cats) have remarkably similar hunting behaviors, not letting their prey escape.
A physically well-proportioned and highly athletic tiger can climb, swim, leap long distances, and pull with the strength of five sturdy humans, although not particularly gracefully.
The tiger belongs to the same animal group (Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. Only these four species of large felines are able to roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the roar of a lion, but more like an intimidating threat.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals such as monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if possible. Most of the prey ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots search for and chase after animals (prey) that have passed by sniffing the ground.
With its excellent night vision ability, the ocelot is good at silently moving around. It blends in with its surroundings and pounces on its prey to hunt.
When a small group of living creatures (with few individuals) move away from the larger group they belonged to (for example, by crossing mountains or rivers, or moving to a new island where they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, different resources and different competitors exist, so new groups may require different characteristics and adaptations than those previously needed, and there is the potential to become powerful competitors.
The original group has not changed at all and still requires adaptation just like in the past.
When a new group begins to adapt to a new environment, over time, it begins to show aspects that are different from other groups.
Eventually, after thousands to millions of years, the two populations will have such different appearances that they cannot be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (as breath).
Plants produce nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis. They also create shade.
We build our houses with plants and make clothes from plants. Many of the ingredients we eat every day are from plants. Animals cannot survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so there was no one to fear other than other Mosasaurus.
There are over 70 sharp teeth lined up in that long jaw, and there is another row of teeth in the palate, so there is no escape once you pass through here.
I don't know for sure, but it may have been a forked-tongue. There is also a possibility that it ate turtles and large fish, in other words, it may have been a cannibal and eaten other Mosasaurus.
"Also, anything that comes into the water will be attacked, and even huge dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus will not stand a chance."
Most of their food is familiar to us, but the Romans ate delicacies and exotic foods such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference is that while poor people and women sit in chairs to eat, wealthy men prefer to recline and relax while dining at banquets.
In ancient Rome, it is unlikely that ingredients from America and Asia, which arrived in Europe over the next few centuries, were incorporated into their meals.
For example, ancient Romans who never tasted turkey because there were no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa there.
The Babylonians built a first temple for each of the gods, which was considered as the house of the gods.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to fulfill the desires of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, followed by the inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, a pyramid-shaped special tower called a ziggurat is built as part of a temple complex.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.
For people living in the warm climate of the Middle East, homes were not as important.
The Hebrew family mostly lived outdoors.
Women were cooking in the garden, and the shops were nothing more than street-facing stalls. Stones were used in the construction of the houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large-scale forests, so timber was very expensive and precious.
Greenland was a sparsely populated area. According to Nordic legend, a man named Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and discovered Greenland when he headed west, and named it Greenland.
However, regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribe was already living there at the time.
Regardless of which country, they are all "Scandinavian," but the national characteristics, monarchy, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were quite different.
People who have seen the movie "National Treasure" may think that there is a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that was not the case. Although something is written on the back, it was not a treasure map.
The title written on the back of the Declaration of Independence was "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The title is written upside down at the bottom of the document.
It is unknown who wrote it, but it is known that this large parchment (measuring 29.75 inches x 24.5 inches) was stored in a rolled-up state during its early practical use.
Therefore, the addition of the label as a mere notation is often seen.
The landings of D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part had not yet been liberated.
The rulers were the French people of "Vichy". They made peace with the German army in 1940, and were French people who cooperated with the invaders rather than fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces invaded southern France, and this invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just 2 weeks, the American and Free French forces liberated southern France and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization is the culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, in other words, society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin adjective civilis, meaning "of or relating to citizens," the Latin noun civis, meaning "citizen," and the noun civitas, meaning "city or city-state," and in some way defines the scale of society.
The city-state is the predecessor of the nation-state. Civilization and culture mean the inheritance of knowledge across generations, the continuity of cultural legacy, and fair dissemination.
Cultures that deviate from the mainstream often disappear without being recognized as formal civilizations, and as a result, historical evidence is not preserved.
During the War for Independence, the 13 states first formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, with the federal Congress as its sole constituent.
The parliament did not have the authority to tax and there were no national executive or judicial institutions, so the parliament relied on the state authorities for all its actions, but the state authorities were often uncooperative.
There was also no authority to invalidate interstate tax laws and tariffs.
Amendment of the clause required unanimous consent from all the states, but representatives often absented themselves because the states looked down on the central government.
: The Italian national soccer team is the second most successful team in the world, alongside the German team, and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
The popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
In the northern region, winter sports are popular, producing Italian athletes who compete in international competitions and the Olympics.
In Japan, there are about 7,000 islands, with the largest being the Honshu Islands, which are considered the 7th largest in the world.
Japan is often called an "archipelago" due to its collection of islands.
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors named this island "Ilha Formosa" (Beautiful Island).
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, revolutionized the grain production methods of the indigenous people, and employed Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) army occupied the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan as a province of Qing China.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) in 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki and ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: the sundial (Intiwatana), the Temple of the Sun (Torreon), and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex facilities have been rebuilt to give tourists a better understanding of the traditional appearance.
Machu Picchu had been restored to 30% by 1976, and continues to be restored today.
For example, the most widely used still image photography film format in the world is 35mm, which was the mainstream film size towards the end of the analog film era.
It is currently being produced, but more importantly, its aspect ratio inherits the format of digital camera image sensors.
Confusingly, the 35mm format actually has dimensions of 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
Therefore, this aspect ratio of 3:2 (obtained by dividing by 12 and finding the most simple whole number ratio) is said to be the most simple.
Many common recording formats, such as APS-based recording formats, have this aspect ratio or something close to it.
"Some people may underestimate the "three-point lighting" method, but it is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining the order of the image."
The most effective placement for the main subject is considered to be the area surrounded by the intersection of lines dividing the image into thirds (see example).
The Catholic Church, which became economically wealthy and powerful in European history, began to attract scrutiny during this era.
Christianity has been connecting European countries with different languages and customs for over a thousand years.
That universal power influenced everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity is that wealth should be used for the purpose of alleviating suffering and poverty, and the church's funds are a special presence for that purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and funds has led many people to question whether its doctrines are being fulfilled.
Shortly after hostilities began, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
This blockade, while effective in disrupting the supply of critical military and civilian goods, violated established international law that had been codified through numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain laid sea mines in the open sea to prevent ships from entering the maritime area, and even posed a danger to neutral ships.
Due to the limited reaction to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
The ideology that was prevalent among most citizens and the state in the 1920s was pacifism and isolationism.
During World War I, each country witnessed the horror and brutality of war, and hoped that such a situation would not happen again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla emigrated to the United States to work for Edison company in New York.
Armed with a collection of poems and a recommendation from Charles Batchelor (my former boss), I came to America with almost no money.
In ancient China, there were unique ways to indicate the difference in eras, and each stage in Chinese history, or the families that held power, became distinctive dynasties.
Between each dynasty, there were unstable periods in the divided regions. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In such times, many nobles fought fierce battles over the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of warriors fighting for supremacy in the struggle for the highest position in the grand palace in Xi'an.
The adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, patriotism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and not to a single ruler, had many social and political influences.
After the revolution, job positions became open to all men through public recruitment, and the most motivated and successful candidates were able to secure employment.
The same can be said in the military. This is because the ranking in the military is based on ability rather than rank based on military rank.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed working class in other countries, and revolutions began in each country.
Muhammad had a deep interest in issues beyond everyday life. He often visited a cave called "Heera" in the "Noor" mountains for meditation.
The cave that has survived through the ages vividly reflects the spiritual devotion of Muhammad.
The cave is located on a mountain peak north of Mecca and completely isolated from the outside world.
In reality, even knowing about the existence of caves, it is not easy to find them. When you enter a cave, it is a completely isolated space.
I can see nothing but the clear beautiful sky above and many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, the outside world is hardly visible and the sounds of the outside world cannot be heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C., is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the deceased pharaohs.
In the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, there are many pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid of Giza), several small tombs, temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid is a colossal tomb built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples surrounding it are dedicated to Khufu's wife and family.
The mark of the upbow looks like a V shape, and the mark of the downbow looks like a stapler needle or a shape with a missing bottom edge of a square.
Up is starting from the tip and pushing the bow, and down is starting from the frog (the hand position where the bow is held) and pulling the bow.
The up bow generally produces a soft sound, while the down bow produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
You can write symbols freely with a pencil, but remember that there is a musical reason for the printed curved symbols. Normally, you should follow those symbols.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister Princess Elizabeth were forcibly returned from the Palace of Versailles to Paris by the women who had turned into a mob at the market.
They rode in a carriage and returned to Paris, surrounded by rioters shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd, turned into a mob, forcefully opened the carriage window of the king and queen.
One time, in front of the terrified queen, one of the rioters shook the head of a royal guard who had been killed in the Palace of Versailles.
The Filipino people bore the cost of the American imperialist war for the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government in order to cover a large portion of their expenses, and were also required to pay the interest on bonds that had been sold in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the excess profits obtained from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would have constituted the foundational benefits of US imperialism.
In order to understand the Temple Knight Order, it is necessary to understand the context in which its hierarchy was born.
The era in which this incident occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, generally corresponding to the period of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (around 1000-1300 AD) in European history.
The medieval period is considered a division of historical periods between the early and late medieval periods, and it is customary to consider the late medieval period to have ended by 1500.
The theory of technological determinism encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technology promotion and technological norms to the strict meaning that human destiny is driven by the underlying logic related to the manifestation of scientific laws and technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general arguments. One is that the development of technology itself follows a path that greatly exceeds cultural and political influences, and the other is that technology is not socially conditioned, but rather has an "influence" on the inherent society.
For example, it could be said that automobiles inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, with just a handful of cars, the nationwide road network is not profitable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The increase in car ownership leads to an increase in the occurrence of road accidents, resulting in the development of new technologies in the medical field to treat injured bodies.
In Romanticism, there existed a major element of cultural determinism formed by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and customs and culture related to that geography emerged over time, harmonizing with the society, and were superior to imposed laws.
In the modern world, just as Paris is known as the fashion capital, in feudal Europe, Constantinople prospered as the fashion capital.
The reputation as the center of extravagant costumes began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
In the 12th century, mainly due to the Crusaders returning with more valuable gifts such as silk and spices from the markets of Byzantium, their status declined.
The title of being the fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris at this time.
The peak of Gothic style was during the 10th to 11th centuries and the 14th century.
The original attire was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to slow communication routes, there is a possibility that the Western European style may be 25-30 years behind.
As the end of the Middle Ages approached, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advancements at the time, resulting from the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a form of agriculture that produces only the food necessary for the agricultural workers and their families.
Self-sufficient farming is a simple system that aims to maximize yield by combining saved seeds from the local ecosystem with crop rotation and other relatively simple technologies, often in the form of organic agriculture.
Historically, the majority of farmers have engaged in self-sufficient agriculture, and this trend is still seen in many developing countries.
Subculture is a culture that gathers people who feel that they are being ignored and undervalued by society's standards, so that they can cultivate their own individuality.
Subculture characteristics may be determined by the age, ethnicity, class, location, gender, and other attributes of its members.
The defining characteristics of subculture may be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of these elements.
Members of subculture often showcase their membership through an iconic and unique style that includes fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to highlight the few unfortunate cases of children whose adaptation to society by adults during their growth process has been hindered by child neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse.
Children like this are called "wild children" or "feral kids". Wild children may be confined by a person (usually their own parents), and in cases of child abandonment, parents may refuse to care for a child with severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse and trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some are said to have been raised by animals, while others are said to have survived on their own in the wild.
Wild children raised by animals other than humans often exhibit behaviors similar to those animals, such as fear of humans or indifference towards humans, within (physical) range.
In project-based learning, learning should be made easier and more interesting, but scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a means to support people using new computer programs, starting new projects, and having new learning experiences.
There are both virtual and real scaffolding. In other words, teachers are one form of scaffolding, as are Microsoft Office's clip people.
The virtual scaffold is incorporated into this software with the goal of enabling students to ask questions, receive instructions, and explanations about procedures that they may find difficult to understand on their own.
The reasons why children are placed in the foster care system vary from child neglect to abuse, and even extortion.
Every child should be raised, cared for, and educated in a well-rounded environment, but feral children are raised in an environment without that.
The foster care system is recognized as a safe haven for these children.
The foster care system aims to provide a safe home, loving childcare, quality education, and dependable medical care.
In the foster care system, it is required to provide all the necessary items that were lacking in the previous household before being taken in.
The internet is an environment that combines both mass communication and interpersonal communication elements.
The notable characteristic of the internet leads to further dimensions from the perspectives of usage and satisfaction approaches.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for internet usage (James et al., 1995).
The concepts of "personal involvement" and "continuing relationship" were identified as new motivational aspects when Eighmey & McCord (1998) investigated viewers' reactions to websites.
The use of video recording leads to important discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions that last for a few milliseconds, in other words, facial movements.
The claim is that by accurately interpreting microexpressions, one can discern whether the person is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks points out in his essay "The President's Speech" that even those with brain impairments who cannot understand speech can still accurately assess sincerity.
He suggests that such ability to interpret human behavior is common even to animals such as pet dogs.
In 20th-century research, it has been found that there are two gene pools for genetic mutations: hidden and expressed.
New genetic mutations caused by sudden changes will be removed from the pool of mutations expressed through natural selection.
Niche and recombination shuffle mutations back and forth between two pools from generation to generation.
For primates with a digestive system similar to humans, it is difficult to obtain essential amino acids from the plant resources available in the savanna environment.
Moreover, neglecting it leads to serious situations such as growth suppression and malnutrition, ultimately leading to death.
The most easily accessible plant resource was the protein contained in leaves and beans, but this is a nutrient that is difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking.
On the other hand, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easily digestible and are a high-quality source of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Considering all points, it is not surprising that our ancestors, just like chimpanzees living in today's savannah, were solving "protein problems".
Interrupted sleep is the process of intentionally waking up during regular sleep hours and then falling back asleep after a while (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring back consciousness without fully waking up.
When you realize that you keep turning off the alarm unconsciously, you can put the clock on the opposite side of the room so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another method based on biorhythms is to consume plenty of fluids (especially water or diuretic tea) before going to bed, to create a situation where you have to get up to urinate.
The degree to which a person's sense of peace demonstrates is in direct opposition to the degree of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension level, the more positive life force is generated. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that can thwart this goal is the person's own anxiety and negative feelings.
Tibetan Buddhism is a faith based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has expanded by incorporating a lot of techniques from Mahayana Buddhism's compassion and yoga from India.
As a general rule, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of loving-kindness towards all.
Kundalini yoga is a practice that aims to awaken the kundalini (individual soul) by combining yoga poses, breathing, mantras, mudras, and more.
The center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. By visualizing various gods, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is born.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy and led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, the two countries became antagonistic due to clashes in systems, processes, and cultures.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allied countries became enemies, and soon the Cold War began.
After that, it continued for 40 years and real battles by proxy armies were fought in battlegrounds such as Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defense had already been breached, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became a thing of the past almost overnight. After more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army violated the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties (bilateral and multilateral) by invading the eastern regions of Poland, they formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Transporting goods by ship is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across the sea.
The job of the navy has long been to maintain the ability to transport their own citizens and supplies while also effectively hindering the ability to transport enemy citizens and supplies.
As a recent and noteworthy example, the North Atlantic operations in World War II stand out. The United States attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was mainly using U-boats to try to stop this transportation.
If the Allies had been defeated, Germany probably would have been able to conquer Britain just like other European countries.
The domestication of goats is believed to have begun about 10,000 years ago, with its epicenter in the western Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise goats, which were easy to obtain milk, wool, meat, and skin from.
Goat herds were generally allowed to roam freely in hilly and other grazing areas, and it was usually young boys who looked after the goats. This tradition continues to this day.
"In Britain, by the 16th century, goods wagon roads were already being laid."
The railway consisted of parallel laid boards, but it allowed horses to transport larger goods at a faster pace than the rough roads at the time.
The sleepers were introduced at a fairly early stage to securely fix the rails in place. It was gradually realized that efficiency improved when iron tips were provided on top.
This has become common, but iron caused the wear of wooden carriage wheels.
Ultimately, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, all-iron rails were first introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking, and the human's upright walking began 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus ("upright human").
Australopithecus, our direct ancestor, did not have the habit of walking upright for an extended period of time.
Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two feet as early as 7 million years ago, but the characteristic of bipedalism has been confirmed in the fossil of Australopithecus 390-420 million years ago.
You can start living a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, participate in environmental movements, or even become an activist to alleviate future hardships to some extent.
In many cases, this is like symptomatic treatment. However, it is necessary to identify the root cause of the problem and neutralize it, rather than just seeking a temporary solution.
The world has changed significantly due to the progress of human science and technology, and it is clearly evident that problems have expanded due to the excessive population and luxurious lifestyles.
After being adopted by the Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the printing office of John Dunlap, several blocks away.
150-200 copies are now being referred to as "Dunlap Broadside" overnight.
The first public reading of this document was conducted by John Nixon in the garden of the Independence Museum on July 8th.
One letter was sent to George Washington on July 6th and was read to the army in New York on July 9th. Another letter arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 existing Dunlap broadsides are known to be the earliest copies of the existing document. The original handwritten manuscript does not exist.
Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still living today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly in the sky.
However, the appearance of birds still resembles that of dinosaurs in many ways.
It has legs with scales and claws, is ovoviviparous, and walks on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus.
In fact, all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary.
The binary system is represented by either of two values (0 or 1) and these numbers are called binary or bits for use in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not become apparent immediately. Since symptoms such as vomiting are common, a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The most obvious sign of internal poisoning is the presence of open containers of medications or toxic household chemicals.
Please check the label of the poison for specific first aid instructions related to that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "insect" in a formal sense when referring to this group of insects.
This name originates from the fact that bedbugs with high adaptability have been infesting sleeping spaces as harmful pests since ancient times.
Bedbugs and cockroaches are both adapted to living in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
In the United States, it is said that there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and it is known as a typical neurological disease in young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
According to research, it has been found that the probability of women developing multiple sclerosis (MS) is twice that of men.
Some couples may decide that child-rearing is not beneficial for either the parents or the children.
Such a couple can utilize the adoption system for the baby.
In adoption, the biological parents lose their parental rights and another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main purpose of science is to elucidate the mechanisms of the world through the scientific method. In fact, this method serves as the guiding principle for most scientific research.
However, that's not all. An experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, and asking questions or making observations also serves as a guideline for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers paid attention to classical texts, especially the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greece declined, Western countries realized that they were becoming disconnected from the philosophical and scientific roots of Greece.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often critically dependent on the existence of endogenous periodicity and are regulated through the body's internal clock.
The circadian rhythm has been recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, not just as a response to external periodic cues.
The internal clock is an autonomous oscillator that continues to circulate freely for a certain period of time without any external signals.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the compelling experiments that suggested that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used a phage (virus) to transplant its DNA into bacteria.
They attempted two experiments, one to label the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus, and the other to label the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Sudden mutations may have various different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material fragments, and whether the affected cells are reproductive cells or not.
Only mutations that occur in germ cells are inherited by children, while mutations occurring in other parts may potentially cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism that emphasizes interaction with nature has been attracting people who are interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery including wild animals and plants.
Examples of activities in the field include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and conducting information surveys on ecosystems.
As an example, visiting the orangutans in Borneo and taking photos or learning about them can be mentioned.
Every morning, people leaving a small countryside town and heading to work pass by those who work near their hometown.
In this dynamic round-trip transportation, everyone is connected to a transportation system based on their own cars in some way, and supports it.
Science now shows that it has removed the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution over the past 2 million years through this large-scale carbon economy.
People living in society use transportation. Almost everyone is dissatisfied with the transportation system.
In advanced countries, complaints such as water quality or bridge collapses are rarely heard.
Why do public transportation systems generate such complaints and have frequent breakdowns? Are the engineers of public transportation incompetent, or is there a more fundamental issue at hand?
The study of traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because it is impossible to predict the driver's actions with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a consistent range of rationality, so the flow of traffic tends to have a certain level of rational consistency, which can be roughly represented mathematically.
A relationship has been established between the three main characteristics of flow, density, and speed to more accurately represent traffic flow.
These relationships will be helpful for the planning, designing, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the sky. The ability to fly helped them evade enemies and efficiently find food and mates.
Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
This widens the range of narrow spaces for hiding from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a scholar named Aristarchus said that the solar system is moving around the sun.
There were some people who recognized his theory as correct, but many others believed the opposite, that in the solar system, the sun (and other stars) revolve around the Earth.
I don't feel like the Earth is moving, so it seems to make sense, doesn't it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. Its water flow surpasses the second largest river by 8 times.
The Amazon River is the widest river on Earth, with some locations reaching a width of 6 miles.
20% of the water flowing from rivers on Earth to the sea comes from the Amazon River.
The main stream of the Amazon River extends for 6,387 km (3,980 miles). This river gathers water from thousands of small rivers.
The construction of the stone pyramid continued until the end of the old kingdom, but the pyramids of Giza surpassed others in their size and technical excellence in construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments built over a thousand years earlier.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the world's smallest independent country and also the country with the fewest population.
In Vatican City, Italian is used in laws and official communications.
In the Vatican City, the language most commonly used by people working there on a daily basis is Italian, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of Vatican City are all Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been highly valued by people since ancient times, and they can all be found in their natural form in nature and relatively easily mined with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed the theory that all things are composed of mixtures of one or more of the four elements. The four elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This is close to the four states (in this order) of matter: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but his theory also posited that they can transform into new substances that form the observable world.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more types of metals. Please recall the many elements listed on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Furthermore, those containing trace amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon are also classified as alloys.
Everything existing in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atom is so unimaginably tiny that there is a possibility that trillions of atoms could fit at the end of this sentence.
At that time, the pencils that came out into the world were good friends for many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing styles, the status and usage of pencils have declined.
Nowadays, more and more people are entering messages on computer screens, and the need for pencil sharpeners has disappeared.
I can't help but wonder what will happen to the keyboard if an even newer one comes out.
The principle behind nuclear bombs is that it requires energy to gather many protons and neutrons into a single atomic nucleus.
It is like rolling a heavy cart and climbing a hill. When the nucleus is split again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable atomic nuclei, which tend to split apart with little provocation.
The lunar surface is made of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
The bottom of the sea is thin, and the underside of the highland is thickening.
The crust is thin, so there may be more ocean nearby. Lava was more likely to rise to the surface.
The content theory focuses on finding things that appeal to and tickle the hearts of people.
These theories suggest that as people reach adulthood, they internalize specific needs and desires.
These theories consider the motivation for certain people to want to do specific things on a daily basis, and the environmental factors that either make them do or not do specific things.
The two content theories that are considered conventional are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when a manager is in charge of their former colleagues, there is a possibility of two types of behavior appearing. One is the behavior of trying to remain "one of the colleagues."
Managers of this type struggle with making unpopular decisions, disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and confirming responsibilities.
The opposite is to become an individual who cannot recognize the person who felt that everything the team has been doing must be changed by their own hands.
In the end, the leader will ultimately be responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This action often causes a rift between the leader and the remaining members.
Virtual teams are expected to have the same level of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the front line for their immediate physical group.
Virtual teams may hold meetings according to the time zone, but such practices are often not well understood by the local management, leading to team members having greater autonomy than traditional team members.
The existence of the true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" refers to the management team that serves as the superior for each member. The invisible team establishes the standards for each member.
Why is it that organizations want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the purposes of practicing organizational learning is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively utilized across the functional sectors of the organization, there is a possibility of fostering creativity and innovation.
As a result, the process of organizations cooperating to overcome obstacles may lead to new innovative processes to meet customer needs.
In order for an organization to be innovative, it is necessary to create a culture of innovation, not just through leadership, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel explains the continuum approach as a method to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance in 2006.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive research. This narrows the research field, allowing for more accurate studies.
The correlation between neuropathology and behavior supports the research of scientists.
Various types of brain injuries, trauma, lesions, and tumors have been known to have an impact on behavior and cause changes in some mental functions for a long time.
The emergence of new technology has enabled us to see and investigate previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This has allowed us to obtain a lot of information and materials that are useful when constructing simulation models to understand human mental functions.
AI forms a very important field in computer science, with a strong SF connotation, processing behavior, learning, and intellectual adaptation by machines.
In AI research, the production of machines that automate tasks requiring intelligence is involved.
For example, there are functions such as control, planning, schedule management, answering customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice recognition, and facial recognition.
Those things have become a separate field focusing on solving real-life problems.
Currently, AI systems are being incorporated into some home computers and video game software, while also being used frequently in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military.
A large part of the class is field trips. The teacher often takes the students to places that cannot be reached by bus trips.
Technology provides a learning method through virtual social science field trips. Students can see museum crafts, visit aquariums, and appreciate beautiful art while in the classroom.
Furthermore, virtually sharing off-campus learning experiences is a great way to reflect on trips and to share experiences in future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their annual trip to the state capital, and the website is revised every year, but the old sites are stored online as scrapbooks for viewing.
Blogs also help improve students' writing skills. Students who have just started writing blogs tend to be careless about grammar and spelling, but having readers can bring about a change there.
Students are often the most critical readers, so bloggers try to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Writing a blog allows me to become more familiar with the world surrounding students. By the necessity of attracting the audience's interest, it leads students to become wiser and more interesting individuals (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that encourages students to collaborate and expand the scope of learning beyond traditional classroom boundaries.
By using blogs appropriately, "students' analytical and critical thinking skills improve. By actively engaging with internet materials, students can define their own position within the context of what others have written, and express their own views on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is an attractive capital of Canada where both official languages are spoken, and there are many museums introducing the past and present of Canada.
To the south, there is Niagara Falls, and to the north, untouched natural beauty including Muskoka spreads out.
Thanks to all of these, Ontario stands out and is considered a truly Canadian province from a third-party perspective.
In addition, there are large areas in the northern region with low population and some untouched wilderness areas where hardly anyone lives.
Many people are surprised by the population comparison: the number of African American people living in America exceeds the number of Canadians.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of the African continent.
Madagascar is by far the largest island and is a unique continent in terms of wildlife habitat.
Most of the small islands are independent countries or countries related to France, and there are also famous luxury beach resorts.
The Arab people also brought Islam to this land, which was widely accepted in Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route to India via the Cape of Good Hope from Europe, from which European influence and colonialism began.
The north is bordered by the Sahel, and the south and west are surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Female travelers are recommended to declare themselves as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring (not too expensive) is effective.
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to acts that are considered harassment, and being followed or having their arm grabbed is not uncommon.
When refusing a man's invitation, let's firmly maintain our position with a confident attitude without hesitation (whether there are cultural differences or not, there is no need to yield to forceful invitations!)
The foundation of the modern city of Casablanca was established by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was known as Anfa. Subsequently, the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinid dynasty utilized this area as a strategic port.
The Portuguese destroyed it, rebuilt it, and renamed it Casa Branca, but ultimately abandoned the town after the earthquake of 1755.
The city was rebuilt as Dar al-Badya by the Sultan of Morocco and renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established a trading post.
Casablanca is one of the most challenging places for shopping in Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, and hookahs, but they are all geared towards tourists.
Sesame is located in the far east near Rwanda, a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, and most of the streets, especially the town center, were buried.
Sesame is fairly safe, but if you plan to visit places other than Sesame, you'll need to investigate and understand the ongoing situation of the conflict in Northern Kivu province.
This city is a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and is also one of the cheapest places in Africa to track mountain gorillas.
You can use a bodaboda (motorcycle taxi) for transportation in Goma. The usual local fare is about 500 Congolese francs for short distances.
The place name "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands, due to its association with being a difficult place to reach.
Tombouctou is currently a tourist destination due to its reputation, and is also a poor town with an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of dangerous world heritage sites to protect from the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops in the PBS special program "Wonders of the African World" produced by Henry Louis Gates.
This city has a strong Arabian influence rather than being a typical African city, and it has a contrasting atmosphere compared to other cities in the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, running along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The area of the park spans 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecosystems, each with different wildlife habitats.
This is one of the main tourist destinations in South Africa and is considered a highlight of South African National Parks (SAN Parks).
Like all national parks in South Africa, this park also requires a daily conservation fee and entrance fee.
Purchasing a wild card can be cost-effective. You can enter most of South Africa's major parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island is a territory of Hong Kong as its name suggests, and it is a popular tourist attraction visited by many tourists.
The buildings lining the Hong Kong skyline are compared to a dazzling bar graph, thanks to the presence of water in Victoria Harbour.
To see the best view of Hong Kong, head from the island to the waterfront of Kowloon.
The city development of Hong Kong Island is mainly concentrated on the reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is a place where British colonial rulers claimed as their territory, so those who want to search for evidence of the colonial era, it would be best to start from here.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove area, spanning 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the inland areas of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans mountain range is registered as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Part of the forest within the Indian territory is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
This forest is not just a swamp with only mangroves growing. It also includes the last remaining place of the vast jungle that once covered the Hindustan Plain.
The area of the Sundarbans is 3,850 square kilometers, with about one-third of it covered by water bodies/wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been designated as a wildlife sanctuary, and currently is estimated to be home to 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axis deer.
The buses depart from the district bus station (across the river) all day, but most buses, especially those heading east and to Jakarta / Bumutan, depart between 6:30 am and 7:30 am.
It is recommended to purchase a bus ticket several days in advance as the bus often becomes crowded.
Most districts are served by Japanese-made coaster buses, all of which are comfortable and sturdy small buses.
It is convenient to use a taxi for moving to nearby places such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. This bridge, which spans the Oyapock River, connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters tall and 378 meters long, with two 3.50-meter lanes on the bridge.
The height of the space above the bridge is 15 meters. It was completed in August 2011 and was not opened until March 2017.
The full opening of the bridge is expected to be in September 2017, around the time when Brazil's customs inspections are completed.
The Guarani people are the most important indigenous group living in the eastern part of present-day Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and also practicing self-sufficient agriculture.
In the Chaco region, there were groups such as the Guaycuru and Payagua tribes, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous people in the 16th century (formerly known as the "giant province of the West Indies").
The Spanish colonial period began and lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asuncion, Paraguay has retained many indigenous characteristics and uniqueness.
Argentina is famous for having the world's best polo team and polo players.
The biggest tournament of the year will be held in December at the Las Canitas polo field.
Small-scale tournaments and friendly matches can also be watched here at other times.
Please check the schedule of the Polo tournament and the ticket purchase location at Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is fixed at parity with the British pound (GBP) at a 1:1 ratio.
You can exchange money at the only bank on the island, located across from FIC West in Stanley.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the island, and Stanley's credit cards and US dollars are also widely accepted.
In remote islands, you can use British and American currency, but credit cards may not be accepted. Be sure to confirm the available payment methods with the owner in advance.
It is nearly impossible to exchange currency for the Falkland Islands after leaving the island, so be sure to do it before leaving.
Montevideo is located to the south of the equator, so when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer, and when it is summer in the northern hemisphere, it is winter.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and temperatures exceeding 30℃ are common in the summer.
It is rare for the temperature to drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity can make it feel colder than the actual temperature indicated by the thermometer.
There are no distinct "rainy" or "dry" seasons, and the amount of rainfall is fairly constant throughout the year.
Many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, but wild animals should still be treated as such, so we should not feed or startle them.
According to park authorities, you must keep a distance of at least 100 yards (100 meters) from bears and wolves, and 25 yards (25 meters) from other wild animals!
Even though they may appear quiet, bison, elk, moose, bear, and nearly all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured because they did not maintain a safe distance. These wild animals are large and potentially dangerous, so let's make sure not to intrude into their territory.
Also, to attract wild animals such as bears, avoid carrying or cooking food with strong odors, and strive for a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This town is located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia became a city in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port is a famous place where navy ships confronted each other when seven ships from Germany, America, and Britain refused to leave in 1889.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost in this battle.
During the independent struggle organized by the Maou movement, the chief executive Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated at a peaceful gathering in town.
Oakland is blessed with two harbors and plenty of beaches. The popular beaches are divided into three areas.
The North Shore Beach (North Harbor district) is facing the Pacific Ocean, extending from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
You can safely swim mostly on sandy beaches, and the shade of the Pohutukawa tree serves as a sunshade.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in the upscale suburban areas of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland, overlooking the Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches that can get crowded occasionally, with various shops lined up along the coast. You can swim safely.
The main local beer is called "Number One," and while it is not a complex beer, it is a refreshing and easy-to-drink beer. Another local beer is called "Manta."
French wine is also easy to come by, but since it's a special trip, let's try the wine from New Zealand or Australia.
Local tap water is completely drinkable, but if you're worried, bottled water is readily available.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white (with milk)" coffee is foreign. Short black is "espresso", and cappuccino is topped with plenty of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Warm chocolate is a drink that meets the standards of Belgium. Fruit drinks are expensive but very delicious.
Trips to the coral reefs are conducted year-round, and injuries caused by the above reasons are rare at the coral reefs.
Nevertheless, please follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings, based on the advice from the authorities.
Box jellyfish inhabit the northern coast and estuaries of 1770 from October to April. They can also be seen at other times of the year.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks swim away in fear of humans.
Saltwater crocodiles do not primarily live in the ocean; their main habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Making a reservation in advance leads to a sense of security for travelers that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Many travel agencies have contracts with specific hotels, but you can also reserve other types of accommodations such as campgrounds through travel agencies.
Typically, travel agencies provide arrangements for breakfast, transportation between the airport and the hotel, or packages combining airfare and hotel accommodations.
Additionally, if time is needed to consider the offer and to obtain other documents (such as a visa) to bring to the destination, the reservation can also be put on hold.
However, please contact the travel agency first for any change requests or requests, rather than directly to the hotel.
Depending on the festival, it is often decided that the majority of music festival participants will camp inside the venue, and most participants consider it to be an important part of the experience here.
If you want to experience it first-hand, you must arrive early and secure a campsite where the music can be easily heard.
Please remember that even after the music on the main stage is finished, there may be sections that continue to play music late into the night at the festival.
Some festivals also provide special campgrounds for families with young children.
When crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, please make sure to check the location of your cabin. The cabins that are most affected by the sound of pushing through the ice will be filled with terrifyingly loud noise.
The St. Petersburg cruise includes time for staying in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visas (please check the conditions).
In casinos, efforts are usually made to ensure that guests spend as much time and money as possible. Typically, there are no windows or clocks, and the exits can also be difficult to find.
Casinos typically offer special food and entertainment to ensure that guests stay in good spirits while on the premises.
Depending on the venue, alcoholic beverages may be provided. However, excellent gamblers understand the importance of staying sober because drunkenness dulls judgment.
People driving in high latitude areas or mountain passes need to consider the possibility of snow, ice, and below freezing temperatures.
Snowy and icy roads have less friction, so driving like on asphalt roads is not possible.
When it becomes a blizzard, enough snow accumulates in a short time to stop traffic.
Additionally, there are times when snow falls, blows, and the car window is covered with dew or ice, limiting visibility.
On the other hand, in many countries, it is common to have a lot of ice and snow, but transportation continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is probably the best tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight of many tourists' sightseeing.
A safari refers to a land journey for the purpose of observing wildlife, especially wild animals in the African savanna.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes tend to approach cars, so they can be clearly observed using standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are surprisingly timid, so it's necessary to use binoculars to see them well.
The Walking Safari (also known as "Bush Walk", "Hiking Safari", "Walking Tour") is a plan to walk around the safari zone for several hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games are scheduled to be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. There will also be events held in various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo is the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, since its inaugural event in 1964.
Those who had booked flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement announcement may find themselves in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies have not been extended until the scheduled Olympic Games in July 2020.
Event tickets are expected to range from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with regular tickets expected to be around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes makes them dry faster. In many hotels, they will lend you an iron and ironing board even if they are not provided in the room.
If you don't have an iron or want to dry things like socks without ironing, it's a good idea to try using a hairdryer if you have one.
Please be careful not to let the temperature of the dough rise too much (as it can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are various methods for water purification, and there are also advanced treatment methods that are effective against specific risks to the quality of drinking water.
Some areas boil in 1 minute, while in other areas it takes several minutes to boil.
The effects of filters vary, but if you are concerned, consider purchasing bottled water in sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travelers may encounter pest animals that are unfamiliar in their place of residence.
Pests can ruin food, bite the skin, cause allergic reactions in the worst case, scatter poison, and spread infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases and dangerous animals that kill or injure people by force are not usually considered harmful organisms.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase items that are exempt from consumption tax and commodity tax at specific locations.
Travelers visiting high-tax countries may be able to save a considerable amount of money, especially on items such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the least traveled section of the main highway connecting Buffalo and Pittsburgh, frequently passing through isolated undeveloped forest areas.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, please be careful of steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves, and do not let your guard down.
The posted speed limit is significantly lower compared to the surrounding sections, generally set at 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour), and it is considered more important to strictly adhere to this speed limit than in other sections.
However, strangely enough, the cell phone service is more reliable here compared to many other areas, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very delicious, and in the state of Bavaria, they are similar to the pastries of the southern neighboring country Austria, and there are also many varieties.
Fruit-filled pastries are common, with apples being used as a filling year-round and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods use nuts such as almonds and hazelnuts. Popular cakes especially go well with strong coffee.
If you want to try a small but rich pastry, depending on the region, try something called Berliner, Puffan Kuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish of meat and vegetables stewed in a base of herbs and spices.
Curry is classified as either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of water.
In the northern regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry, while in the southern regions of India and the coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is frequently used.
Indonesian cuisine, which can be chosen from the dishes of 17,000 islands, is a general term for a wide variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, if you use it without adding any further modifiers, it refers to the cuisine from the central to eastern parts of Java Island.
Javanese cuisine, widely spread across the archipelago, is known for its simple seasoning, with main ingredients such as peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various spices.
The stirrup is the part that hangs on both sides of the saddle and supports the rider's feet.
With this, the rider will be quite stable, but there may be concerns about safety because the rider's feet may get caught.
When thrown from a horse, there is a risk of getting caught in the stirrups at the moment, which can result in being dragged by the fleeing horse. To minimize this danger, several safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a narrow, smooth heel and sole.
Next, some saddles, especially those made in Britain, are equipped with a safety bar, so that if the rider is in danger of falling off and being pulled backwards, the stirrup leather will come off the saddle.
Kocha Mo Canyon - A climbing area in Chile known as the "Yosemite of South America", with many large granite walls and rock formations.
From the top, the breathtaking view stretches out. Climbers from around the world are surrounded by walls filled with endless possibilities, continuously establishing new routes.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports where people slide down snow-covered terrain wearing skis or snowboards on their feet.
Skiing is the main activity of the trip, and many enthusiasts called "ski maniacs" plan vacations centered around skiing in specific locations.
The concept of skiing is very old, and the image of skiers drawn in caves dates back to 5000 BC.
The history of the sport of downhill skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians established the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Skiing backpacking trip: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, and ski hiking.
It relates to alpine-style cross-country skiing and mountaineering, but usually it is not included, and the latter requires sturdy skis and boots for climbing steep terrain.
Think of the ski route as something like a hiking route.
If the conditions are good, it is rare to be able to travel at a speed like cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on a well-maintained course, even if it is a slightly longer distance than walking.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. In normal circumstances, traveling to multiple countries requires multiple visa applications and immigration checks.
However, the Schengen area operates as a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay within this area, you can usually cross the border without going through immigration checks multiple times.
By the same token, once you obtain a Schengen visa, there is no need to individually apply for visas for Schengen member countries, which can save a significant amount of time, money, and administrative hassle.
There is no universal definition for antiques. Some tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiques.
This definition includes geographical variations, and in regions such as North America, there may be a narrower range of age restrictions compared to Europe.
Handicrafts may have a shorter history than mass-produced counterparts, but they can also be defined as antiques.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding their trade is also important for many people in other professions.
However, the Sami people have traditionally not been involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but have engaged in activities such as fishing and hunting, so reindeer were mostly kept as working animals.
Nowadays, many Sami people are engaged in modern trade. Tourism is an important source of income for the Sami region.
The word "gypsy" is widely used among people other than the Roma, but it is often considered an unpleasant word due to its negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma people.
If the country you are planning to visit becomes the subject of a travel advisory, it may affect your travel health insurance and trip cancellation insurance.
I don't mind referring to advice from other governments, but such advice is intended for the people of that country.
As an example, Americans living in the Middle East may face different situations from Europeans or Arabs.
The advisory is just a summary of the security situation in a particular country.
The presented views are often superficial and oversimplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Adverse weather refers to a dangerous weather phenomenon that can lead to physical damage, serious social disruption, and harm to human life.
The severe weather can be seen anywhere in the world, and its type varies depending on geography, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and wildfires are caused by severe weather phenomena such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones and their effects.
There are regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena such as blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the potential risk of adverse weather conditions affecting their destination area, as it may have an impact on travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that may be considered a conflict zone must undergo specialized training.
If you search for "hostile environment training" on the internet, you will probably find the addresses of local companies.
The course generally covers in much greater detail all the issues being discussed here, and usually includes practical exercises.
Courses are typically 2-5 days long and may involve training in role-playing, first aid, and sometimes weapon use.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness are not uncommon, but there are very few publications dealing with conflict areas.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery overseas must ensure that they have valid identification documents to prove their identity upon returning home.
The government's intentions to issue passports with no gender specified (gender section marked "X") and to issue documents with updated names and genders based on the individual's preferences vary.
The will of foreign governments to recognize these documents is also extremely diverse.
Since September 11, 2001, security checkpoint inspections have become even more intrusive.
Transgender individuals before surgery will not be able to pass through the scanner while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Offshore currents refer to the pulling waves that break and return to the beach, and in many cases, they occur in rocky or similar areas.
Due to the seafloor topography, the return waves tend to concentrate in a few deep areas, potentially creating fast currents leading into the deep sea.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, but it is probably impossible to swim against the current.
Once you break free from the current, swimming back isn't that difficult.
Maybe it's better to aim for a place where you won't get caught in the waves again, or if you don't have confidence in your swimming ability, you might want to wait for rescue.
The re-entry shock may occur earlier than the culture shock (with less honeymoon period) and may persist, leading to worsening symptoms.
Travelers who have easily adapted to new cultures may struggle to adapt to the local culture.
Returning to your home country after living overseas means losing some of the customs of your native culture that you had adapted to the new culture.
If it's your first time traveling abroad, the people around you will probably be patient and try to understand, because they know that travelers need time to get used to it.
Travelers may not expect to require patience and understanding upon returning to their home country.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the special attractions that children can especially enjoy at this tourist destination.
You can visit the pyramid in silence before the start of the show, as the pyramid is visible in the darkness.
Usually, you can always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors here. The story woven by sound and light is like a picture book.
The Sphinx is not only the background of a long story, but also a storyteller.
Under the night sky, images are projected onto the pyramid, which lights up one after another.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by some countries and have the most number of bases, with 16 active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the village of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
There are also Livingston Island, Deception, and others, and grand natural harbors spread by water-filled calderas of still active volcanoes.
Ellsworth Land is located in the southern region of a peninsula surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The merging of the mountains on this peninsula formed a plateau, which then merged again to form the 360km long Ellsworth Mountains, divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the Northern Sentinel Range, there is the highest peak of the Antarctic continent, the Vinson Massif, with the towering Mount Vinson at an elevation of 4,892 meters.
In areas where mobile phone signals do not reach, satellite phones may become the only option.
Satellite phones are not essentially a replacement for mobile phones, because you need to be outdoors with a clear view of the sky to make a call.
This service is frequently used by ships such as pleasure boats, as well as exploration teams that require data and voice communication in remote areas.
The resident's telephone company should provide detailed information on how to connect to this service.
Among students planning a gap year, the option of traveling and learning is becoming increasingly popular.
Popular among graduates who are particularly unsure about their career path, this program allows students to take a one-year hiatus without damaging their academic record before entering university.
In many cases, entering an overseas gap year course makes it easier to actually advance to university after returning home.
Usually, there is a tuition fee to enroll in these education programs.
Finland is the perfect country for boating. Finland, known as the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," has thousands of lakes and coastal archipelagos with many thousands of islands.
In archipelagos and lakes, yachts are not always necessary.
The island chains along the coast and the largest lake are certainly of a size to enjoy yachting, but you can also have a different experience with small boats or kayaks.
In Finland, boating is a national pastime, with a ratio of 1 boat for every 7 to 8 people.
This is almost on par with Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it is very rare in other countries (e.g. 1-40 people in the Netherlands).
Most Baltic Sea cruises feature extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
In other words, it means that you can stay overnight on a boat and take 2-3 days to tour historical cities.
If you use only shore excursions for landing, you do not need to obtain a separate visa (as of 2009).
According to the guidebook, some cruises include Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is located away from the sea, so the city sightseeing is separate from the cruise fare.
Flying can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially for those who have never been on a plane or have had traumatic experiences in the past.
It is not shameful and no different from the personal fears and disgust that many people have.
Understanding the mechanism of airplanes and their behavior during flight can sometimes help overcome fear of the unknown and things that are out of our control.
The delivery company earns high rewards for rush deliveries. In many cases, it is important for business documents, products, or replacement parts needed for urgent repairs to arrive in a short time.
In some routes, large companies have their own aircraft, but there have been problems with other routes and small-scale companies.
When sending luggage by air cargo, it sometimes took several days to unload and clear customs depending on the route.
In order to pass quickly, we had no choice but to send it as checked baggage. According to the regulations of the airline, it is not possible to send luggage if there are no passengers, so what happens next is crucial.
To ride in first class or business class, it goes without saying that you will have to pay a high price according to the treatment (If it is a business trip, try negotiating with your company).
However, it is definitely not cheap. As a rough guide, the cost of business class is four times that of the regular economy class, and first class is eleven times.
Generally speaking, it doesn't make sense to look for discounts on business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines charge these fees because they know there is a central group of specific passengers who are willing to pay the highest amount for the privilege of being able to travel quickly and comfortably to their destination.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic country and has been plagued by ethnic conflicts.
As a result of this conflict, the Transnistria Republic in eastern Moldova was born in 1994, with its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failed political negotiations, economic ties are being reestablished between these two regions in Moldova.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir, facing the Aegean Sea, is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million. It has the second largest port after Istanbul and is also a transportation hub.
It used to be an ancient city of Smyrna, but now it has become a modern, bustling commercial center that is developed around a huge bay surrounded by mountains.
In the wide boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers, there are traditional red-tiled buildings, 18th-century markets, old mosques, churches, synagogues, and other scattered traditional Turkish buildings, giving the atmosphere more of a Mediterranean European feel than traditional Turkish.
From the village of Haldarsik, you can see the nearby Esturøy Island, and the village has a rare octagonal church.
In the church graveyard, some graves are decorated with interesting marble sculptures of doves.
Exploring a village that piques your interest for about 30 minutes is worth it.
In the northern part, there is a romantic and charming town of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners because Lord Byron passionately spoke about its beauty.
The bus 403 to Sintra runs regularly and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Let's visit the sanctuary (shrine) of the world-famous Marian image in Fatima, which is also known as a holy site for the Virgin Mary, if you go to the northern side.
Please do not forget that the place you are visiting is essentially a massive collective graveyard, possessing an unfathomable significance to the majority of the world's population.
There are many men and women here who survived that time, and there are a large number of people who had their loved ones killed or were forced to do hard labor, regardless of whether they were Jewish or not.
Please show respect and behave with dignity and etiquette befitting the occasion. Joking about the Holocaust or Nazis is completely inappropriate.
Let's refrain from defacing famous spots with paint or graffiti with sharp objects.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer Catalan, the majority understand Catalan, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, because Catalan is designated as the first official language by law, most signs are displayed only in Catalan.
That being said, Spanish is widely used in public transportation and other public services.
The regular announcements inside and outside the metro are only in Catalan, but in the event of delays due to accidents, announcements will be made in various languages such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese through the automatic system.
Parisians are said to be selfish, arrogant, and rude.
This may be an inaccurate stereotype, but the best way to get along in Paris is to behave well like "well-raised" people and take the best actions. By doing so, you will be able to live comfortably.
At first glance, Parisians may seem difficult to approach, but they will quickly change once they see the basic etiquette.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is a world heritage site overflowing with stunning views, with 16 lakes of various sizes scattered throughout a vast forest containing a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation (mainly beech, fir, and spruce).
The range of soil and elevation is extremely wide, due to the microclimate, so there is a very rich variety of plant communities.
In addition, a wide variety of animals and birds inhabit this area.
In Europe, rare species such as brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wildcats, and capercaillies can be found, along with a greater number of common species living together.
When visiting the monastery, it is mandatory for women to wear a skirt that covers the knees and also covers the shoulders.
Most monasteries provide coverings for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own especially bright colored one, you will receive a smile from the monks or nuns at the entrance.
Men are required to wear pants that cover their knees in the same way.
You can also borrow them at the reception at the entrance, but some may hesitate to wear them considering that they are not being washed for each user. It is a one-size-fits-all for men.
The cuisine of Mallorca, like other regions of the Mediterranean, primarily uses bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and makes heavy use of olive oil.
In particular during the summer, a simple dish called "pan boli" made by adding tomatoes, cheese, and tuna to bread spread with olive oil is popular.
All nouns, like the word "you" in Sie, always start with a capital letter even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It may be a little complicated for the writer because it is necessary to examine whether verbs and adjectives are used in their actualized forms, but it will definitely be easier for the reader.
The pronunciation of Italian is relatively easy, and most words are pronounced exactly as written.
The main characters to pay attention to are c and g, as pronunciation changes based on the following vowel.
In addition, while "caro" means "dear", "carro" means "tank", so it is important to pay attention to the distinction in pronunciation between "r" and "rr".
Persian is relatively easy to learn, and mostly follows regular grammar.
Therefore, by reading the introductory edition of this grammar book, it will become easier to learn a lot about Persian grammar and to understand expressions more easily.
It goes without saying that if you know any Romance language, learning Portuguese should be easy.
However, someone who knows a little Spanish might jump to the conclusion that "there is no need to study Portuguese separately because it is a very close language."
Astronomical observatories from before the early modern period are now mostly obsolete and have been abolished, remaining as museums or educational venues today.
The pollution that caused the most damage at the time was different in type from the current problems, as it occurred in urban areas and school playgrounds, making it more immediate than modern issues.
Many of the latest research telescopes are installed at remote, large facilities in order to observe under favorable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as "hanami," has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, which loves plum blossoms.
The first cherry blossom viewing event in Japan was organized by the emperor himself exclusively for the nobility living in and around the imperial court.
When plants are at their best in their natural environment, resist the temptation to bring back just one specimen.
If you try to collect "specimens" in a well-maintained garden you will be expelled without any excuse.
Singapore is generally known for its extremely good public safety, easy accessibility, and the ability to purchase almost anything upon arrival.
However, being located a few degrees north of the equator in the "high-latitude tropics", it is necessary to deal with both heat (constantly) and strong sunlight (on rare occasions, but during clear skies).
There are also several buses heading north to Hebron, the legendary burial place where the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are said to be buried in the Bible.
Please confirm that the bus you are trying to board is not only heading towards the Jewish settlement near Kiryat Arba, but also going to Hebron.
A walk along the inland waterways would be an interesting theme for spending a holiday.
For example, visiting the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, taking a cruise on the Danube River towards charming towns, and taking a boat ride on the Erie Canal would also be nice.
We have also set the routes for popular hiking and cycling courses.
Christmas is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus and one of the most important holidays in Christianity.
Various traditions surrounding holidays are accepted not only by non-Christian believers living in Christian countries, but also by non-Christians around the world.
On Easter night, there is a traditional custom of spending the night in a place with a good view in order to see the sunrise.
There is, of course, a theological explanation in Christianity for this tradition, but it may also be related to the spring and harvest rituals seen before the AD era.
Many traditional churches often hold Easter Vigil on the Saturday night of Easter weekend, and it is a custom for the faithful to start a celebration to rejoice in the resurrection of Christ at midnight.
The animals that came to the Galapagos Islands initially all either swam, flew, or drifted there.
Due to being isolated from the mainland, mammals could not journey there, and the tortoise became the main herbivorous animal in the Galapagos.
Since people set foot on the Galapagos, many mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs have been brought there.
In winter, you can experience the "polar night" where the sun does not rise above the horizon when visiting the Arctic or Antarctic.
Due to this phenomenon, the sky becomes dark for almost 24 hours, making it a good opportunity to see the aurora.
In this area, you can enjoy the starry sky because the population is sparse and there is hardly any light pollution.
Japanese sentence: The labor culture in Japan is more hierarchical and formal compared to what people from Western countries are used to.
Wearing a suit as standard work attire and addressing colleagues by their last name or job title is common.
Harmony in the workplace is very important, and for that, we emphasize the efforts of the group rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain the approval of their superiors for whatever they do, and are expected to unquestioningly follow their superiors' instructions.
