In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as the control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter and acknowledges the critical need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.

This not only confirms that there were at least some dinosaurs that had feathers, which is already a widely held theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's feathers are chestnut brown on top with a dull or carotoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, also known as the rhachis, but it had other feather features - shaft filaments and barbules - and the researchers inferred that the rhachis may have been a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The feather structure suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggest that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the feathers indicate adult features and not a chick's down.
The researchers suggested that even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the fossil shows adult feathers and not chick fluff.

The work that is being done is mostly theoretical, but the program is written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by gravitational forces between the Milky Way's dark matter and the dark matter of the galaxy.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the earth, causing the tides, so does the Milky Way also exert an attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that the dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most dark matter in a galaxy is found in a type of halo and consists of very small particles.

In France, voting was a traditionally low-technology experience: voters isolated themselves in a booth, and then put a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the candidate of their choice into an envelope.
After officials have confirmed the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter's roll.
French electoral legislation has quite strictly codified these procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there were no envelopes at the beginning of the election and that no envelopes were added except those that were counted and verified by registered voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. Votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision in the evenings, according to specific procedures.

Her other race, the Giant Slalom, saw her finish in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11:60 minutes slower than the first place athlete, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09:02 minutes slower than the ninth place athlete, Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's group failed to complete their runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to place in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phones.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police superintendent, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, said that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
Therefore, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision took place is temporarily closed while emergency services rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to the Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with murder of her son in the Edinburgh Sherrif Court.
She is in custody awaiting her charges and questioning, but any eyewitness evidence may be influenced because her image has been widely publicized.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish legal systems work differently and courts have seen the publication of the photos as potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "journalists cross a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects."
Crown Office, which is in overall control of prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made, at least until charges are filed.
The document will, according to the informant, refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle Eastern War.
Other topics covered in the reports include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow such presence for only five years.
Field rangers closely monitored shooters in the supplementary pest control trial, as the trial was being monitored and effectiveness evaluated.
Qualified volunteers have been recruited under the Sports Shooter Association's hunting program, in collaboration with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O’Flynn, the Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS, the four selected shooters for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new Provincial Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a measure package to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some owed since 2011.
Around 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
METI announced last week that Apple had informed them about 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "non-serious."
The minister's office responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly a shame."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 p.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands emergency management office has declared that no damage has been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Ocean Warning Center also said that there is no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been reported dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman as she needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza has been shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He studied to become a midwife and started working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins started researching premature births in his free time.
Her research showed that if hormones are administered, it will accelerate the fetus's lung development.
Xinhua reported that the state's investigation team recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
People wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager Luna passed away on the night of two moons. Very unique just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as strange as I am... maybe even more... loved her and will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place."
From the 1,400 previous voters of the 2010 federal election, those who are opposed to Australia becoming a republic have grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, claimed during the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled share this view, they want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's final monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of the respondents believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist had to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his injuries, his fitness was called into question.
He couldn't use the medicine he needed to overcome his pain because it is banned from the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware or software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may possibly be a source of water delivery to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the earth was formed, as comets collided with the earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill that legalized same-sex marriages.
He referred to the rumors as political gossip and folly.
People speculate that he will make a bid in the presidential election in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of liters of fuel annually, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to descend the aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation is available, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and drive-through facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears about a loss of transport have increased the possibility that the game will be played behind closed doors and without the team's supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday, mentioned the emergence of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the species adapted in just two generations, although this process was believed to take much longer, due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can also be rolled into small forms.
It can be pulled out into a thin wire, which can be twisted or braided. It can be beaten out or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhered to other metals. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen (the H in the pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ion is a proton from which the electrons have been removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Turn the two dry powders together and then press them into a ball with clean wet hands.
The bird on your hand will react with the outer layer, it will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, and it was attached to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of drainage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back, almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
It takes a giant missile over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope in outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has given us is much easier and faster transportation.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey such as rabbits and antelope.
Finally, there are many small kittens (including free-roaming pet cats) that eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, each cat has a special job that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups known as prides.
Lion troops consist of one to three related males, along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion troops often act like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are remarkably similar to lions (but not to other large cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, jump long distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The animal is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The animal's roar is not like the full-bodied roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of piercing shouted words.
Small wild cats love to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the wild cat hunts are smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that "hyenas" follow and locate prey by scent. They sniff the ground to find out where the animals were.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and also move unnoticed. Leopards hunt their prey by blending in with the environment and then pouncing on their victims.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is removed from the main population where they come from, (such as when they cross a mountain range or a river, or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily retreat), they will sometimes find themselves in a different environment than they were previously in.
The new environment has different resources and other competition, so the new population will require different characteristics or adjustments than they previously needed to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed much, they still require the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population began to adapt to their new environment, they started to look less and less like the other populations.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will differ so much that they cannot even be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in, and they take in carbon dioxide that people breathe out (i.e., exhale).
Plants make their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build our homes and to make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Her long jawbone has more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of her mouth, which means that there is no escape for anything that crosses her path.
We are not sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included shellfish, large fish, mosasaurs, and he may have been a cannibal himself.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would not stand a chance against it.
While much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own share of strange or unusual feasts that included wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of marsupial known as a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the women eat their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men preferred to hold banquets where they lie on their sides and eat their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included food that came to Europe from America, or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa and no Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the deity.
People would bring offerings to the gods and the priests would try to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and feasts.
Every temple had an open courtyard and then an inner chamber where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, as well as enough ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top side of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family happened in the open air.
Women cooked in the garden; shops are just open counters that overlooked the street. Stones were used to build the house.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan so wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In Norse sagas it is told that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it that.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes had already lived there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you may think that there is a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Nevertheless, it is not true. Even if there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The text appears upside down, at the bottom of the document.
While no one is sure who wrote it, it is known that early in his life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, it is possible that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that subsequently broke out freed the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was under the control of the "Vichy" French. They were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On the 15th of August 1940, the Allies invaded South France, the invasion was known as "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French forces liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significant large group of people who collaborate and live and work together as a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or like a city, and it also defines the size of the society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture passed on the transfer of knowledge over many generations, a continuing cultural footprint and fair distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The congress did not have the power to enforce taxes, and, because there was no national executor or court, they relied on the state authorities, who often did not want to cooperate, to carry out all their acts.
It also had no authority to override tax laws and rates between states.
The articles require unanimous consent from all states before they can be changed and states take the central government so lightly that their representatives were regularly absent.
Italy's national soccer team, together with the German national soccer team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup winners in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic meetings.
Japan consists of almost 7000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
There is often reference to Japan, from a geographical standpoint, as an "archipelago" due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has.
Taiwan began long ago in the 15th century where European navigators passed by to record the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624 the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, and implemented a transformation in indigenous grain production practices by hiring Chinese workers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing dynasty (1644 - 1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas in 1683 and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which they transfer sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which rules the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have already been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
This is still being produced today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) are equivalent to or closely estimated to this aspect ratio.
The frequently abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates movement while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the picture vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was placed under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian faith has bound European states together despite language and cultural differences.
The all-pervading power of it has affected everyone; from the king to the community members.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the financial resources of the church specifically exist for this reason.
For more than a thousand years, the central authority of the church has been in Rome, and this concentration of power and money has led to many questioning this premise.
Shortly after the outbreak of the unrest, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has been proven effective; it has cut off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated widely accepted international laws through various international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain has mined in international waters to prevent any ships from entering large parts of the ocean, which would pose a danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take up a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each stage of China or each family in control was a separate dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period that took place in the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was severe warfare between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in Ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to sit on the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to one ruler.
After the Revolution, professions were also open to male applicants who were the most ambitious and successful allowed to succeed.
The same goes for the military, as the military ranks are now based on caliber rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammad was deeply interested in events beyond this earthly life. He regularly visited a cave that became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has endured for a long time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world, and rests on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In truth, it is not easy to find, even if one knew it exists. When one is in a cave, it is a complete isolation.
Nothing else but the clean, beautiful air above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of this world can be heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures built to honor the death of the Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upward" mark looks like a V and the "downward" mark looks like a little hook or a square without its bottom side.
On means you should start at the point and push the bow, and off means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bow usually creates a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to write in your own points, but remember that the printed barlines are there for a musical reason, so they should normally be respected.
The fearful King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to flee back to Paris from Versailles on the 6th of October 1789, by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris while being surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening against the King and Queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, a member of the protesters swung the head of a royal who was killed at Versailles in front of the frightened Queen.
The war costs of U.S imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines have been paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They are forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to alleviate a large part of the expenses and the interest on bonds has been driven by the Wall Street banks in the name of the Filipino government.
Of course, the super profits derived from the extended exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic profits of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Temple servants, one must understand the context that led to the establishment of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological determinism or the technological necessity in a strict sense that human fate is driven by an underlying logic coupled with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
The majority of interruptions of technological provisions share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, produces "effects" on society that are indigenous, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one may say that the car necessarily led to the development of roads.
A widespread road network, however, is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Ownership of a large number of vehicles also leads to accidents on the road, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for the recovery of damaged bodies.
Romanticism has contained a large element of cultural determinism, taken from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the physical environment shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture emerged that were linked to that environment, and these things, which are in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
The celebrity of being an epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D and lasted until around 1100 A.D.
The status declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices whose value was higher than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
The costume was initially strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
Due to the slow communication channels, styles in the west can lag behind by 25 to 30 per year.
Closer to the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own style. One of the greatest developments of the time was due to the Crusades, as people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce just enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Existence farming is a simple, sometimes organic system that preserves seeds native to the ecosystem combined with crop rotation or other relatively easy techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers are involved in subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Individuals with similar feelings of neglect by community standards are brought together by subcultures, and allowed to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinctive because of the members' age, ethnic origin, status, location, and/or gender.
The characteristics that clearly define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture regularly indicate their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of styles, which includes fashion, manners, and informal language use.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is by focusing on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, unfavorable circumstances, or deliberate abuse while growing up.
Such children are labeled as "runaways" or wild. Some wild children are kept by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment can be attributed to parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical limitations.
Wild children may have experienced serious child abuse or trauma before they left or ran away.
It is claimed that others were raised by animals; some lived on their own in the wilderness.
When a feral child is completely raised by non-human animals, it exhibits behavior (within physical limits) that is almost entirely like that of the particular nurturing animal, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make it easier and more interesting to learn, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Steering is not a method of learning, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals who are starting to use a new learning method, such as a new computer program or the beginning of a new project.
Steers can be either virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a form of steering but so is the small cursor man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual simulations are in the software and are intended to question, expedite, and clarify procedures for students who would find the process difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and nurturing, but that is the reality.
We see the Foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic traits of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the usage and rewards approach.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
“When Eighmey and McCord (1998) investigated hearing reactions to websites, they identified "Personal involvement" and "continued relationships" as new motivational aspects."
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretations of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
It is especially noted that one can pick up when a person is lying by interpreting the micro-expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks indicated in his document, The President's Speech, how people who were unable to understand the speech due to brain damage, were still able to accurately gauge sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation process adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variation back and forth between the two pools of each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plants available there.
Failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest accessible plant sources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest unless it is cooked.
In contrast, animal products (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they provide high quality protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Everything taken into account, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their own "protein problem" in a way similar to the way some chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
The interruption of sleep is the process of purposefully waking up during your normal sleep period and then getting back to sleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself setting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses correlates with the amount of tension in a person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive life force is present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve relief. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of various gods, the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated, and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, led by the USSR and USA. With the end of the war and clashes of systems and culture that led to the countries that emerged.
Within two years after the end of the war, former allies had become current enemies and the Cold War began.
This was the last for the next 40 years and would really be fought, by standing troops, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman bridgehead.
However it may be, overnight these plans were put into action, when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and occupied the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after entering the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Agreement and international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the fleets was traditionally to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time interfering with your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic expedition of WWII. The Americans attempted to get manpower and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mainly used U-boats, is trying to stop the traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would very likely have been able to conquer Britain since it could conquer the rest of Europe.
Bokke were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats are commonly kept in herds that have roamed over the hills and other grazing areas, and have been looked after by goat herders, often children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known shepherds. These methods of care are still used today.
Waspore was built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagon tracks typically consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to do so at greater speeds and with heavier loads than it would take to do so on the almost rougher roads of the day.
Crossbars were installed fairly early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if there was an iron strip on top.
It has become common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first pure iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, people started walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not typically walk upright.
Two-footed specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus was already walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more friendly towards the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to combat future suffering to some extent.
It's just like the symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we're not only looking for a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and neutralize them.
It is clear enough that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and problems have become bigger due to over-population and the excessive lifestyle of humanity.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printing press of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon at the Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap swipes that still exist are known as the oldest copies of the document that still exist. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of themselves as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers - or bits, to use computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term "insek" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to the group of insects.
The term is derived from an ancient acquaintance with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both Assassin bugs and Bed-bugs are nidicolous, adapted to living in a nest or dwelling of their host.
Across the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the largest neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research finds that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to set up an adoption plan for their baby.
With an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parenthood so that another couple may adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
Although it is not the only, experimentation, and an experiment in a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and take observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, are accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found themselves cut off from their Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology and behavior is often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycles, even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They have conducted two experiments that either labeled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the proteins of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ-line cells.
Only mutations in germ line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the purpose of enjoying the environment, including the plant and animal life.
Examples of activities on the premises include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit Borneo and learn about orangutans and photograph them.
Every morning people leave the small towns in cars to go to their workplaces and are passed by others whose workplace is the area they have just moved away from.
In this dynamic pendulum, everyone is connected in one way or another and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
The science shows that this massive carbon economy has disrupted the stable conditions of the biosphere that have supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems breed such complaints, why does it fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental at play?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Drivers fortunately operate within a reasonably consistent range, and thus traffic flows with a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships are established between the 3 main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of road level facilities.
Insects were the first animals to have flown. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily avoid their enemies and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage that they are able to fold their wings back onto their body.
It offers them a wider variety of small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold back their wings are the dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system orbits around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believe the opposite; that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times six miles wide.
'20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into oceans comes from the Amazon.'
The main river of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid-building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
New Kingdom ancient Egyptians were amazed by their predecessors' monuments, which were already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the daily language used by many who work in states where Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, and these can all be found in nature in their basic form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he has a theory that they can change into new forms that we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered as metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There may also be alloys that contain small amounts of non-metal elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit in that point at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was a good friend to many when it came out.
Unfortunately, the status and use of the pencil decreased as newer writing methods were used.
People now write messages on computer screens and do not need to go near a sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something totally unexpected occurs.
The nuclear bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
It's almost like pushing a heavy wagon up a hill. The splitting of a nucleus releases that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that they break apart with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the oceans and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more magma on the near side as the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around what motivates or pleases people.
These theories assume that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
These theories examine what it is about certain people that causes them to want the things they do and to do the good in their environment that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two types of behavior can emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, to carry out disciplinary actions, to evaluate employee performance, to delegate responsibilities, and to hold employees accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels like they need to change everything the team was working on and make it their own.
The leader is after all responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior sometimes causes a break between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members regularly function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They regularly have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams gather in different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a visual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards there for each member.
Why would an organization go through such a time-consuming process to establish a learning organization? One purpose of establishing organizational learning concepts in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across functional departments of an organization, creativity and resourcefulness can thrive.
As a result, the organization works together to overcome the obstacle and this can lead to a new process of innovation to serve the client's needs.
Leadership must create a culture of creation, as well as shared knowledge and organized study before an organization can be innovative.
Angel (2006) explained the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows down the research areas and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, fractures, and tumors affect behavior and, in some cases, alter certain mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes like never before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models to help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Al has a strong connotation with science fiction, Al forms a very important branch of computer science, which has to do with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include management, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer client diagnoses and queries as well as handwriting recognition, voice and facial.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now regularly used in the fields of economy, medicine, engineering, and military units, and is also integrated into various home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of any classroom. A teacher often wants to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
To share a virtual trip is also a good way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year design students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state's capital, the website is redesigned every year, but old versions are kept online and serve as a scrapbook.
Web journals can also help to improve students' writing abilities. While students often start their web journal experience with messy language and spelling, the presence of observers usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the web journalist strives to improve writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging "compels students to become more skilled about the world around them. The need to feed the interest of the audience inspires students to be clever and interesting" (Toto, 2004).
Blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to take learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings, as well as to express their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and contains a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls and the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and the surrounding area.
All these things and more characterize Ontario as what a true Canadian may be viewed as by outsiders.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more Afro-Americans living in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent on its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, and it strongly took hold in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as the explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female travelers say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (as long as it is not one that looks expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences may cause them to feel harassed, and that it is not uncommon to be pursued, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when leading men, and don't be afraid to stand up for your rights (Cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!)
The modern city of Casablanca was established by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, just to abandon it again after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the less interesting shops to do shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as Moroccan cooking pots, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the village's streets, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside of Goma should be researched to understand the ongoing state of conflict in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with the cheapest mountain gorilla tracks in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to explore Goma. The normal (local) price is ~ 500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for exotic, far-off lands.
Today Timbuktu is a impoverished village, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, because of the dangers of the desert sands.
This was one of the main stopping points during Henry Louis Gates's special PBS program, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast with the rest of the country's cities, as it has more of an Arabic flair than that of an African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the north-eastern part of South Africa and follows the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different eco zones, each supporting different wildlife.
This is one of the main attractions of South Africa and it is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a "Wild Card" that grants access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the area of Hong Kong its name and it is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a dazzling column chart accentuated by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best theatre of Hong Kong, leave the island and travel to the Kowloon waterfront across the way.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's rural development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shoreline.
This is the place that the British colonizers took for themselves and so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world and extends 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest that falls within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just halophytic marshes - they include some of the last remaining stands of mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3 850 km², of which about one-third is covered in water/marsh areas.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and departing for Jakar/Bumthang between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are regularly full, it is suggested that one buys a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese Coaster Buses, which are reliable and sturdy.
Shared rental cars are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as, for example, Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters and are 378 meters long and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was closed for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational according to schedule in September of 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are anticipated to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most remarkable indigenous group who inhabited the area now known as Eastern Paraguay, and they inhabited the area as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering food, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as "The Great Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the skirmishes between Spanish conquerors and the local indigenous groups.
The Spaniards started the colonization period which lasted for three centuries.
Since the creation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, look to the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official Falkland currency is the Falkland pound (FKP) whose value is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley across from the FIC West shop.
British pounds will be widely accepted everywhere on the islands, and inside Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also regularly accepted.
In the remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, even though British and United States currencies will be accepted; ask the owners in advance to establish what the accepted method of payment would be.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; in the summer months temperatures above +30°C are common.
The winter can be deceivingly cool: temperatures barely go below freezing point, but the wind and humidity together make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the nature is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from lions, wolves, and 25 meters away from all other wild animals.
It doesn't matter how docile they may appear, buffalo, impala, American bison, bears and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year thousands of visitors are injured because they did not keep a proper distance. These animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships have sunk, except for one British warship. Nearly 200 American and German lives are lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the village caused the death of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the fact that Auckland stretches over two harbours. The most popular ones are in three areas.
North Coast beaches (in North Harbour district) are against the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming spots, and most have shaded areas provided by the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Rylaan beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good range of shops at the edge of the beach. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines available, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better transported.
The local tap water is quite safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
For Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A short black is 'espresso', cappuccino is served with whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is equal to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many expeditions are undertaken to the coral reefs throughout the year, and injuries on the coral reef due to any of these causes are rare.
Take advice from authorities, obey all notifications and pay attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear close to beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside of these times.
Sharks exist, but very rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't really live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may find it impossible to book other types of accommodation, such as campgrounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also handle the reservations for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or inquiries must, however, go through the travel agent and not directly through the hotel.
For some music festivals, the majority of attendees decide to camp on the grounds, and most see it as an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will have to come early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that although the music at the main stages may come to an end, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
When the Northern Baltic region is crossed in winter, make sure of the hut's location, as it causes a lot of noise, for those who are most affected, to go through the ice.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (confirm terms).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the amount of money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits may be difficult to find.
To keep to their starting point as well as to keep guests in a good mood, they usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks. However, drunkenness affects your judgment, and all good gamblers realize the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving over mountain passes at high latitudes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures below freezing.
The grip on icy and snowy roads is very low, and you can't drive as if you're on a bare tarmac road.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall quickly in a short time to trap you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or wind-blown snow or by condensation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris might be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The popular term safari, commonly used, refers to an overland journey to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially in savannas.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to vehicles and standard equipment will allow for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bushwalk", "hike safari", or "trekking") consists of a walk ranging from a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be hosted in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, after hosting the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to June 2020 when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
By ironing damp clothes, they dry faster. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to borrow, even if there isn't one in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful that the material does not get too hot, (otherwise it may shrink or, in extreme cases, scorch).
There are many different ways to purify water, some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, in others a few minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider purchasing your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests with which they are not familiar in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people with violence, usually do not qualify as plagues.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods free of taxes and duties at certain places.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxes can sometimes save a significant amount, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often venturing into remote inland terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, keep your distance: steep grades, narrow lanes, and sharp curves dominate.
Speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.

Beuels are for supporting the rider's feet hanging on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability for the rider, but can pose safety risks due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a horse throws off the rider and his foot gets stuck in the stirrup, he can be dragged along if the horse runs away. To reduce the risk, there are several safety measures that can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Next, some stables, especially English stables, have safety staff that allow a stirrup strap to come off the stable if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.

Ski is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski bums" who plan entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings dating back as far as 5,000 B.C. depict skiers!
The sport of downhill skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski tours: This activity can also be referred to as domestic skiing, ski touring or ski trekking.
It is related to that, but does not include alpine ski trips or mountain climbing, the latter of which is done on steep terrain and requires stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski route as similar to a hiking route.
In good conditions, you will cover slightly greater distances than walking - but only very rarely will you reach the speed of through-country skiing without a heavy backpack in neat tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would have meant going through visa applications and passport control points multiple times.
The Schengen zone, nevertheless works somewhat like one country in this regard.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control checkpoints again.
By having a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for each of the Schengen member states separately, thus saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for what manufactured items are antiques or not. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.

Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Time is very important when it comes to business documents, merchandise or replacement parts for urgent repairs.
The larger companies had their own planes on some routes, but for the other routes and smaller companies it was a problem.
If they send these goods by air freight, the unloading and customs clearance on some routes can take days.
The only way to get through this faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, so that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or better yet – get your company to do it for you).
Therefore, it is not cheap: as a rough rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal rate for economy and eleven times for first class!
Generally, there is no point in even looking for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airline companies know well that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of quickly and conveniently reaching a destination, and their account reflects accordingly.
