This fact not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (this theory is already widely spread), but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as information about color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed central shaft called rachis, but have other features - barbs and barbules - researchers concluded that the rachis likely evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for regulating temperature or display. Scientists believe that even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not those of a juvenile.
Scientists believe that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, it represents a sample of the adult animal's feathers rather than the downy feathers of a youngster.

Their thermal variations are not as stable as in the case of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but this is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the astrogeological team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff.
In France, voting takes place traditionally without modern technologies: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper into an envelope, stating the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter will insert the envelope into the ballot box and sign the voter list.
The French electoral law contains a fairly strict codification of the election process.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that there were no envelopes in them before the start of the voting and that no other envelopes were added than those inserted by counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives, who then witness the entire process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

In her next race, the giant slalom, she finished in the women's group in tenth place with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers in the sit-skiing group did not finish their runs and 45 out of the total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to place in the race.
The police in Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen notebook and mobile phone.
Deputy police director D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped a woman from Switzerland, and we have seized a mobile phone and a laptop belonging to the victim from the detainees."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused arrived at the court with covered faces.
Despite the fact that three people were in the house at the time of the car crash, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, suffered a serious head injury.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services rescued the driver of the red Audi TT.
At first, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was then charged with the murder of her son by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is waiting in custody for charges and a trial, but the witnesses' evidence may be compromised because her photo was widely published.
This is common practice anywhere else in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have perceived the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are apparently walking on thin ice if they publish photos of suspects, etc."
The prosecution, responsible for criminal prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further information will be provided at least until the indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document will relate to border disputes in which Palestine wants to maintain the borders as they were before the war in the Middle East in 1967.
The other included topics apparently include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the treaty, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to a military presence for five years.
The shooters were under strict supervision of rangers during the study of pest control supplements, as the study was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Qualified volunteers were hired under the supervision of the hunting program of the association through the cooperation of NPSW and NSW Inc (Australian Shooting Sports Association).
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director in the area of conservation of natural heritage at NPWS agency, the four shooters selected for the first shoot received comprehensive security training and coaching.
Martelly took the oath yesterday in the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission presented Martelly's reaction to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by election failures and some have been ongoing since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating faulty iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 incidents related to the equipment.
Last week, the CTIA announced that Apple informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company labeled as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable".
An earthquake struck in Marianas at 7:19 local time (Friday 20:19 GMT).
The Office of Civil Defense of the Northern Mariana Islands reported that no damages were reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
The former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at this point at least six deaths have been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were soon released and so were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later replaced the older lady because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in the field of medicine.
He was trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While Liggins was working at the hospital, he started to focus on premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that if a hormone is administered, it accelerates the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
The Sin-chua agency stated that government investigators discovered two "black boxes" with records of the flight on Wednesday.
Colleagues wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager. Luna passed away during a night when there were two Moons in the sky. Unique, just like herself. She was a strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels stated, "Luna was as crazy as I am... maybe even more... I loved her and will miss her... hopefully she's somewhere better."
The public opinion survey conducted with 1,400 people before the federal elections in 2010 showed that the number of people who disagree with the transformation of Australia into a republic increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
During the campaign in the 2010 federal elections, the leader of the caretaker government Julia Gillard declared that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of survey participants share this opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
As for extreme views within the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The golden Olympic medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle at the Commonwealth Games, as well as in three relays, but due to his complaints, doubts were raised about his eligibility.
He could not take the medication needed to overcome the pain, as drugs are prohibited at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
The discovery was verified by several people using various hardware and software at the beginning of February, with the announcement being made on Tuesday.
Comets can be a source of water delivery to Earth along with organic matter, which can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how Earth formed from the time when comets collided with Earth long ago.
53-year-old Cuomo began his term as governor at the beginning of the year and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He labeled these rumors as "political gossip and recklessness".
There are speculations that he will run for the presidential candidacy in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes and thus save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
In comparison with ground-based radar technology, satellite technology allows air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater accuracy and provides pilots with more precise information.
There will be no special transport introduced, above-ground train transport will not be installed in Wembley, there are no parking spaces or park-and-ride facilities available at the site.
Fears of a lack of transportation options have increased the chances that the match will have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
The study published on Thursday in the journal Science describes the origin of new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have stated that new species have evolved in just two generations, even though it was assumed that this process takes much longer, due to interbreeding between endemic Darwin's finches, medium ground finches, cactus finches and large ground finches.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. It is possible to roll it into tiny pieces.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be bent and woven. It can be stretched or pressed into sheets.
It can be processed to a considerable thinness and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was often used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH value of the chemical. You can create your own indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color based on whether chemicals are acidic or alkaline.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together and then form a ball from them with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, resulting in a strange feeling and forming a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of drainage systems were found in Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also present in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In ancient Rome, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, which were visited by men and women together.
If you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you are using a satellite for the conversation.
The satellite in space receives a call and then reflects its signal almost instantly back down.
The satellite was launched into space using a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts the light and field of view for us.
To launch a satellite or a telescope into space, a large rocket measuring over 100 feet is needed.
The wheel changed the world in an unprecedented way. The most significant thing it caused was a significant facilitation and acceleration of transportation.
He brought us train, car, and other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized feline predators, whose food consists of medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are a lot of small cats (including feral domestic cats), whose main diet consists of small prey such as insects, rodents, reptiles, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the system of ecological niches, meaning that each cat has its own tasks that do not allow it to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats, they live in large groups called prides.
A pack is formed by one to three related adult males together with up to thirty females and their offspring.
Females are usually closely related and form a large family consisting of sisters and daughters.
The lion pride behaves similarly to a wolf or dog pack, surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is able to climb (although not well), swim, leap long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the roar of a lion at the top of its lungs, but rather like a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they have the opportunity, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate prey animals by scent, using their sense of smell to detect the direction in which the animals moved across the ground.
At night, ocelots can see very well thanks to their night vision and are able to move very quietly. Ocelots hunt by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originates (for example, when they cross a mountain ridge or river, or move to a new island from which it is not easy to return), they often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptation methods to become a stronger competitor than in the past.
The original population did not change at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, in several thousand or even million years, these two populations will be so different that they will no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and take in carbon dioxide, which people exhale.
Plants produce food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We produce our homes and clothing from plants. Most of the food we eat is of plant origin. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it had no fear of anything except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were covered with more than 70 teeth as sharp as razor blades and an extra set embedded in the upper palate, which means that nothing crossing his path stood a chance of escaping.
We don't know for sure, but they may have had a split tongue. Their diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and they may have been cannibals.
They also attacked anything that entered the water. Even a large dinosaur like T. rex was no match for them.
While most of their meals would not be unfamiliar to us, the Romans had their share of peculiar or unusual banquet compositions, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that women and poor people ate their food sitting on chairs, while wealthy men liked to hold banquets together and lay on their side while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia until later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be their home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to accommodate the needs of the gods through rituals and ceremonies.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary designed for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place under the open sky.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops had only open counters facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no extensive forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. In Norse sagas, it is written that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it the Green Land.
Despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all the countries were part of "Scandinavia," there were many differences among the inhabitants, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Even though there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text is on the bottom of the document, written upside down.
Although the author is not known for certain, it is clear that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ x 24½ inches) was rolled shortly after its creation and stored.
It is therefore likely that the record was simply added as an appendix.
The landing in Normandy and subsequent battles brought the liberation of northern France, but the southern part of the country had not been liberated yet.
The French "Vichy" regime ruled over him. These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invading forces instead of fighting.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched an invasion of southern France. The invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a certain culture, common to a significant large group of people who live and work in mutual cooperation, thus forming a society together.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", which means "civil", and is related to the Latin "civis", which means "citizen", and also "civitas", which means city or city-state, and at the same time it defines the size of society in a certain way.
The predecessors of nations were city-states. The culture of civilization is characterized by the transmission of knowledge over several generations, the presence of long-lasting cultural traces, and adequate dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the war for independence, thirteen states first formed a weak central government, with Congress being its only component, falling under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial body, it relied on state authorities to enforce laws, which often did not cooperate.
It also had no authority to cancel tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be supplemented. The states regarded the central government lightly to the extent that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, and in 2006 Italy won the FIFA World Cup.
Some favorite sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, inline hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic contests.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands and the largest of them is Honshu, so Japan is actually the 7th largest island in the world!
With respect to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is sometimes referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing nearby recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan and thereby initiated the transformation of traditional grain production practices, employing Chinese workers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) took over control of the southwest and north coasts of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, under which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan. Japan ruled this island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is formed by three main terraces: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex were renovated to give tourists a better idea of how the buildings originally looked.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format of photography in the world is 35mm, which was the most common film size at the peak of the analog film era.
They are still being produced, but more importantly, their aspect ratio has also been adopted by digital camera sensor formats.
Although somewhat confusing, the 35mm format actually has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio in whole numbers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) are equal to or closely approximate this aspect ratio.
The often misused and ridiculed "rule of thirds" is simply a guideline that creates dynamics in an image while maintaining a certain order.
According to this specification, the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which gained wealth and power, became the subject of detailed scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christian religion has united European states despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power had an influence on everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the financial resources of the church are here precisely for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than 1,000 years. This concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of the conflict, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective because it disrupted vital military and civilian supply lines, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements from the previous two centuries.
Britain patrolled international waters to prevent any ships from entering certain areas of the ocean, posing a danger to neutral ships as well.
Since this tactic only met with limited reaction, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine military forces.
During the 1920s, pacifism and isolationist attitudes prevailed among the majority of citizens and nations.
As witnesses of horror and cruelty during the First World War, nations longed to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his superior at his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different periods of time; each era of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there were also unstable periods with divided provinces. The most famous of these was the Period of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this time, a relentless war was taking place between many noblemen fighting for the throne.
The era of the three kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of ancient China, when thousands of people died in the struggle for the throne in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, or the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to one ruler.
After the revolution, professions were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military, as instead of military ranks based on class affiliation, it now depends on abilities.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed workers from other countries to try to start a revolution in their own countries.
Mohamed was deeply interested in matters outside of worldly life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on a mountain called "Noor" (light) and contemplated there.
The cave itself, which has survived for a considerable time, provides a very vivid picture of Mohamed's spiritual focus.
Due to its position at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find it at all, even if it is known to exist. Inside the cave, it is in complete isolation.
There is nothing visible but a beautifully clear sky and a large number of surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, only very little of this world can be seen and heard.
The Great Pyramid in Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created as a tribute to the pharaoh Khufu, and plenty of smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The "loop up" symbol looks like the letter V and the "loop down" symbol looks like a clip or a square missing its bottom side.
At the top means that you start at the tip and press with the bow, at the bottom means that you start at the frog (where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Movement upwards typically produces a gentler sound, while movement downwards is stronger and more piercing.
You can write your own markings on the sheet with a pencil, but keep in mind that printed markings have their reason from a musical perspective, so they should usually be followed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and the king's sister Elisabeth Philippine were forced by a mob of market women to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage that was surrounded by a riotous crowd and shouted threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one moment in Versailles, a member of the criminal organization waved to the royal guard in front of the horrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States in order to cover a large part of the expenses, while the interest on the bonds flowed in the name of the Filipino government through Wall Street banking houses.
Surplus values extracted from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos would of course represent the basic income of American imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages, and the Late Middle Ages followed, which according to the majority of opinions ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice includes a wide range of ideas: for example, the so-called technology push or technological imperative, or the belief that human destiny is governed by an all-pervading logic along with scientific laws and their expressions in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology follows a path that significantly exceeds cultural or political influence, and that technology, on the other hand, has an "influence" on societies that is inherent rather than socially conditioned societies.
We can say, for example, that the appearance of motor vehicles necessarily leads to the development of roads.
The national road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to an increase in road accidents, prompting the development of new techniques in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism carried a significant element of cultural determinism drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geographically shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and because they were in line with the place of society, they were better than arbitrarily enforced laws.
Paris is known as the center of the fashion of the contemporary world, Constantinople was known as the center of fashion of feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began around the year 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
Its significance decreased during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that participants of the Crusades brought back valuables to Europe, such as silk and spices, which had a higher value at home than what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time, the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At the beginning, the clothes were significantly influenced by Byzantine culture.
Due to slow communication, however, Western styles lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advancements of this time was that as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is the agriculture performed to produce only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple, often organic system using locally adapted seed in a given eco-region combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Throughout history, the majority of farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture, which is still happening in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be different in terms of age, ethnic origin, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often express their membership through the prominent and symbolic use of style, which includes clothing, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw from several unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during their upbringing due to neglect, unfortunate accidents, or intentional abuse.
Such children are called "wolf" children. Some wolf children were imprisoned for a long time (usually by their own parents), in some cases they lived abandoned because their parents rejected them because of their severe mental or physical disability.
Wild children could experience serious abuse or trauma, after which they were abandoned or fled.
Among the others, it is claimed that they were raised by animals, while some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
During complete upbringing by non-human animals, a wild child exhibits behavior almost identical to that of the caring animal, such as its fear or indifference towards humans (within physical capabilities).
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method takes it a step further.
The skeleton is not a teaching method, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals undergoing the acquisition of new practice, such as using a new computer program or launching a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a certain form of scaffolding, but also a small clip in Microsoft Office.
In the software, Virtual constructions are incorporated for analyzing, motivating, and explaining procedures that could be too challenging for the student themselves.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide range of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse to extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where they lack proper nutrition, care, and upbringing, but such cases do exist.
We believe that the foster care system will be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is to ensure all the needs that were not met in the household from which they were previously taken away.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristic of the internet adds another dimension when it comes to usage and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important motivating factors for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "sustained interest" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important discoveries in interpreting microexpressions - facial movements lasting only a few microseconds.
Specifically, thanks to the correct interpretation of microexpressions, you can find out if the other person is lying to you.
Oliver Sacks suggested in his article "The President's Speech" how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess honesty.
It even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research from the 20th century showed that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle differences between both sets in both directions within each generation.
It is difficult for primates with a digestive system similar to humans to satisfy their need for amino acids from plant sources available in the open savanna.
If not, it has serious consequences: increase in depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant sources of protein would be available in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for us, as primates, to digest unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a high amount of proteins, which contain all essential amino acids.
Overall, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors dealt with the problem of proteins similarly to how chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally waking up from normal sleep and falling asleep again after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm from bed, you can place it on the opposite side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed in order to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking a large amount of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before sleep, as it forces a person to get up and go to the bathroom.
The level of inner peace in a person corresponds to the opposite of the level of tension in their body and spirit.
The smaller the tension, the more life force brings good. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment can be achieved by anyone. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded to include the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are basically very simple. They are kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened by the positions of this yoga, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central focus of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. Clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to the breakdown of cooperation between the countries at the end of the war.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the cold war began.
It lasted for another 40 years and there was indeed fighting by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been breached, and the only hope was retreat and reorganization of forces along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army formed Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the soldiers invaded the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transportation is by far the most effective way to transport large numbers of people and cargo across the ocean.
The traditional task of the navy was to ensure the state's ability to transport people and goods, but at the same time the navy was also supposed to prevent the enemy from transporting their own people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy attempted to stop this operation, mainly using submarines.
If the Allies had not been successful, then Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain, similarly to the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate animals for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were mostly kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures and were often guarded by shepherds, sometimes including children or adolescents, similar to more well-known sheep herders. These methods of herding are still used today.
Horse-drawn railways were already being built in England in the 16th century.
Although stagecoach routes usually consisted only of parallel planks, they allowed draft horses to reach greater speeds and carry heavier loads than on other roads of the time, which were somewhat rougher.
The sleepers were introduced relatively early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually found that the tracks are more efficient when they have an iron strip on their surface.
This became a common occurrence, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wagon wheels.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known method of transportation was walking, with people beginning to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessor Australopithecus typically did not walk upright.
Bipedalism is present in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs already seven million years ago.
To some extent reduce future suffering, we can live more responsibly towards the environment, join the environmental protection movement, and even become activists.
In many cases, it is similar to symptomatic treatment. However, if we are not only looking for a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problems and get rid of them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and problems have grown as a result of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After being approved by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
Overnight, something between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are currently known as "Dunlap prints".
The document was publicly read for the first time by John Nixon on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his soldiers in New York on July 9th. One of the copies reached London on August 10th.
The oldest known surviving copies of the document are the so-called Dunlap broadsides, a total of 25 prints from Dunlap's printing press. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are still plenty of signs on birds that remind us of dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all of today's computers are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
The binary number can have only one of two values, that is 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or in computer jargon, bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to determine an immediate diagnosis.
The presence of an open container of medication or household products containing toxic chemicals can be the best indicator of poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions in case of the specific poison.
The term "beetle" is used by entomologists for this group of insects in a formal sense.
This term is derived from ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing on humans.
Both bedbugs and fleas are cunning, adapted to life in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis, making it the leading neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS than men.
A couple can decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These parents can decide to go through with the adoption plan for their child.
In the case of adoption, biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method is actually the guiding principle of most scientific research.
It is not just about experimentation itself. An experiment is a test used to refute one or more possible hypotheses, but for scientific research, asking questions and observation are also important.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on classical texts, especially the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all areas of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend significantly on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented in most living organisms including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to run freely through a cycle even in the absence of external cues.
Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They carried out two experiments, in which they either labeled DNA with radioactive phosphorus or protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the cells of the germ line have been affected.
Only mutations in the germ line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations occurring elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism oriented towards nature attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of admiring the landscape, including the wilderness and animals.
Examples of activities in this type of tourism: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the relevant ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small towns in their cars, go to work, and meanwhile they pass others who are heading to work to the place from which they themselves just left.
On this dynamic shuttle transportation, everyone contributes and supports a transport system based on private vehicles.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has derailed the biosphere from its stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely come across a similar level of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transportation systems evoke so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something deeper going on?
The traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Studying traffic flow is unfortunately difficult because it is impossible to predict drivers' behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave similarly within a certain range; therefore, traffic usually has a certain reasonable consistency and can be approximately mathematically represented.
For the purpose of better representation of traffic flow, relationships between three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, designing, and operation of transportation facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly allowed them to more easily evade enemies and more effectively find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage that they can fold their wings back along their bodies.
It provides them with a wider range of small spaces where they can hide from predators.
In today's world, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
A man named Aristarchus said thousands of years ago that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), moves around the Earth.
That sounds reasonable, because people don't feel that the Earth is moving, do they?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching up to six miles wide in some places.
Twenty percent of the water flowing from the rivers of our planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It gathers water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite the construction of stone pyramids continuing until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in size or technical precision of construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old at the time.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legal regulations and official communications.
Italian is also a daily language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are of the Roman Catholic faith.
People have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as these elements are found in nature in their pure form and can be relatively easily mined even using simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These elements were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that it transforms into new substances forming what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are a lot of elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are classified as metals. However, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
The pencil was unfortunately pushed to a lower position and secondary use with the emergence of new ways of writing.
People today write messages on computer screens, so they never come into contact with a pencil sharpener at all.
One can only marvel at what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
Nuclear fission bomb operates on the principle that energy is needed to hold together the nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like pulling a heavy cart uphill. With the splitting of the atomic nucleus, a portion of this energy is then released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or even no contact.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and around 100 km on the far side.
Under the sea it is weaker and under the mountains it is stronger.
On the near side, there may be more lunar seas, because the crust is thinner there. Lava could more easily reach the surface.
Content theories are focused on determining what can appeal to people or what is close to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they adopt during adolescence.
These theories focus on what motivates certain people to want to do what they do and what in their environment induces them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can arise when managers start leading their former colleagues - peers. At one end of the spectrum is the effort to remain "one of them" (or one of them).
This type of manager has difficulty in making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and leading people to accountability.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person changes beyond recognition and feels the need to change everything their team does and do it according to themselves.
The leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team often serve as the contact points for their own physical group.
Often they have more independence than regular team members, because their teams may meet across different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The unique component of a virtual team is also the presence of the so-called "invisible team" (Larson - LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
"Invisible team" is the management team to which every member is subordinate. The invisible team sets standards for individual members.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals for implementing the concepts of a learning organization is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively utilized across the functional components of the organization, creativity and innovation can be demonstrated.
The result is that the process of collaborating organizations to overcome obstacles can lead to new innovative processes to serve customer needs.
In order for an organization to be innovative, its leadership must create an innovative corporate culture, introduce knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the approach of Continuum as a method that organizations use to achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence to the theoretical approach to studying cognition. This research area thus narrows and specifies it.
Scientists in their research are supported by the mutual connection between brain disease and behavior.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe and examine brain structures and processes not yet seen by anyone.
This gives us a lot of information and material for creating simulation models that will help us understand processes in our mind.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong connotation with science fiction, it forms a very important area of computer science dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligence adaptation of machines.
Research in artificial intelligence involves creating machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include checking, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and inquiries, handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, and is embedded in a number of home computer applications and video game software.
Excursions are an essential part of every subject. The teacher would often like to take her students to places where going by bus is not an option.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual excursions. Students can look at artifacts from the museum, visit the aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Virtual sharing of excursions is also a great way to think about the trip and share experiences with future classes.
Students from Bennet School in North Carolina, for example, create a website about their trip to the state capital every year. Every year they revamp the pages, but the old versions remain online and serve as an album.
Blogs can improve the written expression of students. Although their blogging is often marked by careless spelling in the beginning, the influence of other readers usually changes that.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to have an overview of the world around them". The need to stimulate audience interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and stimulates students to expand their education beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "allows students to improve their analytical and critical abilities; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their positions in the context of other texts and formulate their views on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital city of Canada offering a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further to the south lies the Niagara Falls, and to the north, the beauty of the Muskoka region and others are still waiting to be discovered.
All this and much more emphasizes that Ontario is considered by foreigners as a typical part of Canada.
Large areas further to the north are relatively sparsely populated and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Many people are surprised by the following population figure: in the USA, there are more African Americans than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of wildlife, can be considered a separate continent.
The majority of smaller islands are independent states or are attached to France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to these countries. It thrived in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route (Cape Route) from Europe to India.
In the north, the area is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers should be listed as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also good to wear a ring (just be careful not to look too expensive).
Women should keep in mind that due to cultural differences, they may encounter harassment and it is not uncommon for a man to watch a woman while walking, grab her hand, etc.
Be uncompromising in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences don't justify it!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was utilized by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, and after the earthquake in 1755 they abandoned it.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city into Daru l-Badya and Spanish merchants, who established their trading bases there, gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes, and a wide range of brushes, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, situated on the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside the city should be well thought out considering the current state of the fighting that continues to take place in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano and offers one of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa.
For the journey around Goma, you can use boda boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual price for a short ride is roughly 500 Congolese francs.
In combination with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" began to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Timbuktu is now a poor city, but due to its reputation, it is a tourist attraction. It also has its own airport.
In 1990, due to desert sand, the World Cultural Heritage List was added to the list of endangered places.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS television show African World Divas, hosted by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is in sharp contrast to the rest of the cities in the country, as it appears more Arabic than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wilderness.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Similar to all National Parks in South Africa, here you have to pay an entrance fee and a contribution to nature conservation.
The purchase of the Wild Card can also be beneficial, as it allows entry either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The city of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, which many tourists consider a major travel destination.
The parade of buildings that make up the city skyline of Hong Kong is likened to a glittering column graph reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best views of Hong Kong can be obtained by leaving the island and heading to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of dense urban development on the Hong Kong island is located on the reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that has been claimed by British colonists, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial history of the territory, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest strip of coastal mangroves in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A part of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining stretches of powerful jungles that once covered the plains of the Ganges.
The Sundarbans area covers an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one third is covered by water or wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a natural reserve and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 Indian axis deer in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) all day, but most of them, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Taking into account that intercity buses are often full, we recommend buying a ticket several days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese coastal buses that are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.5 meters in width.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but the operation was not started until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully functional in September 2017, when the completion of Brazilian customs checkpoints is expected.
The Guarani tribe was the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area that we now know as eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who made a living through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally called the "Great Province of the Indies," emerged as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquistadors with groups of indigenous inhabitants.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also to be seen here in other times of the year.
If you are interested in tournaments and where to get tickets for polo matches, check out the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands and in the city of Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, but you might succeed with British and American currency. Don't forget to ask the owners in advance about the payment method you can use.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so make the exchange before leaving them.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer is there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common here.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but with the wind and air humidity, it feels colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific periods of "rain" and "drought" here: the amount of precipitation remains fairly constant throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are accustomed to people, they are still wild animals living freely in the wilderness, and therefore should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park rules, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
Despite looking peaceful, bison, deer, moose, bear, and almost all large animals are capable of attacking.
Every year, many visitors are injured due to not maintaining the proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Bear in mind also that bears and other animals in the wild are attracted to smells, so avoid bringing or cooking aromatic foods and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 50s of the 18th century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of the notorious maritime standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except for one British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans perished.
During the effort for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of the highest chief named Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches here, considering that Auckland is situated between two harbors. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost sandy beaches with safe swimming and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located near the Waitemata Harbour in the sought-after neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
They are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide selection of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", which is not a particularly complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that you can have, but New Zealand and Australian wines could be a better choice.
The tap water here is safe, but if you're concerned, bottled water is readily available.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign. "Espresso" is a small black coffee, cappuccino is full of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but first-rate.
Throughout the year, many trips are taken to the reef and injuries caused by any of these causes are rare.
And so, follow the authorities' advice, obey the signs, and pay careful attention to safety warnings.
Quadrilateral nets are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of Seventeen Seventy. Occasionally they can also be found outside of this time.
Sharks really do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
The saltwater crocodile does not actively live in the ocean, its primary habitat is the mouth of the river north of Rockhampton.
Reserving accommodation in advance gives the traveler the certainty that they will have a place to spend the night at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it is possible to also book other forms of accommodation such as campsites through them.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation, or even combined packages of flight and hotel.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think it over or to arrange for additional documents for the destination (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests should be directed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel address.
In the case of some festivals, the majority of visitors choose to camp directly on site and most participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be in the center of the action, you will have to arrive as soon as possible to secure a spot for camping located close to the music production.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage may have ended, in other sections of the festival the music may continue until late into the night.
Some festivals include special camps for families with young children.
If you take a trip across the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as sailing through ice causes unbearable noise in exposed areas.
The St. Petersburg circular cruises include time in the city. Visa requirements do not apply to passengers on circular cruises (check the conditions).
Casinos usually try to make guests spend as much time as possible in them and spend as much money as possible. They often lack windows and clocks, making it difficult to find the way out.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offers to keep visitors in a good mood and in the casino premises.
Some facilities offer alcoholic beverages on the company's account. However, intoxication negatively affects the ability to make judgments, so all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high geographical altitude or in a mountain pass should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the traction is low and you cannot drive as you would on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow falls in a very short time to make driving impossible for you.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or swirling snow or dew or ice on vehicle windows.
Ice and snow, on the other hand, are normal in many countries and traffic continues without major interruptions throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and for many tourists, it is the highlight of the whole trip.
The term safari in the popular sense refers to ground travel for the purpose of viewing the stunning African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, and standard equipment will provide a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you can observe them better with the help of binoculars.
The tourist safari consists of a hiking tour lasting several hours to several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24th August to 5th September 2021. Some events will be held at various locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it was already the host in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for the year 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, this situation may be difficult for you.
The principles of event cancellation may vary, but as of late March, most event cancellation policies based on the coronavirus did not apply to the July 2020 scheduled Olympic Games.
It is expected that tickets for most events will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 Japanese yen, with regular tickets costing 7,000 Japanese yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, even if it is not directly in the room.
If an iron is not available or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinking or in extreme cases, burning).
There are plenty of ways to purify water, some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others it may be necessary to boil it for several minutes.
Filters have varying effectiveness and if you have concerns, you should buy water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Difficult insects can cause food spoilage, skin irritation or, in worse cases, allergic reactions, spread of toxins or transmission of infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can cause harm or kill a human being generally do not fall into the category of pests.
Shopping duty-free represents an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and other fees in certain areas.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxation can sometimes save significant amounts, especially when purchasing products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco products.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont on the highway from Buffalo to Pittsburgh offers the most challenging driving conditions, as it often passes through isolated wooded terrain.

Stirrups, which hang on both sides of the saddle, serve as a support for the rider's feet.
Riders provide greater stability, but can be associated with safety issues due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup and the horse starts running, the rider can be dragged along. Various safety measures can be implemented to minimize this risk.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a fine tread, which is relatively narrow.
Some saddles, especially English ones, have safety stirrups which allow the stirrup leather to come out of the saddle when a falling rider pulls on them.

Downhill skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century. The first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Ski touring: This activity is also referred to as cross-country skiing, skiing or ski trips.
It has to do with alpine skiing or mountaineering, although they are not part of this activity, with the second of these activities being performed in steep terrain and requiring much sturdier skis and boots.
Imagine the ski trail as a similar to a hiking trail.
Under favorable conditions, you can cover slightly larger distances than on foot - but you will rarely move at the speed you would achieve on skis without a heavy backpack and in a groomed track.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with a number of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean going through visa and passport control multiple times.
The Schengen area, however, in this respect operates similarly to one country.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can generally cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa in each Schengen country separately, which will save you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what items are considered antiques. Some tax agencies define goods as antiques if they are more than 100 years old.

Backward currents represent returning waves that break on the beach, often at a rocky place, etc.
Due to the underwater topography, the reverse current is concentrated in several deeper sections, and it is here that a fast current into deep water can be created.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion from attempting to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for somewhere where the current won't drag you again, or depending on your abilities and whether you have been noticed, it's better to wait for help.
The shock of the return occurs earlier than the culture shock (there is a smaller phase of initial excitement), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture often have a particularly challenging experience when readjusting to their native culture.
After returning from a stay abroad, you are used to the new culture and have already lost some of the habits from your home.

In remote areas without mobile signal coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
The satellite phone is not generally a replacement for a mobile phone, because in order to make calls, you must be outdoors without obstacles between you and the satellite.

Parcel companies are well paid for the fast delivery of goods. Time is often a very important factor in commercial documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies have their own airplanes, but there is a problem with other routes and smaller companies.
If the items were sent by air freight, then on some routes it could take several days for the items to go through unloading and customs control.
The only way to handle this faster is to send the item as checked baggage. However, aviation regulations do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most common way to fly in first or business class is to fork over a thick wad of cash (even better is to get your company to do it for you).
