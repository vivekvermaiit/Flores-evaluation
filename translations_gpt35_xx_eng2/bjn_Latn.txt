The environment that is constantly changing is the source of balance and harmony, so the population must be preserved in its natural state or adapted to become a stronger balance than it was before.
The initial population has not changed at all, so it still requires adjustments like before.
During the old days, the population only began to adapt to its environment, and they started to pay less attention and care to other populations.

Wild animals like this can experience abuse in the West or trauma before being captured or made into pets.

In the savanna, primates search for food in a system similar to human primates in order to fulfill their need for plant amino acids.
What's more, the inability to work results in various issues: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
Plant sources that provide protein are found in leaves and legumes, but these must be cooked before being consumed by primates.
On the other hand, animal foods (fish, insects, and meat) are not always available, but they also provide a large amount of protein containing essential amino acids.
When our hearts are calm, we don't need to be surprised when our ancestors face "natural problems" the same as what chimpanzees do in today's savanna.
