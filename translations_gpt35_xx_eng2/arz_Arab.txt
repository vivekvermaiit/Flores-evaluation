The matter is not confirmed, but at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a well-known factual theory, but it also provides details that fossils cannot generally provide, such as color and a three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists say that the animal's feathers were built with chestnut color on top and the side underneath is pale or carotenoid colored.
Discovery enables us to have a deep insight into the topic of feather growth in birds.
Because the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a long big chain called the vertebral column, but there are other characteristics in these feathers, such as the protrusions and spines, but researchers found that the vertebral column was mostly something that happened as a result of the evolution that occurred later for these other characteristics.
The structure of the wings indicates that they were not used for flying but rather for regulating temperature or display. Researchers say that even though these dinosaurs were small, the sample shows that the feathers were large, not small.

All I will say to people is to treat us the way we treat you.
Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed a bill to prohibit the sale or rental of video games containing violent scenes to minors, and he also signed it.
The proposed law imposes placing a label with "18" written on it on violent video games sold in California, and imposes a fine of 1000 dollars for each offense on those who sell it to minors.
The Director of Public Prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, said in a statement this morning that Huhne and Pryce will stand trial.
He resigned and will be replaced in the cabinet by parliament member Ed Davy. It is expected that parliament member Norman Lamb will take over the position of Minister of Business that Davy will leave.

Among the casualties were Nicholas Alden, who was twenty-five years old, and Zakari Kodibak, who was twenty-one years old, and Kodibak was working as a driver.
Edgar Viguila was injured in his arm and jaw, but Christopher Schneider needed reconstructive facial surgery.
Schneider suffers from constant pain, blindness in one of the eyes, and loss of part of the skull and face reconstructed from titanium, all of this happened at a time when a gun was aimed towards the head of a fifth man.
Schneider testified through a video link from a US air force base in his country.
Carbanido entered two individual races in the championship because of the issue we saw on Wednesday.
The first race I participated in was the slalom skiing race, but I didn't finish the race from the first round. I ranked 36 out of 116 competitors who competed for the same result in this race.
In the second race, which is the giant slalom skiing race, she took the tenth place in the women's sitting group after completing the race in 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch who took the first place, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the Hungarian Jang Ji Dani who took the ninth place.
In the women's race, four competitors did not finish the race, and 45 out of 117 competitors did not score points in the giant slalom race.
The police in Madhya Pradesh returned the stolen computer and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Aria said, "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the suspects are Baba Kangar, Butha Kangar, Rambo Kangar, Ghaza Kangar, and Vishnu Kangar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the suspects stood in front of the court and covered their faces.
Even though there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them got hurt.
The driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed until the emergency services freed the driver from a red Audi TT car.
In the beginning, Khalis entered the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
And then he went to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adikeya has been accused of killing her son in a court in Sheriff Edinburgh.
She is detained as a precaution and waiting for the charges to be directed towards her and for her trial, but any evidence from a witness can be forged because of the widespread publication of her picture.
This is a practice popular in other places in the UK but Scottish justice operates differently and the courts considered that the publication of the photos may be biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee said, "It seems to me that journalists are heading in a dangerous direction if they publish photos or something similar related to suspects."
The responsible office of the crown in general for trials, stated to the journalists that it will not comment further than this, at least until the charges are filed.
According to the leaked document, it refers to the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants based on the borders before the war that happened in the Middle East in 1967.
The other topics that are said to have been covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is an important issue for both peoples, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is requesting the continuation of military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years, which is the first expected agreement, but the Palestinian Authority is agreeing that this presence will only continue for five years.
The guards had to closely monitor the participants in the supplementary pest control experiment, and the experiment was being conducted and evaluated for its effectiveness.
In a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were selected for the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Deputy Director of Park Protection and Heritage at NPWS, the four hunters chosen for the first hunting operation received intensive training on safety guidelines and hunting.
Martelly took the oath yesterday as a member of a new interim electoral council with nine members.
This is the fifth interim electoral council of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee called for the resignation of the interim electoral council as part of a series of measures to organize new elections in the country.
The committee was Martelly's response to the large protests against the regime and it started in October.
The violent protests have appeared at times due to the failure to conduct the elections that were supposed to be held since 2011.
I submitted a report about approximately 60 defects and the overheating of an iPod device, which resulted in approximately six fires and four people sustaining minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said it was aware of the 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, "Mete" company announced that Apple reported 34 other incidents that caused an increase in temperature and described by the company as "not serious."
The ministry responded to Apple's request to delay the report saying "it's really unfortunate."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 in the morning local time (Friday 09:19 pm Greenwich Mean Time).
The Emergency Management Office in the Northern Mariana Islands said that there are no damages in the country.
One of the people working at the tsunami warning center in the Pacific Ocean said that there are no indications that a tsunami wave could occur.
The police officer who used to work for the government dared to kidnap tourists from Hong Kong as hostages after he went and kidnapped their bus in the city of Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired shots from his M16 rifle at the terrorists.
Many hostages were rescued and at least six have died so far.
Six hostages were released early, including children and elderly people, as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an old lady because she needed to go to the bathroom, and then they shot at Mendoza.
Leggings became his father's job and medicine became his profession.
I trained to become an obstetrician and worked at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Leggings started to investigate premature birth in his spare time, when he was working at the hospital.
His research showed that taking the hormone can make the fetus's lung grow quickly.
ShinKhoua said that government investigators recovered flight recorders or what is known as the black box on Wednesday.
The colleagues praised Luna's performance.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first extreme queen. My first boss, Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. A strong woman, unmatched."
"Dustyn 'Goldes' Reynolds said: "Luna was strange like me... and she might be more than me... I love her and I miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
From among 1,400 people who were surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the percentage of those opposing Australia becoming a republic increased to eight percent in 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed agreed with this viewpoint, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
In the latest survey results, 29% saw that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31% saw that Australia should not become a republic at all.
The fitness of the athlete who won the Olympic gold medal in swimming is now being doubted because of his complaints, as he was scheduled to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle in three stages at the Commonwealth Games.
He can't take the medicine he needs to overcome his pain because it's prohibited in sports.
Curtis Cooper, who works in the field of mathematics and is a computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, succeeded in discovering the largest known prime number up to now on January 25th.
A few people verified the discovery and used different devices and programs at the beginning of February, and they announced it on Tuesday.
The deltas are considered a source for conveying water to the land, in addition to the organic matter that can form proteins and make life possible.
Scientists are hopeful to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed from the impact of comets on the Earth a long time ago.
Como, who is 53 years old, began his rule at the beginning of this year and signed the bill last month allowing same-sex marriage.
He said that these rumors are "meaningless and silly political things".
He is expected to nominate himself for the presidency in 2016.
The next generation is a system called NextGen that the Federal Aviation Administration claims will allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
She uses a method that connects satellites to it, unlike the old method which used ground radar to help air traffic controllers accurately determine the location of planes and provide pilots with very specific information.
There will be no additional transportation, and local public transport trains will not stop at Wembley, and there will be no car parking facilities or facilities for gardens or facilities for getting around the stadium.
The fear of transportation shortages has led to the possibility that the match will be played behind closed doors with no audience.
There was a study published on Thursday in the journal Science saying that a new type of bird has appeared in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden said that the evolution of new species continued for two generations, but they believed that this process would take a very long time due to interbreeding among the resident Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch, the migrant cactus finch, and the one-beaked ground finch.
Gold can be manufactured in any possible shape. And it can be damaged into small shapes.
You can drag it in a thin wire, wrap it and untangle it, and also you can tap or fold it into sheets.
We can make it very thin and stick it to another metal. And it can be so thin that it was used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "Illuminated Manuscripts".
This is called the acidity level of the chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substance.
The pH level is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical substance they want to test.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Slightly squeeze the dry powder holders and press them with a clean moist hand so that they remain in a ball shape.
The moisture on your hand will react with the outer layers, giving you a strange sensation and forming a kind of covering.
My city Haraba and Mohenjo-Daro had a toilet with a drainage system in almost every house connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the homes of the Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were at certain times part of the public baths because men and women used them together in a mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and visibility.
The matter requires a giant rocket over 100 feet tall in order to launch an artificial satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an unbelievable way, but providing an easier and faster mode of transportation is the most important thing it has contributed to us.
We imported the Qatar and Arabian, and many other types of transportation.
Among them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to gazelles and deer.
At the end of the topic, there are kittens (including stray domestic kittens) that eat small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds, which are more numerous.
The reason for his success was the concept of prestige, a special function that prevented each cat from competing with the others.
Black cats are the most social and live in large groups called colonies.
The lion family has one to three adult males, and also has thirty females and cubs.
Normally, the females are close to each other because they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lionesses behave like packs of wolves or dogs, and they closely resemble lions in their behavior (but not other large cats), and they are also very deadly to their prey.
He is a exceptional athlete, the tiger can climb (even if not good) and can also swim and leap long distances and can also pull with a force five times that of a human.
The tiger remains in the same group (the tiger species) with lions, leopards, and jaguars. The four of them are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full sound of a lion, but it is closer to being like the yelling with angry words.
Dwarf leopard loves to eat small animals, it hunts monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if it knows how to do so. Almost all the animals hunted by the dwarf leopard are smaller in size.
Scientists believe that African wildcats track and locate animals to prey on using their sense of smell, and also smell out their locations on the ground.
You can see well in the darkness through night vision, and they also move stealthily. Also, dwarf leopard hunts its prey by blending in with its surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main group they are part of (for example, when they migrate across a mountain range or river, or when they move to a new island where they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than the one before.
Due to the presence of different resources and competitors in the new environment, this newly established group will need different attributes or adaptation methods in order to remain a stronger competitor compared to the strength it required before.
The original inhabitants have never undergone any change; they still need the same adaptation methods as we have known about them.
Over time, as new residents begin to adapt to their new environment, their similarity to the other residents gradually decreases.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will be different to the extent that we will not consider them the same type.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is considered a necessary result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis and also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants, and we make clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The Tyrannosaurus rex was the dominant predator in its era, which is why it feared nothing except for other Tyrannosaurus rex.
The long jaws of the crocodile were anchored in for over 70 million years, like blades and another set on the roof of its mouth, meaning that there is no escape for anything that stands in its way.
I'm not sure, but he might have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, and other dinosaurs, so he might have been a meat eater.
I also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex didn't stand in front of it.
While most of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans have their share of unusual or unorthodox holiday elements, such as wild boars, peacocks, crocodiles, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
There was also something different, which is that the needy and the women, while they were eating their food while sitting on chairs, the rich people liked to set up tables and eat together, so they would lean on their side while eating their meals.
The ancient Roman meals could not have included the food that came to Europe from America or Asia in the centuries that followed.
For example, they didn't have any apples, tomatoes, potatoes, or even cocoa, and the ancient Romans didn't eat turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of the gods and considered it the house of the god.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to fulfill the needs of the gods during celebrations and festivals.
In every temple there is an open courtyard, inside which the priests are the only ones allowed.
At times, they used to build distinctive pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats to be part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a safe place for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house doesn't have any importance.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
The women used to cook in the courtyard; the shops were just open storefronts facing the street. Stone was used in building the homes.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, that's why wood was expensive.
Humans settled Greenland in separate groups. In Scandinavian sagas, it is told that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland on a charge of murder, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
Without taking into account its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were living in these areas.
Despite all these countries being "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the national treasure movie, you might feel that the treasure map was written on the back of the declaration of independence.
But this is not true. Even though there is something written on the back of the paper, it's not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence is written on its back with the phrase "The original Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document and is upside down.
Although the author of this part of the text is not known, we know that the large manuscript (measuring 29¾ inches × 24½ inches) was stored folded at the beginning of its existence.
That's why the symbol may have been added to simply name it.
The landing operations that took place on the historic day and the subsequent battles led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was not liberated yet.
The French people were under the rule of the "Vichy" government. They were the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On the 16th of August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France, and they were on their way to Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture in which a large group of people live and work together, meaning a society.
The origin of the word civilization is the Latin word "civilis", which means civil, related to the Latin "civis" meaning citizen, and "civitas" meaning city or state. This also defines the social structure in a specific way.
The country/city is the first step in building nations. The cultural civilization in its content is the transfer of knowledge from generation to generation and a cultural imprint that persists and distributes fairly.
Small cultures often end without any real historical evidence and are not recognized as real civilizations.
During the Independence War, the Thirteen Colonies formed a weak central government initially, with only the Congress as its component with federal system provisions.
The Congress did not have any authority to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial authority, they relied on the state authorities, which were mostly uncooperative, to enforce all their laws.
She didn't even have the authority to override the tax laws and customs duties between the states.
The materials required approval from all the governors before being amended, and the states mocked the central government to the extent that their representatives were mostly absent.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are the second most successful teams in the world, and they were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the group/system of islands in Japan, they used to refer to Japan geographically as an "archipelago".
Taiwan began its return journey in the sixteenth century, when European sailors who passed by it wrote the name of the island as Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company built a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to change the practices of original grain production and employ Chinese workers to work in rice and sugar farms.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War between 1894 and 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
The city of Machu Picchu has three main buildings, which are Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings located on the edges of the complex were re-constructed to give visitors a better idea of how they originally appeared.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was renovated and restoration work is still ongoing until today.
For example, the most commonly used format for capturing still images in the world is 35mm, which is the most widespread film format at the end of the analog film era.
The production is still ongoing until today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio of the image sensors in digital cameras has inherited the ratio of width to height.
The 35mm model is actually a bit confusing, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio in this image would be (or you can divide by 12 to get the ratio to the simplest integer) so it will be 3:2.
It is very close to or equal to many of the common formats (such as the advanced image system formats), the aspect ratio of width to height.
The trinitarian principle they use in a bad way and often make fun of, forms a simple guiding principle that creates dynamism while maintaining a certain level of order in a clear manner.
The most influential place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
The Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, was under investigation by the authorities during this period of European history.
The Christian religion has linked European countries with each other for more than a thousand years, despite being different in language and customs.
The comprehensive strength that I possessed had an impact on everyone from the king to the general public.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that cash funds in the church are specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has made many people wonder if this doctrine meets the requirements.
Britain hurried to encircle Germany by sea after skirmishes and confrontations appeared.
The strategy has proven its effectiveness; vital military and civilian supplies are interrupted, despite the blockade violating the generally accepted international law, which has been written and coordinated in some international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has planted mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering certain areas of the oceans, which threatens even neutral ships.
Because there is limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the twenties of the last century, peace and isolation were the attitudes that most citizens and nations preferred.
After we saw the hardships brought about by the First World War, the country wanted to avoid it happening again.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to work with Edison's company in New York City.
He went to America with 4 cents and a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way and it's amazing how they refer to specific periods in history; they refer to all periods of China or all dynasties that were in power as a different type.
There was a period of instability with the division of the territories among the families. The most famous of these periods was the era of the three kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During that time, there was a fierce war between many nobles who wanted to reach the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest periods in the ancient history of China, where thousands of people died during the fighting for the control of the highest seats in the great palace in Xian.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolute monarchy to republic, nationalism, and the realization that the state belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
After the revolution, jobs were a consolation for young men, and it was an opportunity for those who had bigger dreams to fulfill them.
The same thing was in the army because instead of the army rankings being based on class, now it depends on the weapons.
The French Revolution also had an impact on many of the oppressed working class in other countries, as they began their own revolutions.
The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, was very concerned with the needs that go beyond this worldly life. He used to go to a cave called Hira on top of Mount Nur to meditate.
The cave that the Prophet entered and which still exists in every era presents itself as a very vivid portrayal of the spiritual inclinations of the Prophet Muhammad.
The cave is located on the top of a mountain north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy at all to find him even if you know he's there. As soon as he enters the cave, he is in complete isolation.
There's nothing you can see except the beautiful clear sky above the many surrounding mountains. And you can only see or hear very few of the internal things inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid in Giza Governorate is the only one still remaining of the Seven Wonders of the World until now.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Pharaohs in the third century BC, is a large pyramid structure built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" located in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, contains some pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many other pyramids, tombs, and smaller temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The "up bow" sign looks like the letter V and the "down bow" sign looks like a staple or a square with the bottom side missing.
The top mark indicates that we should start from the top and push the bow, while the lower mark means we must start from the end of the bow (where your hand holds the bow) and pull it.
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and a little more intense.
Don't hesitate to draw your marks with a pencil, but remember that the curved printed marks are there for a musical reason, so they must be observed.
Scared, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their young children (Marie Therese, who is 11 years old, and Louis Charles, who is 4 years old), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris by a group of market women rioters on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage and were surrounded by a lot of people who were shouting and chanting against the king and queen.
A group of the crowd succeeded in forcing the king and queen to open their car windows at the end.
One of the gang members at a certain time roasts the head of one of the royal guards who were killed in Versailles in front of the scared queen.
The Filipino people themselves are the ones who paid the price for the American imperial war in their invasion of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial system in order to bear a large portion of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Naturally, the significant profits coming from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people will constitute the primary gains of American imperialism.
We need to understand the context that drives the establishment of the organization, in order to fully grasp the Temple Knights.
The era in which all the events took place was the High Middle Ages, which is a period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The high middle ages were preceded by the early middle ages, and followed by the late middle ages, which all ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses the practical implementation of a wide range of ideas, ranging from technological dynamism or technological necessity to the strict viewpoint that human destiny is determined by a fundamental logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path far removed from cultural or political influence, and that this technology in turn has an "impact" on the culture of the rooted and socially unconditioned society.
For example, one could say that the car engine leads to the development of bridges.
Establishing a network of roads throughout the country is not economically beneficial for a few cars only, which is why they are developing new roads to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Collective car ownership also leads to an increase in the accident rate on the roads, resulting in the development of new medical techniques for treating bodies that have been damaged.
Romance was based on a significant element of cultural determinism drawn from the works of Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
With the flow of romantic movement, geography used to define individuals, and over time there were customs and culture related to this geography, and those, in order to be in harmony with the place of the society, were better than the laws that were imposed forcibly.
Paris is famous for being the fashion capital of the world now, but Constantinople was the fashion capital of Europe during the feudal period.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began in 400 AD and continued until 1100 AD.
The situation weakened during the 12th century mainly because the Crusades brought back gifts such as silk and spices, which had a higher value than what the Byzantine markets offered.
In this time, Paris has become the fashion capital instead of Constantinople.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th or 11th centuries to the 14th century.
At the beginning, the fashion was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
Despite that, and due to the slow channels of communication, the situation in the West may be delayed by about 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments during that time was due to the Crusades, when people started using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is the type of farming whose aim is to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family only.
The cultivation of subsistence – which is usually organic – is a simple system in which seeds from the local store that are compatible with the ecological system of the area are used, in addition to crop rotation or other simple techniques in order to enhance the results.
Most farmers used to work in agriculture for subsistence before, and this situation continues in many developing countries.
Subcultures work to bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop their own identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that determine the distinction of a subculture are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, ethnic, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures express their membership through their use of symbolic styles in clothing, behavior, and vocabulary, which is distinctive.
Among the common methods used to highlight the significant role played by social upbringing, is their reliance on the few unfortunate cases of children who have suffered from neglect, bad luck, or deliberate harm, without being socially connected by adults, as they grow up.
The children are being called "feral" or wild. Some stray children have been detained by people (often their parents) In some cases, they have abandoned the child due to the parents' rejection of the severe mental or physical disability.
The wild children may have been subjected to bad treatment during childhood or severe traumas before being abandoned or running away.
There are doubts about whether other animals raised them; and some say that some lived in the wild alone.
When raised by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits (within physical limits) behaviors very similar to those of special care animals, such as fear of humans or lack of concern for them.
In a time when project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, but the support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning is not a way of learning, but rather a supportive means to assist individuals who are experiencing a new educational experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual or in-person, and in another way the teacher is considered a form of interactive learning, and also a man who is proficient in Microsoft Office.
Internal learning in the program is internally supported, with the goal of posing questions, motivating, and explaining procedures that may be difficult for the student to handle alone.
The children are placed in the care of the state because they face needs like neglect, harm, and even exploitation.
It's not at all suitable for any child to grow up in an environment that lacks upbringing, care, and education, but that's what happens.
We know that the alternative care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Alternative care must provide all the necessary needs that they lost in the homes they previously left.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and personal interaction.
The specific features of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the concept of "uses and benefits".
For example, some people argue that education and socialization are essential drivers for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
The personal engagement and ongoing relationships were identified as new motivational aspects through the study conducted by Eimi and McCord (1998) when they analyzed the audience's reaction to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting facial expressions, which are facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
It is particularly claimed that one can discover if a person is lying through interpreting the subtle expressions correctly.
Oliver Sachs wrote in his paper that the president's speech states that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are able to assess sincerity with great credibility.
He is suggesting that these abilities in analyzing human behavior are shared with some animals like pet dogs.
The studies of the twentieth century revealed the existence of two groups of genetic variations: one hidden and the other apparent.
The mutation adds a new genetic diversity, but the selection removes it from the pool of expressive differences.
The separation and reassembly operations create random variations between the two groups with each generation.
In the savannah, the main mammals with a digestive system similar to that of humans find it difficult to meet their requirements of essential amino acids from available plant resources.
You fail when you do this, it will lead to serious consequences like stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The plant resources that were easily accessible are the proteins that can be obtained from leaves and legumes, but these proteins are difficult for primates like us to digest if not cooked.
On the other hand, animal-based food (ants, white ants, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides a large amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
When we consider all these things in our minds, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors tackled the "protein problem" they had in a way similar to how chimpanzees do in the savanna.
Interrupted sleep is when you wake up deliberately during your sleep after a short period (from 10 to 60 minutes) after falling asleep.
It's possible to do this easily using a relatively gentle alarm to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up from your sleep.
If you find yourself adjusting the clock again during your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which forces you to get out of bed to stop it.
Options based on circadian rhythm include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known diuretic) before bed, which forces one to wake up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the stress, the more the positivity that gives life its strength. And every person has the hidden ability to enjoy constant peace and contentment.
Every person can reach what they want. But the only thing that stops us on our way to the goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism relies on the teachings of Buddha, but has spread through the Mahayana path of love and other methods taken from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
The Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) awakens through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chants, and visualizations, with Kundalini yoga.
The Tibetan Meditation Center is the Yoga God. Through visualizing the various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras activated, and consciousness created for enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and America. However, when the war ended, the differences in systems, procedures, and cultures caused the conflict between the two countries to reappear.
After two years since the end of the war, the allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
This war was supposed to continue for the next forty years, with fighting taking place on the ground, through proxy armies coming from Africa and Asia, present on the battlefield in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On the seventeenth of September, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Roman Bridge.
However, despite that, these plans became outdated in no time. When more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international bilateral treaties involving many parties.
The use of ships for transporting goods is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of the navy was traditionally seen as ensuring your country's ability to transport your people and goods, while at the same time, disrupting your enemy's ability to transport their people and goods.
One of the modern examples that should be noted is the North Atlantic campaign in the Second World War. The Americans tried to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
The German navy was trying to prevent the occupation using submarines at that time.
If the allies had failed, Germany would most likely have been able to defeat Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes used it to easily access milk, hair, meat, and skins.
The domestic goats were being raised in herds roaming on the hills and other grazing areas, mostly tended by goat herders who were children or teenagers, like the well-known shepherd, and these grazing methods are still being used until now.
The methods of transportation in England were adopted at a time dating back to the sixteenth century.
Although the old Qatari carts were only wooden planks lined up in front of each other, the horses were given the opportunity to pull them so that they could be fast and also pull heavy loads, if we compare them with the roads that were tough during that time.
The cross ties were initially used to secure the rails in place. But gradually they realized that if they installed an iron rod above the tracks, it would improve its efficiency.
This has become a common knowledge, but the iron caused wooden wheels of the carts to rust.
In the end, they replaced the wooden wheels with iron wheels. And in the year 1767, they installed the first complete iron rails.
Walking was the first means of transportation, and humans started walking upright around two million years ago, which was the time when Homo erectus appeared.
Ancestors of the Astralopithecus used to walk in a straight line as they were accustomed to.
And there are also species with legs in the Australopithecus excavations from 4.2 to 3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs from seven million years.
We can start living in a way that is more in line with the environment, and we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is exactly like treating symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem and deal with it.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and the problems have become bigger due to the increase in population and the luxurious lifestyle of humans.
After the Congress was warned on July 4th that there was a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson, some of the buildings followed to John Donlap's printing press.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies are made, now known as "Dunlap cash bulletins".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon at Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of them was addressed to George Washington on the 6th of July, and he read it to his forces in New York on the 9th of July. A copy of it reached London on the 10th of August.
The Dunlap broadsides represent the oldest surviving copies of the United States Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten version has not been found.
Many paleontologists today are confident that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still living today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think that these are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that are still similar to dinosaurs.
They have feet with outer protective layers and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a tyrannosaurus.
All the computers currently in use rely on processing encrypted information in the form of binary numbers.
It is possible for a binary number to have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits - if we use the language of computers.
Internal poisoning may not show its symptoms in time. Immediate diagnosis cannot be made when symptoms like vomiting appear, which are generally common enough.
The best indicator of poisoning indoors could be the presence of an open container for medications or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the ticket so you can know the first aid instructions for the specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "pest" in its official meaning to refer to these insect groups.
This term is derived from ancient knowledge about bedbugs, which are insects that have adapted greatly to parasitizing humans.
The deadly remains and bed bugs have traits like their incubation period, and they can also live in a nest or their host's habitat.
America alone has about 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most prevalent neurologic disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to be affected by Multiple Sclerosis.
There is a man and a woman they see from their perspective, not from their interest or their little child's interest, that they raise a young child.
The couples can choose to make a plan to adopt for their children.
In the adoption process, the biological parents waive their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.
The main purpose of science is for you to understand how the world works using a scientific approach. This method actually guides most scientific research.
Despite that, she is not unique in this matter, and experimentation and experience are considered a test that can be used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Scientists of nature and philosophers focused on ancient texts, specifically on the gospel in Latin language.
Aristotle's opinions were accepted in all scientific subjects, even psychology.
When the level of knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from the philosophical and scientific roots of the Greeks.
Many of the rhythms observed in the science of organ functions and behavior depend largely on the presence of internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The regular rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, have been found in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillations that operate in cycles one after the other, even without external influences.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the important pieces of evidence that DNA is a hereditary material.
Hershey and Chase use bacteriophages or viruses to introduce their DNA into the bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to distinguish whether she was using radioactive DNA for the smallpox virus with phosphorus, or the smallpox virus protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation and the importance of the affected genetic material, whether the affected cells are from the bacterial line or not.
But mutations in germ line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in somatic cells can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, including wild plant and animal life.
Examples of activities that can be done on the site include fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting gardens, and studying information about the ecosystem.
Examples include visiting, taking pictures, and learning about the jungle people in Borneo.
People drive from small towns in their cars every morning to go to their workplaces, and on the way they meet other people who work in the place they left just now.
In a transportation system that is vital, everyone supports and is connected to a transportation system based on private cars.
Nowadays, science indicates that the great economy which is based on carbon has destabilized the atmosphere, and has supported human development over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses transportation systems. They all complain about the transportation systems.
It's rare to hear in advanced countries similar levels of complaints about the quality of water or the bridges that collapse.
Why do transportation systems cause these complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are the transportation engineers not competent? Or is there something more important happening?
Traffic movement means studying the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they engage in with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it is not possible to accurately predict driver behavior.
Fortunately, drivers always tend to act rationally; and that's why traffic flow becomes balanced, and can be represented in an approximate way.
In order to clarify the flow of traffic more effectively, there are relationships between the three main properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing and operating road facilities.
In English: Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape from enemies more easily and to access food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings backward along the length of their body.
This gives them a larger collection of small places to hide from predatory animals.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward are dragonflies and mayflies.
For many years, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people saw that he was right but many saw the opposite, and that the solar system revolves around the earth including the sun (and even the other stars).
It seems logical, because you don't feel the earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It has more water than 8 times the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, at times reaching 6 miles wide.
20 percent of the water that flows from all the rivers on the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon River, glory to God.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long, and it collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the building of the pyramids with stones continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but the pyramids of Giza have not been surpassed in size and artistic excellence in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians in the modern kingdom were amazed by the remains of those who preceded them, which lasted for over a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and has the fewest population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language for its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of daily life used by most of the people working in the country, but Latin is used mainly in religious ceremonies.
The inhabitants of the Vatican all belong to the Roman Catholic denomination.
People have known that there are essential chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, so it is possible to discover all of these elements in nature in their original form and they can be extracted relatively easily using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory stating that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was almost the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it was assumed later that they transform into new materials to form what we see.
Alloys are originally a mixture of two or more metals. And don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered minerals. Of course, there are also other minerals like silver and gold.
You can also take alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is created from matter. And all materials are created from tiny particles called atoms.
The particles are very small, so small that trillions of them can fit into the size of the dot at the end of this sentence.
: Secondly, the pencil was a good friend because many people relied on it when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing tools, the status of the pencil has diminished and we no longer use it except in rare cases.
People can now write messages on the computer screen without needing to use the keyboard.
A person only wonders about what the keyboard will be like when something newer comes out.
The nuclear bomb works by gathering energy to form a nucleus filled with protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy ball up a hill. The nucleus breathes again and releases some of that energy.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to decay with or without any external force.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. And the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The reef extends for about 70 kilometers on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
He is thinner below Maria and thicker below the highlands.
There may be a lot of lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface.
Content theories focus on the idea that people seek out what attracts and stimulates them.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs or desires that manifest themselves as soon as they reach the stage of adolescence.
These theories deal with what makes people do what they do, and the environmental factors that influence them to do or not do certain things.
Two famous theories of content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two behavioral patterns that may appear when managers start leading their previous colleagues. One of them is the attempt to remain "one of the colleagues" (or the others).
This type of manager faces difficulty in making unpopular decisions and implementing disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, determining responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, one turns into a person that you can't recognize and feels the need to change everything the team was doing and make it his own.
After all that, the leader is the one who bears the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team members.
The virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Most virtual team members serve as a point of contact for their physical immediate teams.
Usually, they have more independence than members of traditional teams because their teams may gather based on different time zones that may not be understood through their local management.
The existence of a real hidden team (Larson and LaFasto ,1989, p109) was described as unparalleled because of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team that every member reports to, and is responsible for setting the specific standards for each member.
When does an organization want to establish an educational organization in a time-consuming process? Innovation is considered one of the goals of implementing institutional learning concepts.
When you effectively utilize all available resources through functional departments in the organization, creativity and innovation can be achieved.
As a result, the collaboration within the organization to overcome the difficulties may lead us to a new innovative process that meets the client's needs.
Before the organization can innovate, the management must create a culture of innovation and knowledge sharing alongside education for the organization.
Angel (2006) explains the method called continuity and uses it to help organizations reach a high level of performance.
The data related to neuroscience provides tangible evidence for the theoretical approach when seeking knowledge. This helps narrow down the research area and make it precise and powerful.
The correlation between neuroscience and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It is well known for a long time that different types of brain damage, shocks, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore the brain's structures and processes in a way that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence closely resembles science fiction, it is still a very important branch of computer science that deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
The aim of researching artificial intelligence is to make machines carry out tasks in an automatic way, and this requires a smart method.
Examples include control, planning, creating tables, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and also the ability to recognize handwriting, voice, and facial features.
These things have become separate fields focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is currently being used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and it is also being used to build a set of software applications on home computers and video games.
Field trips are considered a big part of any school semester. Often times, the teacher may want to accompany her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology provides the solution through virtual field trips. Students can see historical artifacts in the museum, visit the aquarium, or enjoy fine art while sitting with their classmates in the classroom.
Participating in a virtual field trip is a great way for us to think about a trip and exchange experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennett school design a website about their trip to the capital of North Carolina every year, and the website is redesigned every year, but they keep the old versions online as a record.
Blogs can help improve students' writing. At the beginning, students often experience inaccurate writing in blogs, but the presence of the audience changes all of that.
Since the students are the largest audience criticized at many times, the blogger seeks to improve his writing so that he is not exposed to criticism.
Blogs also "force students to be smart with the world around them". There is a motivation to nourish the audience's interest, which makes students talented and beneficial (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that enables people to collaborate and encourages students to continue learning even after the regular school day.
The proper use of blogs allows students to engage in more analysis and criticism through their effective response to internet materials, as well as expressing their position on the writings of others, and presenting their own perspectives on specific topics (Arafat, 2002).
Ottawa is the attractive capital of Canada that has two main languages and has some artistic exhibitions and museums that show Canada's past and present.
The Niagara Falls are located in the far south, and the north has a natural beauty that is not fully utilized like Muskoka and the area behind it.
All of these things and more are considered by Ontarians as Canadians as the outsiders see them as His Excellency the Canadian.
Vast areas in the north with few inhabitants, and some are almost uninhabited.
For comparison of the census that surprises many people: The population of African Americans in America is greater than the population of Canadians.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island and is considered an independent continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are either independent countries or are associated with France, and they are named luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country, and it spread widely in the Comoros Islands and Mayotte.
The start of European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama successfully found a sea route to the Cape of Good Hope, connecting Europe to India.
From the north, the African coast surrounds the region, and it is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean from the south and west.
As for women: without looking at the actual social status, women who will travel must declare that they are married.
He's helping her to put on the ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to know that cultural differences can lead to harassment and that it is common for them to be followed and grabbed by the arm, etc.
You have to be strong in front of the men, and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or otherwise should not make the matter acceptable!).
The new city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic trading post called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it again with the name Casa Branca, then they abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru Al-Badyah, and the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is not one of the attractive places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Anyone can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan goods all over the city, such as tagines, clayware, leather goods, shisha, and all cheap items, but all of this is for tourists only.
Goma is a tourist city located in the Democratic Republic of Congo and its location is in the far east near Rwanda.
The eruption of Mount Nyiragongo in 2002 destroyed a large part of the city and especially the downtown area.
Any visits outside Goma need to be researched in order to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province, while Goma is relatively safe.
The city is a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and some of the cheapest ways to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can ride the Boda Boda (a motorcycle that operates as a taxi) to tour the city of Goma, and the regular price (local) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
The "Timbuktu" area is used as a metaphor for distant foreign lands because it is difficult to access.
Timbuktu is a poor city nowadays, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and having an airport.
In the year 1990, sites in danger of being threatened by desertification were added to the World Heritage List.
One of Henry Louis Gates' main stations in the PBS series was about the wonders of the African continent.
The city has a big contrast with the rest of the country's cities, because its character is more Arab than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, and it extends parallel to the borders of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the areas that attracts in South Africa, and is considered one of the best national parks in South Africa.
There are maintenance and entry fees imposed in the garden, like all the public gardens in South Africa.
It is beneficial for you to buy a Wild Card, because it allows you to access a selected group of South African parks or all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives the region of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider a major attraction.
The buildings that look like the rows that draw the skyline of Hong Kong resemble a shiny graph that appears above the waters of Victoria Harbor.
In order to see the best views in Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the seafront in Kowloon on the other side.
The vast majority of urban development in Hong Kong Island is heavily concentrated on the reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place used by the British colonizers as their own place, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is considered the largest mangrove belt in the world, stretching for 80 km (50 miles) into areas off the coasts of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its name is part of the forest located in the Indian territory of the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just swamps for mangrove trees; they contain the last evidence of the dense jungles that once covered the Ganges River.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometers, about one third of which is water and swamps.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for wildlife, currently home to 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses run from the bus station between the areas (along the river) all day, although most of them, especially those going to the east and Jacar/Boomethang, run between 06:30 and 07:30.
The buses that move between neighborhoods are always full, it's best to buy tickets early, a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by Japanese mini coaster buses, which are comfortable and powerful.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to places nearby, like Baro (Nu 150) and Bunaakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the two towers is 83 meters, and their length is 378 meters, with two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is six meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when all Brazilian customs inspection points are completed.
The Guaraní were the main indigenous group that lived in the area we now know as Eastern Paraguay, and they used to live like semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers, also practicing subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes like the Ayoreo and the Paiaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, which was previously called "the Giant Indian Reservation", emerged in the 16th century due to the confrontation between the Spanish invaders and the native population.
The Spanish started the colonial era which lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asuncion, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous worldwide for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will be held in December at the Polo fields in Las Canitas.
Next to that, you can also attend smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
If you want to know news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
It is possible to exchange currency at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley on the other side of the FIC West store.
You can use the British pound everywhere on the island, and also use Stanley credit cards and US dollars at many times.
At remote islands, credit cards might not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; make sure to check with the owners in advance to know the accepted payment methods.
It is impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the island, so you have to exchange the money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, there will be summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in semi-tropical areas, with temperatures often exceeding 30 degrees Celsius in the summer months.
The winter can be deceptively cold: temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity make it feel colder than what the thermometer shows.
The amount of rain remains consistent throughout the year, at a time when there are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons.
Despite many of the animals in the park being used to seeing humans, wild life is still wild and it's not appropriate to feed or disturb them.
According to the park management, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful they may seem, it is possible for bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals to attack.
Many visitors every year get attacked because they don't maintain a safe distance. These animals are big, wild, and possibly dangerous, so they need their space.
Next to that, be careful because smells attract bears and other wild animals, so don't carry or cook foods with strong smell and maintain the cleanliness of the camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. And this city is located on the island of Upolu and its population is less than 40,000 people.
Abu Dhabi was founded in the 1950s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of fierce naval confrontations in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank except for one British warship. About 200 Americans and Germans died.
The peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the leader Toppo Tamasisi Lelofi III during the struggle for Maow movement independence.
Because Oakland is located between two ports, it has many beaches, the famous ones are located in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
All the beaches are sandy and allow for almost safe swimming, most of them are shaded by palm trees.
Shut the Tarak Tamaki beaches are located on the port of Whitianga, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
The family beaches can be crowded at times with a good variety of shops lining the beach. Swimming is safe.
The basic popular beer is called "Number One", so it's not a complex drink, but it's a fun and refreshing beverage. The other local beer is not.
French wine has many varieties, but New Zealand and Australian wine can have wide spread.
The tap water is safe to drink locally, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're worried.
As for Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is strange. The small black coffee is "espresso", and cappuccino has a layer of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is suitable for Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent despite being expensive.
Many trips to the coral reefs occur throughout the year, and it is rare for the coral reefs to be damaged for any reason.
Despite that, seek advice from the authorities, adhere to all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cube jellyfish are found near the beaches and river mouths from October to April, north of 1770. And they can also be found at times other than these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and will swim away if they see one.
Saltwater crocodiles mostly do not live in the ocean, but their primary habitat is in the river deltas north of Rockhampton.
Booking early gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep as soon as he arrives at his destination.
Despite being able to find other types of accommodation booking, such as camping places through a travel agent, travel agents usually deal with specific hotels.
The custom has been for travel agents to offer packages including breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, and even bundled packages including flights and hotels.
They can hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain another document for your destination (like a visa).
Despite that, any modifications or requests should be made through the travel agent initially and not through the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of people attending the music festivals decide to camp on site and consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to get closer to the events, you have to enter early to get a camping spot close to the music.
