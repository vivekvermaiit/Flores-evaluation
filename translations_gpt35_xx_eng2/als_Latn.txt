This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already known, but provides details that cannot usually be ensured by fossils, such as color and three-dimensional presentation.
According to scientists, in the upper part this animal had brown-colored feathers and, in the lower part, feathers with a dull or carotenoid color.
This discovery also gives us an idea about the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the vertebrae of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed central axis called the "rachis", but they share other characteristics with the structure of modern vertebrae, such as processes and barbels, researchers concluded that the rachis could be a more advanced evolutionary development than these features.
The structure of the feathers makes you think they were not used for flight, but more for regulating temperature or display. Researchers believe the example shows an adult feather, not a bird's down, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur.
The researchers were of the opinion that, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the sample shows a grown tree trunk and not a small bird's tail.

The completed work was more theoretical even though the program was designed for simulating the observations made on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for could be caused by the gravitational forces between dark matter in the galaxy and dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational force on the Earth and causes tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the constellation of Sagittarius.
The scientists managed to conclude that dark matter has an influence on another dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a halo shape and is made up of many small particles.

Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and insert into an envelope a pre-printed paper where they indicate the chosen candidate.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.

Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes inside before the voting starts, and that no envelopes are added except those of the properly numbered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives as witnesses of every part of the process. Votes are counted in the evening by volunteers under strict control, applying the proper procedures.

The victims were Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old, and Nicholas Alden, 25 years old. Cuddeback had been the driver of the car.
Edgar Veguilla was wounded in the arm and chest, while Kristoffer Schneider suffered injuries that required surgery to reconstruct his face.
The gun of Ukë was blocked when he aimed it at the head of the fifth person. Schneider has continuous pain, is blind in one eye, is missing part of the skull, and his face has been reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified through a video link from a U.S. Embassy base in his home country.
In addition to Wednesday's activity, Carpanedo also competed in two individual races in the championship.
Her first was the long jump, where she took "Did not finish" in her first attempt. 36 out of 116 competitors achieved the same result in that race.

He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoja has been accused of killing her son at the first-level court in Edinburgh.
She is in pretrial detention awaiting recognition of the accusation and the start of the trial, but any evidence from the eyewitness can be corrupted because her image has been widely publicized.
This is a common practice found in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice operates differently and courts have considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial to the case.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee emphasizes that "it seems that journalists are treading on dangerous ground if they publish photos, etc. of suspected individuals".
The office of the Prosecutor, which is responsible for all criminal investigations, told reporters that there will be no further comments at least until the indictment is issued.
According to the information, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants according to the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
It is believed that other covered topics include the future state of Jerusalem, which is holy for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel, until the signing of this agreement, seeks to have a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years, while the Palestinian authorities agree to allow their presence for only five years.
The pickers needed to be closely monitored by the guards during the additional trial of monitoring harmful animals, as the trial was monitored and evaluated for its effectiveness.
In a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Australian Sports Hunters Association, qualified volunteers were recruited under the hunting program of the Australian Sports Hunters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, deputy director for Conservation and Heritage of the Park at NPWS, the four selected hunters for the first hunting operation were given extended instructions for their safety and training.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in front of a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
This is the fifth temporary Electoral Council for Martelin in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Interim Election Council as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were caused by the lack of development of the elections, some of which have been expected since 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) declared that it had been informed about 27 equipment-related accidents.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced last week that "Apple" had informed them of 34 other serious incidents of overheating.
The ministry reacted by calling the delay of the report from Apple "truly regrettable".
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 am local time (Friday at 09:19 am Greenwich time).
The Emergency Management Office of Northern Mariana Islands expressed that damages were not reported in the area.
The Tsunami Warning Center in Pacific said there was no evidence of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza aimed his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released first, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly person after she needed to go to the bathroom. They thought and shot her with a gun.
The son followed his father's example and started a career in medicine.
He was trained as an obstetrician and started working at the Oakland National Hospital for Women in 1959.
When he was working in the hospital, Liginsi started to research premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that, if a hormone is administered, it would accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs in newborns.
"Xinhua" reported that state investigators found on Wednesday two flight recorders of the "black box" type.

Tomi Drimer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a night with two moons. Quite rare, like herself. A strong woman."
Dastin "Goldast" Ranelsi commented that: "Luna was as strange as I... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... hope she is in a better place".
In a survey of 1400 people before the 2010 federal elections, opponents of Australia's return to a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the campaign for the 2010 federal elections, Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the people in the survey share this opinion, according to which they wish for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In the survey responses, 29 percent of the respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The winner of the Olympic gold medal was supposed to swim in 100 and 200 meters freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical form has not been secure.
He couldn't get the right medications to overcome his pain, as they are prohibited by the Games.
Kurtis Kuper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the Central Missouri University, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
The discovery was verified by many people using different devices and software in early February, and this was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets have been a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic materials that can create proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand the creation of planets, especially how Earth was created from the collision of comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and foolishness".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA's claims, will allow airplanes to move on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
He uses satellite technology, compared to the old technology based on ground radars, to allow air traffic controllers to locate the aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
Additional transport vehicles will not be put in place and the overground trains will not stop at "Uembli", and parking facilities for cars, as well as parking and traveling, are not available for the gaming area.
The fear of lack of transportation increased the possibility that the game would be played forcibly with closed doors without the support of the team.
A study published on Thursday in the magazine Shkenca reported the creation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden, announced that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process lasted longer, due to the crossbreeding between an endemic finch of Darwin, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in all kinds of ways. It can be melted into tiny shapes.
He can be drawn and become a thin wire, which can then be used and twisted. He can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
He could be carved too much and joined with other metals. He could be carved so much that he was sometimes used to decorate the images painted by hand in the books called "Illuminated Manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can prepare an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on the acidic or alkaline level of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H+) in the chemical being analyzed.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (as hydrogen atoms consist of one electron and one proton).
Mix the two dry powders and then, with wet and clean hands, squeeze to form a ball.
Moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, which will give a strange feeling and will form a kind of residue.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, connected to a fairly complex sewage system.
In the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remains of black water systems have been found.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of mixed public baths for men and women.
When you make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then returns it again, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by means of a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
For the placement of a satellite or telescope in space, a giant rocket with a height of over 100 feet is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing that the wheel has brought to us is that it has provided us with a much faster and much easier mode of transportation.
She has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are the cats bigger than the average ones that are fed with prey of average size, ranging from lynxes to antelopes and deer.
In conclusion, there are many small cats (including feral cats) that eat many more small animals such as insects, reptiles, rodents, and birds.
Their secret of success is the concept of the comfort zone, a unique feature that every cat has that doesn't allow it to compete with others.
Lions are the most social felines. They live in large groups called prides.
The packs consist of one to three closely related adult males, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Women, being part of a large family of sisters and daughters, generally have closer relationships with each other.
The packs of wolves behave like packs of lions or dogs, animals with behavior that remarkably resembles that of wolves (but not of other large cats) and also very deadly for their prey.
As a well-trained athlete, a tiger can climb (although not very well), swim, leap over long distances, and drag with the strength of five powerful people.
The tiger is in a group (panther genus) with the lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the four big cats which can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but is more like a sentence with words of groans and screams.
Ocelots prefer to feed on small animals. When they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller in size than it.
Scientists believe that wolves track and find their prey through scent, sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the darkness with their night vision and they move very stealthily as well. They hunt their prey by blending in with the surrounding environment and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) gets separated from the main population they came from (e.g. if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they go to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than where they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than a necessary competitor before.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adjustments as before.
With the passage of time, with the beginning of the adaptation of the new population to its environment, it begins to appear less and less similar to the other population.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they will not be able to be considered the same kind.
This process is called speciation, which simply involves the creation of new species. Speciation is a very important part and inevitable consequence of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people inhale and absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale (i.e., exhale through respiration).
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build houses with plants and create clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaur was the super predator of his time, so he was not afraid of anything, except for other mosasaurs.
His long tusks were filled with over 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in his palate, meaning that nothing that stood in his way could escape from him.
We do not know for sure, but he may have had a language like a pirate. His diet included frogs, large fish, other small reptiles, and he may have been a cannibal.
He would attack everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could not defeat it.
Although we would recognize most of their food, the Romans had quite a few strange or unusual items for feasts, including wild boar, dormouse, worms and a type of snail called gjer.
Another difference was that, while poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs, wealthy men preferred to dine together at banquets, where they ate their meals laid out on tables.
The meals of the ancient Romans could not have included foods that came from America or Asia to Europe during the subsequent centuries.
They, for example, had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and there is not even an ancient Roman who has ever tasted sea corn.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple called the house of the god.
The people paid homage to the lords and the priests tried to take care of the needs of the lords through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple yard and then an inner sanctuary where only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes as an integral part of the temples, special towers in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built.
The top of the tower was a special place of worship for the lord.
The house didn't have that much importance in the hot climate of the Middle East.
Life in the Hebrew family mainly took place in the open air.
The women were cooking in the yard; the shops were simply open stalls with a street view. Stone was used to build the houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland had few settlements. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder and, on his journeys westward, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time despite its discovery.
Although every state was "Scandinavian", among the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland there were quite a few differences.
If you've seen the movie "The National Treasure", you might think that behind the Declaration of Independence there was a treasure map written.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written behind the document, it is not a treasure map.
Behind the Declaration of Independence was written "The original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the end of this document, written upside down.
Meanwhile, while no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence, the great parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for preservation.
For this reason, it is possible that the label be placed only as a tag.
The landings of D-Day and the subsequent battles had liberated the northern part of France, but the south remained occupied.
He was governed by the French of the Vichy regime. They were French who, in 1940, had chosen to make peace with the Germans and had collaborated with the occupiers, instead of fighting against them.
The allies invaded Southern France on August 15, 1940 and the invasion was named "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks, the Americans and the forces of the freedom movement had liberated Southern France and were continuing towards Germany.
Civilization is called a distinct and common culture of a quite large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word "civilization" originates from the Latin word "civilis" which means "civil", which is connected to the Latin word "civis" which means "citizen" and "civitas" which means "city" or "city-state", which in a way also determines the size of the society.
City-states are the predecessors of states. A city culture implies the transmission of knowledge through several generations, a traceable cultural heritage, and a fair spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving proper historical evidence and fail to be recognized as fully-fledged civilizations.
During the American War for Independence, the thirteen colonies first created a weak central government - with Congress as its only structure - according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have any power to impose taxes and, since it did not have a national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, which were often uncooperative, for the enforcement of all its laws.
He also did not have the competencies to violate laws on taxes and tariffs between states.
The leaders were seeking unanimous approval from all states before the changes could be made, and the central government took it so lightly that their representatives often did not attend.
The Italian national football team, like the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and in 2006, they were the champions of the FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, starting with the Italians who compete in both international games and Olympic activities.
Japan contains nearly 7000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the grouping of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in geographical terms, as an "archipelago".
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors who passed by recorded the island's name as "Ilha Formosa" or "beautiful island".
Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, initiating a transformation of local rice and sugar production practices and employing Chinese laborers on its plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas in the west and north of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it gave sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which led it until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main buildings, specifically: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings on the complex's sides have been reconstructed to give tourists a more accurate idea of how they looked originally.
Thirty percent of Maçi Pasha's house had been restored by 1976 and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most common format of still photography in the world is 35 mm, which was the predominant size of film at the end of the analog film era.
It continues to be produced today and above all, in the same inherited format from the image sensor of a digital camera.
The 35 mm format is, in fact, somewhat confusing, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The report of this format (split into twelve to get the simplest report with whole numbers) comes out as 3:2.
Many common patterns (e.g. the family of APS patterns) are the same or very similar to this visualization report.
The rule of thirds, often abused and frequently ridiculed, is a simple guiding line that creates dynamism by maintaining a degree of regularity in an image.
He determines that the most effective place for the main subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful and wealthy, was viewed with a scrutinizing eye.
For over a thousand years, the Christian faith had connected European states to each other, regardless of differences in language and customs.
His power, felt everywhere, touched everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the main dogmas of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are specifically there for that reason.
The main organs of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many people doubt whether this principle was being applied.
Immediately after the start of the military conflict, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective by interrupting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violates the generally accepted international law, which was codified through several international agreements in the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent the entry of all ships in parts of the ocean, even endangering neutral vessels.
Since the reaction to this tactic was minimal, Germany hoped for a similar reaction for its borderless war with the underground.
The dominant attitudes of the majority of citizens and nations during the 1920s were pacifism and isolationism.
After the horrors and atrocities during the First World War, nations wanted to avoid the recurrence of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla immigrated to the United States of America to accept a job at the "Edison" company in the city of New York.
He arrived in the USA with only 4 cents in his account, a book of poetry, and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of recounting different time periods; each stage of China or each ruling family was a recognized dynasty.
Similarly, between each of the dynasties there was an unstable period with separate provinces. The most well-known period among them was the era of the Three Kingdoms which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was a fierce war among many nobles who fought for the throne.
"The Three Kingdoms" was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, in which thousands of people died fighting for the highest position in the great palace in Xian.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, as well as the belief that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, job opportunities were also opened for all male applicants, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
This also applies to the military because instead of the army ranks being based on categories, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class peoples in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was most interested in issues beyond this worldly life. He often went to meditate in a cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light).
The self-power that survived the ages gives a very vivid reflection of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
This cave, which is located at the top of one of the mountains in the north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find it at all, even if you know it exists. Once you enter the cave, you are completely isolated.
You can’t see anything else except for the clear and beautiful sky above and the many mountains that surround you. From inside the cave, you can only see or hear very little from this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that continues to resist today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The plateau of Giza or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt has several pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Khufu), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of the wives and members of Khufu's family.
The "upper arc" looks like a V and the "lower arc" looks like a loop or a square without the bottom line.
"Upper" implies that you should start at the top and push the bow, and "lower" implies that you should start at the loop (which is where the hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
The upper string produces generally a sweeter sound, while the lower string is stronger and more determined.
You can keep your notes, but don't forget that the printed curved signs are there for musical purposes, so they should usually be respected.
King Louis XVI, terrified, queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris with a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage completely open.
At one point, a member of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The expenses of the American imperialism's war to occupy the Philippines were paid by the Filipino population themselves.
They were obliged to pay the colonial regime taxes to the United States to cover a significant part of the expenses, and the interest on the obligations was thrown on the stock exchange in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the profits generated from the excessive exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main gains of American imperialism.
Someone needs to understand the circumstances that prompted the creation of the order for the templars to understand.
The period when the events occurred is usually referred to as the Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally end around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, from technological advancement or the necessity of technology to the narrow understanding that human destiny is guided by a basic logic linked to the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two main common ideas: that the development of technology follows a path beyond cultural or political influence and that technology, on the other hand, has "effects" on societies that are natural, unaffected by social influences.
Someone may say, for example, that the vehicle definitely contributes to the improvement of the roads.
However, an international road network is not economically viable for a small number of vehicles, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Ownership of vehicles also leads to a higher percentage of road accidents, which has led to the development of new techniques in healthcare for repairing injured bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, brought by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geographically the people of Brumos and over time gave birth to customs and cultures linked to that geography, and, as they were in harmony with the place of society, they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
His reputation as a center of luxury began around the 4th century AD and lasted until around the 11th century AD.
His position fell during the twelfth century, especially due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned bringing such gifts as: spices and perfumes, which were more valued than what the Byzantine markets offered.
During this time, the transfer of the title as the fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris was also completed.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, as a result of slow communication channels, Western styles may remain 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a new style. One of the major developments of the time that came as a result of the crusades was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Existential agriculture is the agriculture applied to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Existential farming is a simple, often organic, system that utilizes local seeds combined through crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
Historically, the majority of farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and the situation continues to remain the same in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together individuals who think alike, who feel disregarded by social norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the ethnicity, age, location, class, and/or gender of their members.
The distinguishing criteria of a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often demonstrate their membership by using a particular and symbolic style that includes fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to base it on some unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortunes or intentional abuse, have not been socialized with adults during their upbringing.
These children are called "wild" or primitive. Some wild children are kept confined by humans (usually by their parents); this abandonment of the child was in some cases due to the parents' non-acceptance of the child's severe intellectual or physical disorder.
Wild children may have been subjected to severe child abuse or trauma before abandonment or separation.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and for some it is said that they have lived alone in nature.
When completely raised by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely identical to that of the particular caring animal, such as fear or indifference towards people.
Meanwhile, the method of learning through projects should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding-supported learning takes it a step further.
The method of teaching through scaffolding is not a learning method, but, on the contrary, it is an auxiliary tool that provides support to people who are undergoing a new learning experience, such as: using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scales can be virtual and real, meaning a teacher is a kind of scale, but so is the little man in the shape of the cursor in Microsoft Office.
Virtual skeletons are processed by the software and aim to investigate, stimulate, and explain the procedures that the learner may have had difficulty handling alone.
Children are sent to the children's home for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, and even blackmail.
No child should be raised, under any circumstances, in an environment that is not encouraging, loving and educational, yet they are growing up in this way.
We consider the Foster Care System as a safe zone for these children.
Our care system is expected to provide loving caregivers, safe homes, secure health care, and ongoing education.
The caretaker is supposed to provide all the missing needs of the home where they were before.
The internet intertwines both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to different dimensions in terms of access for uses and pleasures.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are proposed as important incentives to use the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal commitment" and "ongoing relationships" have also been identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they observed how the audience reacted on internet pages.
The use of video recordings has brought important findings to explain micro-expressions and facial movements that last for just a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that someone can detect if a person is lying through accurate interpretation of his facial expressions.
In his speech "The President's Speech," Oliver Saks showed how people who are not able to understand the speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess its sincerity.
He even thought that such abilities to explain human behavior could also be possessed by animals, for example, pet dogs.
The studies of the twentieth century have proven that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variant and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variants.
Variation in the form of recombination and mixing repeats between the two groups with each generation.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to meet its need for amino acids through the plant resources of the savannah.
Moreover, the failure to achieve this has serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
Plant sources that are easily accessible would be the proteins derived from leaves and legumes, but primates like us find it difficult to digest them if they are not cooked.
On the contrary, foods derived from animals (mollusks, insects, eggs) not only digest easily but also provide large amounts of proteins that have all the necessary amino acids.
Taking into account all things, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved "their protein problem" somewhat like the savanna chimpanzees do today.
The interruption of sleep is the process of intentional awakening during your normal sleep period and of falling asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a digital alarm clock with a relatively low volume to wake you up without fully arousing you.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed to force someone to wake up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person possesses is in direct proportion to the level of tension in his body and spirit.
With the lowering of tension, the current vital force increases. Every individual has the opportunity to find peace and absolute joy.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but further enriched with the theological thought of "the path of love" of the Mahayana and more techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan meditation center is divine yoga. Through the visual presentation of several deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, bringing cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, clashes of system, process, and culture led to the confrontation of states.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies and thus the Cold War began.
She would continue for the next 40 years and would be truly fought by authorized armies in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and in many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian border.
However, these planes came out of use almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after the occupation of the Eastern Polish regions, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transportation of goods is currently the most efficient way to move large quantities of goods and people across the ocean.
The task of naval fleets has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans were attempting to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet was trying to block the traffic using mainly submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have been able to conquer Britain, just as it had happened with other countries in Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Household goats were generally kept in herds that grazed on hillsides or other pastures, often under the care of shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, more or less like the shepherds that are known more. These methods of livestock preservation are still used today.
The roads for wagons were built in England in the 16th century.
Although the carts were made only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to pull them for achieving greater speeds and for carrying heavier loads than on the slightly more difficult roads of that time.
The crossbars were inserted very early to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually understood that the rails would be more effective if they had an iron sheet on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron consumed more of the wooden wagon wheels.
In the end, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking; people began walking two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning upright man) appeared.
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, usually did not walk on two legs.
The adaptations for walking on two feet have been found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet seven million years ago.
We can start living by respecting the environment more, we can take part in the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is similar to treating the symptoms. However, we need to find the cause of the problems and deactivate it if we do not want just a temporary solution.
It is very clear that the world has undergone major changes due to advances in science and technology, and the problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant way of human life.
After its approval on July 4th by the Congress, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent several blocks further to John Dunlap's printing press.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made which are now known as "The Dunlap Broadside".
The first public reading of the document was done on July 8th by John Nixon in the yard of "Independence Hall".
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it on July 9 in front of his troops in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap leaflets that are known to exist until now are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The first handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe today that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs, as they are with feathers and can fly.
But there are many things regarding birds that are similar to dinosaurs.
They have legs with spurs and claws, lay eggs and walk with their hind legs like a T-Rex dinosaur.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and, in computer language, these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be apparent immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are quite general that can lead to an immediate diagnosis.
The presence of an open box of toxic drugs or household chemicals can be the clearest sign of intoxication.
Check the label for specific instructions for fast assistance for that particular poison.
For this group of insects, entomologists use the term "kandërr" in its official sense.
This term has its origin in the close resemblance to bedbugs, which are highly adapted insects to parasitize humans.
Like killer insects, bed bugs are nocturnal, adapted to live in the bed or in their host's shelter.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most important neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have found that the likelihood of women having multiple sclerosis is twice as high as for men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples can decide on preparing a parenting plan for their baby.
In a adoption, biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most research in science.
But it is not the only one; scientific study also guides experimentation, and experimentation is the proof used for eliminating one or more possible hypotheses, by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in every scientific issue, including psychological ones.
When the knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself cut off from the Greek roots of philosophy and science.
Many rhythms related to physiology and behavior often depend mainly on the presence of endogenous cycles as well as their production by biological clocks.
For the majority of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, documented are the circadian rhythms which are not just a response to external circadian signals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that will continue a cyclic period of free movement, even when external signals are missing.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase was one of the main proposals that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses, or phages, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can bring about a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material that has been affected, and whether the affected cells are germ line cells.
Only mutations of the germ line cells can be transmitted to the children, while mutations in other areas can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism based on nature attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of field activities include fishing, hunting, photography, bird watching, park visits, and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is the development of visits, photography, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the towns by car to go to their workplace and pass by other people whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic movement of transportation, everyone is in a way connected and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Now science shows that the massive carbon-based economy has caused the displacement of the biosphere from one of its sustainable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone has complaints about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, there are rarely so many complaints about the quality of water or broken bridges.
Why do these transportation systems cause these dissatisfactions, why do they fail every day? Aren't the transport engineers just incompetent? Or is something more important happening?
The traffic movement is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic, because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to operate within a consistent time interval; Therefore, traffic flows can be calculated mathematically with precision.
To better represent the flow of traffic, connections have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This coordination helps in the planning, designing, and use of road objects.
Animals, insects were the first to rise in the air. The ability to fly helped them to avoid their predators more easily and find food and reproduce more efficiently.
The majority of insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the length of their body.
This gives them a greater number of small places to hide from the robbers.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings behind them are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus said that the solar system rotates around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite; that the solar system, including the Sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the Earth.
This seems logical, because the Earth doesn't seem to move, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on Earth and the widest. It carries 8 times more water than the river that is ranked second.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a width of six miles in some cases.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river, the Amazon, is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It collects the water of thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the scale and technical perfection of the construction of the pyramids of Giza was never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were at that time much older than a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world with the smallest population.
The city of Vatican uses Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used every day by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have had knowledge since ancient times about such basic chemical elements as: gold, silver, and copper, as all of these can be found in nature in their original form and can be relatively easily extracted from mines with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, raised the theory that everything is composed of the combination of one or more of the four elements. Those elements were earth, air, water, and fire.
This resembled more the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also created the theory that they transform into new materials to create anything we see.
Alloys are fundamentally a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that in the periodic table there are many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Without a doubt, there also exist metals such as silver and gold.
You can also obtain alloys involving small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can fit at the end of this sentence.
In this way, with its invention, the pen became a good friend for many people.
Unfortunately, after the introduction of the newest writing methods, the status and use of the pen have declined.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever needing to use a pen.
Someone can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes out.
The atomic bomb functions on the principle that the fusion of some protons and neutrons with a nucleus requires energy.
Similar to lifting a heavy cart up a hill, separating the wheel from the axle releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to spontaneously break apart or with even the smallest disturbance.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The slope is about 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the dark side of the moon.
She is thinner in the dark areas and thicker in the mountainous areas.
There may be more seas on the nearby side, because the crust is thinner. The lava had an easier time rising to the surface.
Theories of content focus on finding what makes people choose or attract them.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires, which they hold within as they grow older.
These theories analyze what makes some people desire the things they desire and which things in their environment will push them to do or not do certain things.
Two widely spread theories regarding content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two attitudes can be revealed when managers start to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unconventional decisions, to establish disciplinary measures, to make performance evaluations, to assign tasks and responsibilities to each individual.
On the other end of the spectrum, such a person easily transforms into someone unrecognizable, who thinks they should change everything the team has done and take credit for it.
In the end, the leader holds ultimate responsibility for the success and failure of the team.
Often, this behavior causes division between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to have the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are some minor differences.
The members of the virtual team often function as the point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have more independence than members of the traditional team, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local administration.
A unique component of a virtual team is also the presence of a "hidden team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109).
"The invisible team" is the management team where every member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for every member.
Why would an organization want to undergo the lengthy process of creating an education organization? An objective to implement organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently across the functional sectors of an organization, creativity and ability can be displayed.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a revitalization process to serve the client's needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as the exchange of knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum method as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical treatment of cognitive research. As a result, they narrow the field of research and make it much more precise.
The reciprocal relationship between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their studies.
It is known for a long time that various types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some brain functions.
The birth of new technologies allows us to observe and investigate brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and materials for building simulation models, which help us understand our thought processes.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) has gained strong nuances in science fiction literature, artificial intelligence is a very important branch of computer science, which deals with the intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation of a machine.
Research in AI involves creating devices for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and facial expression.
These things have turned into distinct disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The Artificial Intelligence system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it is involved in several software applications of personal computers and video games.
Excursions take up a large part of every teaching methodology. It often happens that a teacher expresses the desire to send her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field trips. Students can visit museum artifacts, observe an aquarium, or admire beautiful art, all while sitting in their classroom.
Virtual travel in the field is also a great way to think about a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of "Bennet" school in North Carolina create a website dedicated to their trip to the capital, this website is modified every year, but the old versions are still stored on the internet as a memory block.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts efforts to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "compels students to become more intellectually aware of the world around them". The need to nourish the audience's interests inspires students to be sharp and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their knowledge beyond their traditional school day.
The use of blogs in the right way "can help students become more critical and analytical. Through active responses to online materials, students can determine their positions regarding writings from others, as well as to determine their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the bilingual capital city of Canada, which has a series of art galleries and museums presenting the past and present of Canada.
In the south is the Niagara Falls and the north shelters the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these and many others, introduce Ontario with elements that are considered by foreigners as the most typical Canadian.
The large areas located in the north are very sparsely populated and some of them are almost uninhabited and undeveloped regions.
For a comparison of the population that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, along the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island and continent on its own when it comes to wild animals.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or linked to France and are known as luxurious vacation destinations for the beach.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands and it had a great influence on the Comoros and Mayotte islands.
The influence and colonization from Europe started in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel in the north and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
You help even if you wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they consider to be harassment and pursuit, grabbing by the arm, etc. is not uncommon.
Be bold when you reject men and don't be afraid to hold your ground (even if it goes against cultural norms, it doesn't mean it's okay!).
The contemporary city of Casablanca was founded by the Imazighen fishermen in the 10th century B.C. and was then utilized by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru-I-Badia and it was called Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to bargain in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products such as: tagines, ceramic items, leather products, shisha, and a whole range of decorations, but everything is for tourists.
The city of Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the eastern region near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the volcano Niragongo, which covered most of the city's streets and especially the city center.
Although Goma is somewhat safe, you should research every visit outside Goma to understand the situation of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for the climb to Mount Nyiragongo along with some of the mountain gorilla treks in Africa at a lower cost.
You can use a motorbike taxi to move around Goma. The usual price is approximately 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its unattainability, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for distant exotic places.
Timbuktu is today a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
She was added to the list of world heritage sites at risk in 1990, due to the risk of desertification.
She was one of the main stops during the special broadcast of Henri Louis Gates for the Public Broadcasting Service "Wonders of the African World".
The city has a strong contrast with the rest of the cities in this country, because it has more of an Arab style than African.
The national park "Kruger" (KNP) stretches in the northeast of South Africa and goes along the border with Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² divided into 14 different ecosystems, in each of which different wild animals live.
He is one of the major attractions of South Africa and is called the flagship of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
As in all National Parks in Southern Africa, the park has daily fees for entry and conservation.
You can also have the option to buy a "Wild Card", which provides entry to each of the South African national parks or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is considered the main destination by many tourists.
The parade of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a visual graphic with threads that stand out from the presence of the "Victoria" port waters.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, move away from the island and go to the Kowloon promenade across.
The majority of urban development in the island of Hong Kong is focused on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place colonized by the British settlers, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is the suitable place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove coastal belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of the Bengal and Indian coastal zone.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO world heritage site. The forest in the Indian part is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just areas with roots, they include some of the last remaining parts of the large jungles that once covered the northern valley of India.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², approximately one-third of which is covered by water/marshes.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a refuge for wild animals and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and also around 30,000 deer in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although the majority, especially those traveling towards the east and Xhakar/Bumthang, depart from 06:30 to 07:30.
It is advisable to buy the ticket several days in advance, as it often happens that intercity buses are fully booked.
Most regions are serviced by the small Japanese "Coaster" buses, which are comfortable and powerful.
Taking a taxi together is a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (approx. 150 Nu) and Punakha (approx. 200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It stretches over the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two 3.50 m wide lanes.
The vertical space below the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, it did not open for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully functional in September 2017, when the customs control points of Brazil are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture for survival.
The Chaco region was the settlement of other indigenous group such as the guaikuru and pajagua, who secured their livelihood by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, which was previously called "Provincia gigante de los Indios", was created as a result of the confrontation between the Spanish invaders and the local indigenous groups.
The Spanish were the ones who started the period of colonization, a period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous identity and character.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and players in soccer worldwide.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Here smaller tournaments and matches can be seen even in other periods of the year.
For the latest news about tournaments and where to buy polo match tickets, go to the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Folkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is pegged equal to that of a British pound (GBP).
You can exchange the money at the only bank on the islands, which is located at Stanley, in front of the FIC West store.
The British pounds will be generally accepted everywhere in the islands and, within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
In peripheral islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and United States currency may be accepted. It is advisable to consult with the owners in advance to determine what form of payment is accepted.
Outside the islands, it is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands, so please exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zones. In the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can have a cold that deceives: temperatures rarely drop below freezing point, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the temperature shown on the thermometer.
There are no distinct seasons "with rain" and "dry": the level of rain is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park administration, you must stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how wise they may seem, bears, wolves, lynxes, lions, and almost all large animals can attack you.
Every year dozens of visitors get injured because they don't keep the necessary distance. These are wild animals, large and possibly dangerous, and for this reason you should give them the necessary space.
In addition, keep in mind that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid storing or cooking scented food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia, founded in the 1850s, has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval clash in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships sank, except for one British cruiser. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the efforts for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful organization in the city brought about the assassination of the main leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the extension of Okland between the two ports. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches at North Shore (in the North Harbor district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Those are almost all sandy beaches and safe for swimming, and most have shade provided by palm trees.
The beaches of "Tamaki" road are in the Waitemata Harbor, in the elegant outskirts of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches sometimes overcrowded with people and a lot of shops lined up along the shore. You can swim safely.
The main beer in the country is "Number One". It's not a complex beer, but it's refreshing and enjoyable. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines are easier to find.
The tap water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you are worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "plain white" coffee is something foreign. A short black coffee is called "espresso", cappuccino is served covered in cream (and not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is according to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but wonderful.
Throughout the year, there are many car trips and tire damage is rare from any of these causes.
But again, respect the advice of the authorities, respect all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The bioluminescent jellyfish appear near beaches and river deltas from October to April, in the northern part of the 1770 Bay. Occasionally, they may also appear outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are frightened of humans and swim away from them.
Crocodiles of saltwater do not actively live in the ocean. Their main habitat is the river estuaries in the north of Rockhampton.
The advance reservation makes the traveler feel assured that there will be a place to sleep as soon as he arrives at his destination.
Often, travel agents have agreements with specific hotels, although you may find that it is possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to secure other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
"However, any changes or requests must first go through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel."
For some festivals, the overwhelming majority of participants in music festivals choose to camp in the same place and most participants consider it an essential part of this experience.
If you want to be close to the activity, you will need to go early to find a camping spot near the music.
Don't forget that, even if the music may have ended on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross over the North Pole during the winter, check where your cabin is, as movement on ice causes a very terrifying noise for those who are more sensitive.
The cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
The casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by the guests. Usually, there is a lack of windows and clocks, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers for food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and to keep them in their environments.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks. But drinking weakens judgment and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who will drive a vehicle over long geographical distances or mountain passes should consider that there might be snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you cannot steer the vehicle as if you are on clean asphalt.

The segment of the road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated, pristine forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving a vehicle on rural roads, keep your mind in place: steep cliffs, narrow bends and sharp turns predominate.
The marked speed limits are much lower than in the preceding and following sections - usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) - and full compliance with them is even more important than in other circumstances.
Surprisingly, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than during other parts of the road, such as in the "Pennsylvania Wilds".
German buildings are very good and in Bavaria they are very diverse and different, just like those of their neighbor in the south, Austria.

Stirrups are holders for the rider's feet hanging down on either side of the saddle.
They provide better stability for the rider, but they can be a problem for safety due to the possibility of the rider getting their feet stuck in them.
If the rider falls off the horse but has his foot stuck in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, some safety precautions can be taken.
First, the majority of motorcyclists wear boots with heels and soles worn and very narrow.
Then, some scarves, especially English scarves, have safety threads that allow the scarf to fall off if pulled backwards by the rider falling.

Think of the skiing itinerary as a similar itinerary to hiking.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than walking, but very rarely will you achieve skiing speeds on terrain without a heavy backpack on the groomed slopes.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but has many independent states. Under normal conditions, traveling to many countries would require visa applications and extensive passport controls.
However, the Schengen area functions somewhat like a single country in this aspect.
As long as you don't leave this area, you can usually cross the borders without having to go through the passport control points again.
In the same way, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa in each Schengen member country, thus saving time, money, and documents.
There is no general definition of which manufactured articles are antiques. Some tax agencies classify goods as antiques if they are older than 100 years.

Other include Livingston and Deception islands, where a water-filled caldera and an still active volcano offers a stunning natural harbor.
The land of Elsuorth is the region in the south of the peninsula, bordered by the Belingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula come together here on the beach and then reappear to form a 360 km chain of the Ellsworth mountains, which are separated by the Minnesota ice sheet.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range have the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak of Mount Vinson at 4892 m.

Finland is a very good destination for boating. "The land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in these lakes and archipelagos.
Although coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are truly quite large for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boat trips are considered a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but, aside from them, it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands this ratio is one in twenty).
The majority of the special cruises in the Baltic have a long stop in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few full days, while returning and sleeping on the boat at night.
If you go to the beach only through boat excursions, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).

For some, a certain knowledge of how the plane works and what happens during a flight can help them overcome the fear based on the unknown or lack of control over things.
Courier companies are paid well to deliver things quickly. Time is often very important for work documents, goods or exchange parts for urgent repair.
For some routes, the larger companies have their own airplanes, but it was a problem for other routes and smaller companies.
If they were to send things by air transport, for some itineraries it might take days to go through the process of unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get them there faster would be to send them as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow for the sending of baggage without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The easiest way to fly first class or business class is to accumulate a large sum of money for this privilege (or, even better, have the company do this for you).
However, this does not come cheap: as a general rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the normal economy fare for business and eleven times more for first class!
Usually, it's not even worth asking for price reductions for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airline companies know well that there is a specific group of passengers who willingly pay high prices to have the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they set prices according to the circumstances.
