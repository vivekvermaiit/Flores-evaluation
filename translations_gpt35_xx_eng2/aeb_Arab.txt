This is a common practice in Yasser's other businesses in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice operates in a different way, and the courts have considered that the publication of images may be biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee says "It seems to me that journalists are going in a dangerous direction if they publish photos or any information related to any suspect."
The public prosecutor's office in general told journalists not to make any comments until at least after the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, shows that the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants is based on the pre-1967 war borders in the Middle East.
The topics that they say are told about include the future status of Jerusalem, which we consider an important issue for both peoples, along with the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel continues to demand the military presence in the Jordan Valley for a period of ten years, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to the continuation of this presence for a period of five years as it corrects the agreement.

Martelly yesterday took the oath in a new temporary election council with nine members.
This is the fifth interim electoral council for Martili in four years.
In the past month, a presidential committee ordered the resignation of the temporary electoral council as part of a set of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread protests opposing the regime that began in October.
The protests have started, which have become violent, because they failed to hold the elections that were supposed to be held since 2011.
Almost 60 cases of overheating in the "iPod" device have been reported, leading to a total of six fires and causing four people to suffer minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) of Japan said that it had in mind 27 incidents related to appliances.
Last Friday, METI announced that Apple reported 34 additional incidents of phones overheating, and the company classified them as "not serious".
The ministry responded to the request to postpone the report by saying "unfortunately true".

Out of 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the percentage of opponents to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% from 2008.
The interim prime minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia needs to become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of Mali's population agreed on this point of view, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
As for the conflicting opinions in the poll, 29% of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.

Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Many people have verified the discovery using various devices and programs since the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Perhaps the meteorites were the source of water delivery to the earth along with organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists love to understand how planets formed, especially how the earth formed from the time when comets collided with the earth in the distant past.
Komo, 53 years old, began his rule at the beginning of this year and corrected the law project from last month that legalizes same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense".
He can run for presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration says will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of liters of jet fuel every year and reducing carbon emissions.
They use a technology associated with satellites instead of the old technology that used ground radar to allow air traffic controllers to determine the aircraft's location more accurately and provide pilots with more specific information.
There are no additional transportation means and the ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there are no additional car parks, car parking facilities, and transportation stations.
The fear of transportation shortages raised the possibility that the meeting would be held without an audience.
A study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" mentioned the discovery of a new species of birds in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in America and Uppsala University in Sweden said that the development of new species accelerates the evolution process - although they believed that this process would take much longer - due to interbreeding between the settled Darwin's finch, the migratory cactus finch, and the past ground finch with a large beak.
Gold can be shaped into a lot of different forms. It can even be turned into small shapes.
They can be pulled on a thin thread that wraps and tangles. They can be tapped or wrapped in the shape of leaves.
You can make it very thin, and stick it on another metal. It can be so thin that it was used for hours to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
The pH of a chemical substance is determined, and an indicator for this number is made using red cabbage juice.
The color of red cabbage juice changes according to the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substance.
The pH level is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical substance you want to test.
Hydrogen ions are protons lacking electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the dry powders together and squeeze them with wet clean hands until it forms a ball.
The moisture on your hands interacts with the outer layers, giving you a strange sensation and forming a kind of cover.
The cities of Haraba and Mohenjo-Daro had a toilet with a drainage system in each house connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the houses of the towns of Minoan in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were public bathrooms in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, bathrooms were often a part of public bathhouses that both men and women used together.
How do you communicate with someone thousands of miles away? You use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back instantly.
The satellite is sent to space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and visibility.
The matter requires a giant rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The invention of the wheel has changed the world in an amazing way; but the availability of an easier and faster means of transportation remains the most important contribution to us.
The train brought us, and the car, and a lot of other means of transportation.
Below them are other average-sized cats that feed on prey of medium size, such as rabbits, gazelles, and deer.
There are a lot of small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds, which are more numerous than them.
Their success secret is the concept of hierarchy, with each cat having a specific role that prevents them from competing with others.
The black cats are the most social and live in large groups called colonies.
The lion family consists of one male and three adult males, along with females and cubs that bring their total number to thirty.
Usually, females are closer to each other, as they come from a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion pack behaves like the wolf or dog pack, and the surprising thing is that these animals resemble the lion (but not the other big cats) in behavior and hunt their prey.
The tiger can climb (even if not very well), swim long distances and jump long distances, and their abdominals are five times stronger than a human's.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. The four of them are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full sound of the lion, but it is closer to shouting with angry words.
The dwarf leopard likes to eat small animals, and it hunts monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds when it gets the chance. And most of the animals that the dwarf leopard hunts are smaller than it.
Scientists believe that Abyssinian cats track and hunt animals by their sense of smell; they can smell them from even far away on the ground.
You can see well in the dark with night vision, and move silently. The leopard hunts its prey to hide around them and pounce on them.
How do we separate a small group of living organisms (a small population) from the main population they belong to (for example, if they crossed a mountain range or river, or moved to a new island, they cannot easily return from it), they mostly adapt to a different environment than the one they were in before.
Due to the new environment containing different resources and competitors, the newly formed group needs different attributes or adaptive methods in order to become a stronger competitor compared to its previous needs for strength.
There has never been any change to the original inhabitants, and they still need the same adaptation methods as we have taught them.
At the time when new residents start adjusting to their new environment, their similarities with the other residents gradually decrease.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups are different to the point that we can't say they are of the same type.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is considered an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants produce their food from sunlight through the process of photosynthesis. Cut back on shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is from plants too. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The Tyrannosaurus Rex was the dominant predator in its era, that's why it wasn't afraid of anything, except for other Tyrannosaurus Rexes.
The long fangs that he had were studded with more than 70 teeth resembling blades along with another set on the roof of the mouth, which means there is nothing that can stand in his way and escape from him.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, whales, and other large reptiles, so he may have been a carnivore.
And Zada attacked everything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex could escape her.
Despite the fact that most of the dishes we know, the Romans have their share of exotic or unusual holiday elements, such as wild boars, peacocks, chameleons, and a type of rodent called "zaghba."
There was another difference, which is that, at the time when the poor and women were eating their food sitting on benches, the rich men used to enjoy feasts together and they used to recline while eating.
Old Roman meals did not include the foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have pasta, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and the ancient Romans didn't eat chocolate.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods and it was considered the house of the god.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests used to serve the gods in the celebrations and the holidays.
Every temple has an open courtyard that leads to a secure sanctuary where only priests are allowed to enter.
Unique pyramid-shaped clock towers, called "Zaouara", are part of the temples.
The summit of the tower was a safe haven for the god.
In the warm Middle Eastern climate, the house did not have much importance.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was outdoors.
The women used to socialize in the courtyard of the house, the shops were just small shops facing the street. And they used stone to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, that's why wood was expensive.
Humans settled in Greenland separately. Norse sagas tell the story of how Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland on a murder charge, and how he travelled westward, finding a land and naming it Greenland.
Regardless of their discovery, the Eskimo tribes used to live in the past.
There were significant differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history in the countries of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, even though they were all Scandinavians.
If you watch the movie "The National Treasure," you might think that a treasure map was depicted on the back of the declaration of independence.
But this is not true. Despite there being something written on the back of the paper, it is not a treasure map.
The phrase "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text appears at the bottom of the paper, upside down.
Despite the fact that the author of this part of the text is not specifically known, we do know that the large manuscript (measuring 29¾ inches × 24½ inches) was stored folded at the beginning of its existence.
So, it is likely that the symbol was simply added as a label.
The landing operations on D-Day and the battles that followed led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was still not liberated at that time.
France was ruled by "Vichy". They are the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and served alongside the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and named the invasion "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans liberated the Free French forces in southern France, and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization is a common individual culture among a large group of people who live and work cooperatively with each other.
The origin of the word "civilization" is from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, and is related to the Latin word civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or state of the city. This defines the way of the social mass.
Autonomous cities are like the ancestors of nations. Cultural civilization means transferring knowledge through many generations and leaving a lasting cultural imprint, and spreading knowledge in a fair way.
Many small cultures are vanishing without leaving a real historical evidence and are not recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the revolutionary war, the Thirteen Colonies formed a weak central government, with the Congress operating under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have any authority to impose taxes, because there was no national executive and judicial power to rely on state authorities, which were often uncooperative, to impose all laws.
Zied did not have the authority to bypass tax laws and tariffs between states.
The materials required unanimous approval from all states before being amended, and the states mocked the central government to the point that their representatives were always absent.
The Italian national team, along with the German national team, are the second most successful teams in the world in football and were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, and the Italians used to compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands owned by Japan, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
Taiwan began its return in the 16th century and was named Formosa by the European sailors who passed by it, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to change the practices of original grain production and serve the Chinese workers on the rice and sugar farms.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War between 1894 and 1895, the Qing government corrected the Shimonoseki Treaty, through which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
The city of Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, which are Intihuatana, Temple of the Sun, and the House of the Three Windows.
Most of the existing buildings have been built on the edges of the complex to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
In 1976, thirty palm trees were restored from Machu Picchu beach and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the standard format for still image photography worldwide is 35 millimeters, which is the size of the dominant film at the end of the analogue film era.
Its production is still ongoing to this day, but more importantly, the image sensors in digital cameras have the same aspect ratio of width to height.
The 35mm model is actually a bit confusing, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this picture would be (how do we divide it by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
The aspect ratio of most common formats (such as the advanced photo system) is either equal to or closer to the width to height ratio.
The Trinity principle, which is often misused and ridiculed, constitutes a simple guiding principle that creates dynamism while maintaining a certain level of order in a clear manner.
The most influential place for the main topic is at the intersection of the lines that divide the picture into three vertically and horizontally (see the example).
The Catholic Church, which was rich and powerful, underwent scrutiny during this period of European history.
The Christian religion has connected European countries for more than a thousand years despite differences in language and customs.
The comprehensive power that he possessed affected everyone from the king to the general public.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds exist specifically for this reason.
The central authority was held by the church in Rome for over a thousand years. This concentration of power and money raised a lot of questions about the fulfillment of religious requirements.
Britain began to blockade Germany from the sea after the skirmishes began.
The strategy has proven its effectiveness; cutting off military and civilian vital supplies, although this blockade violates the international law in general, which has been documented and coordinated in several international agreements in the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sectors of the oceans, a move that even threatened neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the twenties of the past century, the prevailing position among most citizens and nations was that of peace and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war in the First World War, countries wanted to avoid this situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to work with Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of displaying different historical periods; each stage of China or each dynasty in power had its own distinct type.
Zied was among the ruling dynasties of an unstable era of divided provinces. The most famous period was the era of the three kingdoms that lasted for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During this period, a fierce war broke out between many nobles in order to take control of the throne.
The era of the three kingdoms was one of the most bloody eras in the history of ancient China, and thousands of people died in wars to seize the highest positions in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, the transition from dictatorship to a republican system, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just to the ruler alone.
After the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants and allowed those with more ambition to succeed more than others.
The same applies to the army because the classifications in the army are based on class, not based on skills.
The French Revolution inspired many of the oppressed working class in other countries to ignite their own revolutions.
Muhammad was interested, Yasser, in matters beyond the worldly life. He used to visit the cave and then it was called "Hira" on Mount "Nur" to contemplate.
The cave, which has remained throughout the ages, gives us a clear and vivid picture of the spiritual inclinations of Prophet Muhammad.
The cave is located on the top of a mountain in the northern region of Mecca, and it is secluded, away from the rest of the world.
In fact, it was not easy even if you knew it was there. And as soon as you entered the cave, you became completely isolated.
You can't see anything other than the beautiful clear sky above the mountains in the area. And you can neither hear nor see, only a few things from this world in the middle of the cave.
The Great Pyramid in Giza governorate is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands to this day.
The Egyptians built it in the 3rd century BC. The Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramids built in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "City of the Dead," in Egypt has many pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), as well as smaller tombs, temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "Up bow" sign resembles the letter V and the "Down bow" sign resembles a staple or square but without the bottom side.
The top sign means that you should start from the edges and draw the arc, while the bottom sign means that you should start from the end of the arc (meaning pull the bow with your hands) and release it.
The upper bow usually makes a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger.
Don't hesitate to draw your marks with a pencil, but don't forget that the crooked printed marks are there for a reason, that's why you should usually respect them.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their young children (Marie Thérèse, 11 years old, Louis Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, on October 6, 1789, found themselves forced to return from Versailles to Paris amidst a crowd of market women.
They returned to Paris with a lot of people yelling and protesting against the king and queen.
A group of fans succeeded in convincing the king and queen to visit their town's castle.
One member of the gang pointed at one of the killed royal guards in Versailles in front of the grieving queen.
The Filipino people are the ones who bear the expenses of America's imperialist war in the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonizer in order to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest on the bonds created in the name of the Filipino government on Wall Street.
"Of course, the huge profits coming from exploiting the Filipino people for a long time are the main gain for American imperialism."
We need to understand the context that led to the organization's presence, in order to grasp the knights of the temple.
The period in which these events occurred was called the High Middle Ages, which is a period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages came after the Early Middle Ages and before the Late Middle Ages, which all together roughly spanned around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from pushing technology or technological necessity to the strong sense that there is a fundamental logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology that controls the fate of humanity.
There are two common ideas in most interpretations of technological determinism: that technological development follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that this technology has "effects" on stable societies that are not linked to the society.
For example, there are some who say that the space engine will lead us to develop roads.
But establishing a network of roads throughout the country for just a few drivers does not bring economic returns, that's why developing new roads to reduce the cost of car ownership is necessary.
The collective ownership of cars increases the rate of road accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in healthcare to treat injured bodies.
Romance had a great influence on the cultural heritage that the writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel brought.
In the context of romantic movement, geography is what brought the people together, and with time the customs and culture related to that geography emerged. And those were, as they considered themselves, more interconnected with the place of the community, better than the laws imposed by force.
Paris is famous as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, and Constantinople was the fashion capital of medieval Europe.
It began to be renowned as a center of luxury in the year 400 AD and remained so until 1100 AD.
Its value fell in the 12th century due to the return of the Crusades and barely returned with its goods such as silk and spices, which had a higher value than what was available in the Byzantine markets.
At this time, Paris is named the fashion capital instead of Constantinople.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the tenth and thirteenth centuries.
In the beginning, the Byzantine culture had a significant influence in the East.
Despite this, due to the influence of Western media, the trends can be delayed by about 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at that time was the Crusades, and how people started using padlocks to secure their belongings.
The cultivation of subsistence farming is the type of farming that is carried out in order to produce enough food to sustain the farmer and his family.
Crop rotation, usually organic, is a simple system in which stored seeds suitable for the region's climate are used, with the use of rotation and other easy techniques to increase production.
Most of the farmers worked in the morning in subsistence farming, and this situation still exists in many developing countries.
The subcultures bring together individuals who think alike and feel neglected by societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished based on age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The attributes that determine the uniqueness of a subculture may be language, appearance, religion, politics, gender, geography, and a set of factors.
Members of subcultures demonstrate their membership through their clothing, behavior, and the language they speak.
Among the well-known methods used to highlight the importance of social upbringing, they rely on some extreme cases of young children who suffered when they were neglected, abused, or harmed by their caregivers, and who are not socially connected to adults when they grow up.
The little ones are often called "wild" or savage. Some people have imprisoned some of the lost little ones (usually their parents); in some cases, the neglect of the little ones was due to the parents' refusal to accept the child's significant mental and physical disabilities.
Wild children may be subjected to a disappointing treatment in their childhood, or to strong shocks before they are neglected or run away.
There are others who say they were raised by animals; and there are a few others who say they lived in the forest alone.
When raised by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits (within physical limits) behaviors that closely resemble those of a special care animal, such as fear of humans or not adjusting to them.
Although project-based learning is crucial to making the learning process easier and more important, support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning is not a method of learning, but rather a supportive way to provide support to individuals who are experiencing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is a form of interactive learning, as well as a paper clip in Microsoft Office.
The interactive learning is supported internally in the program with the aim of asking questions, providing motivation, and explaining procedures that the student may find difficult to deal with alone.
The children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from neglect and abuse to exploitation.
Children cannot grow up properly in an environment that lacks nurturing, care, and education, but they still grow up like this.
He knows that the alternative care system is a safe area for the little ones.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Alternative care must provide all the necessities that the children lacked in the homes they left.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and personal interaction.
The distinctive features of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage approaches and satisfaction methods.
For example, some suggest "learning" and "socialization" as important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were identified as new motivational aspects by Emory and McCord (1998) when studying audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting subtle facial expressions, which are facial movements that last for a few fractions of a second.
And they especially say that a person can discover if someone is lying by interpreting small expressions correctly.
Oliver Sachs pointed out in his paper that the president's speech indicates that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
Zied suggested the idea that these abilities in analyzing human behavior are shared with some animals, like pet dogs.
The research of the twentieth century showed the existence of two sets of Chinese varieties: one hidden and the other apparent.
The mutation increases new genetic variations, which are then selected from the pool of expressive variations.
The separation and reassembly make the contrast between the different groups with each generation random and not cohesive.
In the savannah, it is difficult for primates with a digestive system similar to humans to meet their requirements of amino acids from available plant resources.
Failure in this can lead to serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easily accessible plant resources in abundance are the proteins obtained from leaves and legumes, but these proteins are difficult for primates to digest if not cooked.
On the contrary, animal foods (ants, termites and eggs) are not easily digestible like him, but they provide high amounts of proteins and contain all the essential amino acids.
To take everything into consideration, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors' "protein problem" is solved in a way similar to how chimpanzees in the savanna do.
The interruption of sleep is the deliberate waking up during your natural sleep period and sleeping after a short period (from 10 to 60 minutes).
You can do this easily by using a gentle technique to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up all at once.
You found your soul wandering around in the hallway while you were sleeping, you can put it in the other room of the house, no need to get up from bed to quiet it down.
The other options include, based on biological systems, drinking plenty of fluids (especially water and tea, as one of the known diuretics) before going to bed, in order to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the greater the positivity that life gives. Everyone has the inherent ability to find peace and complete satisfaction.
People can all achieve enlightenment. The only thing that holds us back is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has expanded through the path of Mahayana for love and other techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of loving-kindness that embraces everyone.
Awaken the "kundalini" energy (enlightenment energy) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, singing, and visualizations, with "kundalini yoga".
The Tibetan meditation center is the yoga god. By imagining different gods, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany represented a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, but at the end of the war, conflicting systems, procedures, and cultures led to the conflict between the two countries.
After the war ended two years ago, former allies and enemies met and the cold war began.
The war was supposed to last for forty years ahead and the battle would be on the field, with proxy wars, in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, and in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense collapsed and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these old plans did not last long, as more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of cargo ships is the most efficient way to transport a lot of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditions dictate that the important mission of the navy is to ensure your country's ability to transport its people and goods, but at the same time, it is subject to your enemy's ability to transport his people and goods.
One of the most prominent examples is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II, where the Americans tried to disrupt people and goods in the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to counter this invasion using submarines.
If the allies had failed, Germany would have entered Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time in nearly 10,000 years in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for their easy availability of milk, wool, meat, and skins.
The goat herds were generally raised in herds that grazed in the hills and other grazing areas, and were often herded by goat herders who were mostly young or teenagers, like the usual known herder. These herding methods are still used to this day.
The maps were made in England in the 18th century.
Although the old train tracks were made of parallel planks, they allowed horses to run faster and shake less compared to the tracks that were considered very difficult at that time.
They invented iron for the train tracks a while ago to stabilize the tracks, but it appeared later that when they lay the iron above the tracks, it makes it more effective.
These are not the usual customs they follow, but the iron collects the scraps of falcons.
In the end, they replaced the wooden plow with an iron plow. In 1767, they used the first complete iron plows.
Walking was the first means of transportation, humans began walking upright millions of years ago, in conjunction with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk in a straight and steady manner.
They found footprints in the Australopithecus excavations from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, even though Sahelanthropus could have walked on its legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, and we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be proactive in reducing future suffering to some extent.
This is exactly how symptoms are treated in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and address them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot due to scientific and technological advancements for humanity, and problems have increased due to population growth and the luxurious nature of human life.
After being adopted by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft corrected by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the nearby John Dunlap printing press.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Denlab cash bulletins".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of them was sent to George Washington on the 6th of July, and he read it to his forces in New York on the 9th of July. A copy of it reached London on the 10th of August.
The Dunlap Broadsides represent the oldest surviving copies of the Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten version did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a single group of dinosaurs has survived and is still living today. We call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are still many things related to birds that are still being discovered, such as dinosaurs.
She has legs with outer protective layers and claws, and she lays eggs, and she walks on her two legs like a Tyrannosaurus.
All computers used today rely virtually on processing encrypted information in the form of binary numbers.
The value of a binary number can only be one of two values, which are 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers - or bits, if we use computer language terminology.
Internal poisoning may not show its symptoms immediately. Immediate diagnosis cannot be built until symptoms such as vomiting, which are common enough, appear.
The presence of mold, dampness, or toxic chemicals can be the best indicator of indoor poisoning.
Check the poster to learn the first aid instructions for specific venom.
Entomologists use the term "bed bug" to refer to this group of insects.
This word comes from the old term for bed bugs, which are insects that have adapted greatly to parasitizing humans.
Both "the assassin bug" and "the bed bug" are known for their long incubation period, and they adapt to living in a nest or the host's dwelling.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it one of the most widespread neurological diseases among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that the possibility of females contracting multiple sclerosis is twice as high as males.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest or their child's best interest to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to have a plan to adopt children.
In the process of adoption, the original parents terminate their parental rights so that other couples can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand the way the world operates through a scientific approach. This approach actually guides most scientific research.
Despite not being unique in this matter, experimentation and experience are considered a test that can be used to refute one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations further directs scientific research.
Nature and philosophy scholars focused on ancient texts, especially the Gospels in Latin language.
I accepted Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology.
In the time when knowledge was lost among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many physiological processes and behaviors are highly dependent on internal rhythms and their production is driven by biological clock.
I realized the periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are internal oscillators that communicate for periods of consecutive cycles in order to indicate whether there are external influences.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is a hereditary material.
Use Hershey and Chase experiments or viruses to introduce their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to label either the DNA using radioactive phosphorus or the protein using radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation and the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are somatic or germline cells.
Mutations can be passed on in germ cells to children, while mutations in other areas can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
The examples include activities that can be done on the site, such as fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting gardens, and studying information about the ecosystem.
Example visit, photography, and information gathering on this type of monkey (orangutan) in Borneo.
People from small towns go out reluctantly every morning to walk, work, and meet other servants in the square they have just left.
In this vibrant mode of transportation, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars.
The science indicates that this carbon-reliant mega-economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses transportation systems. Everyone complains about the transportation systems.
You rarely hear in advanced countries levels like this of complaints about the quality of water and the bridges that collapse.
Why do transportation systems continue to receive such complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are the transportation engineers not competent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic movement is the study of driver and individual vehicle movements between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic movement is difficult because you cannot predict the behavior of drivers 100%.
Luckily, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable pattern; that's why traffic flows in a reasonable manner, which can be expressed approximately as a sports pattern.
To better understand the flow of traffic, relationships were established between the three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
: Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape from enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are characterized by their ability to fold their wings along their body.
And this gives them a larger range of small places to hide from predatory animals.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings today are dragonflies and mayflies.
For thousands of years, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people think it's right, but many others believe the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
This seems logical, because you don't feel the earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It contains more water than eight times that of the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is the widest river on Earth, reaching a width of up to 9.66 kilometers in some places.
20% of the world's fresh water is poured from rivers into the oceans by the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and it collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of the pyramids in stone continued until the end of the ancient Egyptian kingdom, the pyramids in Giza surpass them in terms of size and architectural distinction.
They were amazed by the ancient ruins in the modern kingdom, which have been sitting for over a thousand years.
The population of the Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is the language of everyday life used by most workers in the country, while Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, and these elements can be found in nature in their original form and can be extracted relatively easily using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle assumed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements, which are earth, water, air, and fire.
This is similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, despite the assumption that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered minerals. And naturally, metals like silver and gold are also minerals.
You can get an ingot with small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe was created from matter. All materials are created from small particles called atoms.
The particles are so small that trillions of them can fit into the space of the point at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was a cherished friend to many people when it emerged.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing tools, the use of the pencil has decreased and its status has fallen.
People nowadays write their messages on their phones, hardly anyone uses the computer.
And the servant wonders what new thing will the calefiah become.
The nuclear bomb works by gathering energy to form a core filled with protons and neutrons.
Just like rolling a heavy ball up a hill. The nucleus splits again and releases some of that energy.
Some particles have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to break apart with a simple movement or change.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust. The lunar crust is called the Brecciated layer.
The plateau is approximately 70 kilometers wide on the near side and 100 kilometers wide on the far side.
The smallest offer is under Maria, and the widest offer is under the heights.
He may still have a lunar volcanic vent on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the magma to reach the surface.
Theories of content do not find something that excites or frustrates people.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and desires that emerge on their own to be fulfilled.
These theories investigate the need that makes some people love the things they do and the things in their surrounding environment that make them do certain things or not.
Both Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory are common theories in content management.
In general, it may appear that some behaviors start to emerge as managers lead their former colleagues, one of them is trying to remain like the others.
This type of managers face difficulties in making tough decisions,imposing disciplinary actions, conducting performance evaluations, defining responsibility, and holding people accountable.
From the other perspective, one becomes someone who no longer feels the need to change everything the team does and owns.
In the end, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior leads to many conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team members.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, with some subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team often serve as a point of contact for their physical immediate groups.
They mostly had greater independence than members of traditional teams, where their teams could come together according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a "shadow team" is described as a unique component of a virtual team (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p109).
Every member presents their reports to the "invisible team" management and the "invisible team" sets the standards for each member.
Why does a specific organization want to establish an educational organization that takes a long time? Innovation is one of the goals of applying foundational learning concepts.
To make effective use of all available resources on the path of administration in the organization, we can see creativity and ingenuity.
As a result of this phenomenon, we can create synergy within the organization to overcome obstacles and focus on implementing new innovative measures that meet the needs of everyone.
Before the organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the concept of continuity as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
The data related to neuroscience provides tangible evidence for the theoretical approach in knowledge-based research. This helps to narrow down the research area and make it more precise.
The support the connection between the science of brain diseases and the behavior of scientists in their research.
It is well known for a long time that different types of brain damage, shocks, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
New technologies allow us to see and explore the structure and processes of the brain in ways we haven't known before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Despite the fact that artificial intelligence has a strong connection to science fiction, it is actually a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
Research in artificial intelligence involves making machines to perform tasks that require intelligent behavior automatically.
The examples include control, planning, scheduling, and the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, in addition to recognizing handwriting, voice, and face.
These things have integrated fields focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now being used in the economy, medicine, engineering, and the military, in order to develop many applications on personal computers or video games.
Field trips are a big part of any department. Many times, the teacher likes to take her students for walks called "car walks" that are not planned by everyone.
Technology provides a solution through virtual field trips. Students can see the archaeological pieces in the museum and visit the whale tank, as well as enjoy the beautiful art while sitting with their classmates in the classroom.
Zied is organizing a virtual field trip as a great way to think about a specific trip and exchange experiences with other departments.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design their annual trip to the state capital, and they repeat this every year, but they save their previous reservations online to be like a registry.
As bloggers, they can collaborate to improve the students' battalion. At the time when students mostly start their experience in blogging with incorrect linguistic and spelling rules, having an audience in general changes them.
And since students are mostly the majority of the audience who criticizes, the one who writes in the blog starts to amend his writing in order not to be criticized.
"Blogs motivate students to become smarter in their film production. The goal is to attract the public's attention to inspire students to be talented and useful (Toto, 2004)"
Blogging is a tool that facilitates collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs can "enable students to become more capable of analysis and criticism; and with effective response to online content, students can determine their positions regarding what others write, and they can also form their opinions about specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada with its diverse languages and a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
We find Niagara Falls in the far south, and in the north, we find the beautiful nature house that is not exploited in Musquoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is known as Canadian necessity among rural people.
The large areas in the north are areas where there are few inhabitants and some of them are almost uninhabited.
For comparison purposes with the population census that is quite shocking: the number of African American residents in the United States is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa in the Indian Ocean are located off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island in the world and is an independent continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent countries, or connected to France, known for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country and spread it widely in the Comoros and Mayotte islands.
The European influence and colonization began in the fifteenth century, where the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a sea route from Europe to India.
From the north, the African coast borders the region, and it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean from the south and west.
Women: Regardless of their social status, women who are traveling must declare that they are married.
The dress is nice, but it's not worth the high price.
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment and that they are used to being looked at, grabbed by the arm, and more.
Stay tough in refusing men, and don't be afraid to stand strong in your opinion (don't let cultural differences be an accepted thing!).
The Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids used the city of Casablanca as a strategic port called "Anfa" after its establishment on the Barbary sailors' route in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it, naming it "Casa Branca", in order to escape from it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city and named it "Daro Al-Badiya", and the Spanish merchants called it "Casablanca" where they established trading bases.
Casablanca is considered one of the least popular places for shopping in Morocco.
It's easy to find stalls selling traditional Moroccan products in the entire old city, such as pottery, ceramics, leather goods, hookah, and all kinds of cheap goods, all of which are targeted for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the volcano Nyiragongo destroyed Goma and covered most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
Any visit to the outskirts of "Goum" must be thoroughly prepared to understand the ongoing war situation in the northern province of "Kefo", while "Goum" remains reasonably safe.
The city is a base for climbing the Niracongo volcano and some of the cheapest ways to track the mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can ride the "boda boda" (motorcycle serving as a taxi) to navigate around Goma city, and the usual fare (locally) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
In addition to being a bit difficult to reach, they use "Timbuktu" to refer to distant foreign lands.
The city of Timbuktu is known as a poor city, yet its reputation as a tourist attraction and the presence of an airport have increased.
In 1990, they added it to the list of endangered World Heritage sites, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops for Henry Louis Gates in the PBS series on the wonders of the African world.
The city greatly contrasts with the rest of the country's cities, as it is characterized by more of an Arab culture than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeast South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and bordered by the Crocodile River to the south.
The park's area covers 19500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each with its own wildlife.
One of the attractive features of South Africa is the national parks, including one of the main national parks in South Africa (South Africa National Parks).
There are daily fees for maintaining the park and entering it, just like all national parks in South Africa.
It may be useful for you to buy a Wild Card, as it will give you access to a selected group of South African nature reserves and national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong region its name and it is the place that is considered a popular tourist destination.
The structured buildings that depict the skyline of Hong Kong resemble a shiny graphic chart above the turbulent waters of Victoria Harbor.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and walk to the waterfront in Tsim Sha Tsui on the opposite side.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coastline.

Sundarbans is the largest coastal belt for coastal mangroves in the world, extending 80 kilometers (50 miles) in remote areas of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Indian part of the Sundarbans is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps; they also have some of the last remaining evidence of the dense jungles that once covered the now-plain of the Ganges river.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometers, roughly one third of which is covered by water/marshes.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and estimates say there are around 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The caravans from the internal station between regions (cutting the river) leave in the middle of the day, although most of them, especially livestock to the east and jacar / Boumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because of the long queues at the neighborhoods, it is better to buy groceries in advance, a few days before.
Most areas are served by the small Japanese Kiran "coaster", which is comfortable and strong.
The shared taxi is a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Barou (150 N) and Bounakhla (200 N).
The bridge of the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the tower is 83 meters, its length is 378 meters, and it has 3 tracks with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, and it was opened for circulation in March 2017.
"We have decided that the bridge will start operating at full capacity in September 2017, at the same time they are expected to complete the Brazilian customs points."
"The Guarani" was the most important indigenous group living in what is now known as Eastern Paraguay. The "Guarani" group lived by semi-nomadic hunting and subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting animals, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay emerged, previously known as "the great quarantine of the Indian islands" as a result of the confrontation between the Spanish colonizers and the indigenous population.
The Spanish began the colonial period that lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asuncion managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and fields in the world.

The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is pegged to the value of the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the island, located at Stanley in the other district of the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted in any place on the island and in the Stanley credit card, as well as the US dollar in many times.
On remote islands, they may not accept credit cards, even though they may accept British and American currency; make sure to confirm with the locals how to pay.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, that's why you need to exchange money before leaving the islands.
And since Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer will be winter in the middle of the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in semi-tropical areas; it is normal for temperatures to exceed 30 degrees Celsius in the summer months.
The winter can be very cold in the north: sometimes the temperatures can drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity work together to make the weather even colder than what the thermometer shows.
The amount of rain remains constant throughout the year, with certain seasons being "rainy" and others "dry".
Even though many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild life is ultimately wild and should not be disturbed or frightened.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how easy it may seem to tame them, bison, deer, moose, and bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors get injured every year because they do not keep a safe distance. These animals are big, wild, and considered dangerous, that's why they should be given their own space.
In addition to this, pay attention to the fact that the smells attract bears and other wild animals, so don't shake and don't leave any food smelling, and maintain the cleanliness of the camp.
