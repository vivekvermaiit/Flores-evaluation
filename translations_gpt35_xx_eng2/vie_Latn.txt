This not only confirms a hypothesis that many people know that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides detailed information that fossils cannot reveal, such as color or 3-dimensional structure.
Scientists believe that the fur of this species is brown hazelnut on the upper side and grayish green or yellow/orange underneath.
This discovery also brings a deep insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
"Because the feathers of dinosaurs do not have well-developed hair shafts called feather tubes, but have other characteristics of feathers - barbs and barbules - so researchers believe that the feather tube could be a later evolutionary development with these different characteristics."
The structure of the feathers suggests that this feather set is not used for flying but for controlling body temperature or for display. Researchers believe that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult plumage rather than down feathers.
Researchers believe that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the adult feather coat and not the feather of a chicken.

Candidates can send representatives to witness the entire process. In the evening, the votes will be counted by volunteers under close supervision, following a special procedure.

Uka's weapon malfunctioned when aiming at the head of the fifth man. Schneider is in pain, blind in one eye, missing part of his skull, and has to reconstruct his face with titan.
Schneider testified via a video connection from the USAF base in his hometown.
Apart from the Wednesday event, Carpanedo competed in 2 separate races in the Championship.
Her first race was Slalom, where she was marked Did Not Finish in the first run. 36 out of 116 participants in the race had the same result.
Her another race, in the Giant Slalom skiing competition, saw her finish in 10th place in the women's rankings with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than Australian athlete Claudia Loesch who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Hungarian athlete Gyöngyi Dani who finished 9th.
Four female snowboarders did not complete the race, and 45 out of 117 snowboarders in the Giant Slalom event did not place in the rankings.
Madhya Pradesh Police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have captured five perpetrators who raped a Swiss woman and recovered her phone and laptop."
The accused being prosecuted are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police commander Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver still survived despite suffering severe head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred is temporarily closed while emergency services have safely freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
At first, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Afterward, Adekoya was convicted at the Edinburgh County Court for the murder of her son.
She is currently being held in custody pending indictment and trial, but any evidence from witnesses may be invalidated because her image has been widely publicized.
This custom is very common in England but different in Scotland, where the law and courts have deemed that sharing images can cause prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that "journalists may be treading on dangerous ground when publicly sharing images, etc., of suspects."
The public prosecutor's office, responsible for overall initiation of prosecution, has informed journalists that there will be no comments at least until the indictment.
The file, according to the leak, will mention border conflicts, which Palestine wants to base on the border lines before the 1967 Middle East War.
The topics mentioned also include the future status of Jerusalem sacred to both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands the continued presence of the military in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed while the Palestinian government only agrees to the presence for five years.
Hunters in the supplementary disease control trial program have been closely supervised by forest rangers because the trial program has been monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.
As part of the collaboration agreement between NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been recruited through the staffing program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Director of the NPWS Conservation and Heritage Agency, the four shooters selected for the first culling operation have been extensively trained and instructed on safety principles.
Martelly took an oath in the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of nine members yesterday.
This is the fifth Interim Electoral Commission established by Martelly in four years.
Last month, the president's committee recommended the temporary resignation of the previous Electoral Council (CEP). This recommendation is part of a package of measures to transition to a new election cycle for the country.
This order is Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests since October.
The violent protests sometimes stem from failed elections, some of which should have taken place since 2011.
According to reports, there have been about 60 cases of overheating in handheld music players iPod, resulting in a total of six fires and causing four mild burn injuries.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry of Japan (METI) said they have been informed of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported to them an additional 34 overheating incidents that the company deemed "not serious."
In response to the announcement, this department called Apple's report postponement "extremely regrettable."
An earthquake occurred in Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT, Friday).
The North Marianas Emergency Management Office stated that there have been no reports of damage in this country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there are no signs of a tsunami appearing.
A former Philippine police officer has taken some tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking the bus they were on in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many hostages have been rescued and at least six people have been confirmed dead so far.
Just like the Filipino photographers, the six hostages including children and elderly have been released early.
The photographers later took the position of the elderly woman when she needed a restroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
He specialized in obstetrics and started working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
During his time working at the hospital, Liggins started investigating premature birth during his free time.
His research shows that if stimulated with a certain hormone, the lung growth rate of the fetus will be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators have recovered the two black boxes of the airplane on Wednesday.
The other animals also show gratitude for Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna is the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna has passed away on a night with two moons. As unique as she was. A strong woman."
Luna is just as scary as me...maybe even more so...I love her and will miss her...hope she's in a better place.
Among 1,400 people who participated in the pre-election survey before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said in the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
34 percent of the people in the survey share this opinion, they want Queen Elizabeth to be the last female monarch of Australia.
According to the survey, 29% of participants believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist is expected to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle swimming events and the 3x100m medley relay at the Prosperity Bloc Sports Festival, but according to his complaints, his physical condition is not guaranteed.
He cannot use medicine to relieve the pain because those medicines have been banned from use in the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper is a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, who discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Some people have verified the detection by various hardware and software in early February and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the Earth along with organic materials capable of forming various types of proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation process of planets, especially how the Earth was formed, as comets have collided with the Earth since ancient times.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began serving as governor at the beginning of this year. Last month, he signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called these rumors "political gossip and madness".
There were rumors that he would run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA has declared will allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of ground-based technology to allow for more precise aircraft positioning and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional facilities are deployed and ground vehicles will not stop at Wembley and there are no parking lots and transfer parking lots in the area.
Concerns about the lack of transportation facilities raise the possibility that the match will have to be played behind closed doors without the supporters of this team.
A study was published in the journal Science on Thursday about the formation of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
According to a report by researchers at Princeton University, USA and Uppsala University, Sweden, new species can evolve in just two generations, even though this process is expected to take much longer, due to the interbreeding between the Darwin's finches, Geospiza species, and the migratory Geospiza finches.
Gold can be processed into any shape. It can be crafted into very small objects.
It can be pulled into thin strands to twist and braid again. It can be beaten or rolled into sheets.
It can be thinly and thinly plated on other metals. It can be plated so thinly that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "sparkling sketches".
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can create an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage water changes according to the acidity or alkalinity (basicity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the experimental chemical.
Ion hydro is a proton that has lost an electron (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Twist two dry powder balls together, then squeeze them into a clean, wet ball by hand.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers to create a strange sensation and form a type of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a toilet connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women used them together.
When you call someone far away thousands of miles, you are using a satellite.
Satellites in space receive calls and then transmit them back down, almost instantly.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and images we observe.
We need a giant rocket over 100 feet tall to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an astonishing way. The greatest thing that the wheel has brought to our lives is making it much easier and faster for us to travel and transport.
It brings us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
At a lower level are medium-sized species of the cat family, which hunt medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cat species (including domestic cats) that eat small prey in large quantities such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a special job that each cat has to avoid competition with other cats.
Lions are the most social type of cats, they live in large groups called prides.
The herd consists of one to three adult males with related females and about thirty offspring.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other in a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion pack behaves like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals similar to lions in a surprising way (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very dangerous to prey.
Like an all-round athlete, a tiger can climb (although not very skillfully), swim, leap far, and pull with a force five times that of a strong person.
The tiger is in a group (called the Felidae) with lions, leopards, and cheetahs. These four cat families are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the roar of a lion, but more like a series of low growls in the throat.
Ocelots eat small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if possible. Most of the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that South American wildcats track and hunt prey by scent, breathing in the scent of the places where the prey has stood.
They can see clearly in the dark with their night vision ability and move stealthily, no one knows. Wild cats hunt prey by blending into the surrounding space, then pouncing on the prey.
When a small group of living organisms (small in number) separates from the main population (such as when they move across a mountain range or a river, or to a very distant island from their original location where they are unlikely to return), this group of organisms will often realize that they are in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitive rivals, so the new population will need different traits or abilities to become a stronger competitive contender than what they previously had.
The initial population remains unchanged, they still need to adapt as before.
Over time, as the new community begins to adapt to the new environment, they start to look less and less like other communities.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can't be called the same species.
We call this process the evolution of species, meaning the creation of new species. The evolution of species is a necessary and extremely important consequence for evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and they take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is breathing out).
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of our food is from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Love dragon is a top predator in its existence, so it fears nothing except other love dragons.
Its long jaw is equipped with over 70 sharp blade-like teeth and supplementary teeth in the mouth cavity, which means that nothing can escape its path.
We are not sure, but it may have a forked tongue. Its diet includes turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even be a carnivorous animal.
It also attacks everything in its path; even giant dinosaurs like T. rex are no match for it.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans shared some exotic or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent known as dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women sit on stools to eat, the rich prefer to organize parties together and recline to relax while eating.
The ancient Roman meals did not include food from the Americas or from Asia in the centuries that followed.
For example, they do not eat corn, tomatoes, potatoes, chocolate and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each god and considered it as the house of that god.
People will bring offerings to offer to the gods, and the monks will try to meet the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Every temple has an outside courtyard area and inside is the church that only priests are allowed to enter.
Sometimes the towers have a special pyramid shape, called ziggurat, built as part of the temples.
The tower peak is a special sanctuary for the deity.
With the warm climate of the Middle East, housing is not too important.
The Hebrew family has spent most of their time living in an open space.
Women cook in the courtyard; the new shops have their entrance facing the street. Stone is used for building houses.
There are no large forests in the Canaan region, so wood is very expensive here.
Greenland has a sparse population. The North European legend says that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder and while heading west, he found Greenland and named the land Greenland.
But no matter how his exploration went, the Eskimo tribes were living there at that time.
Although they are all 'Scandinavian' countries, there are still many differences in people, monarchy, customs, and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the National Treasure movie, you may think the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not correct. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the phrase "The original Declaration of Independence was written on July 4, 1776". This phrase appears at the very bottom of the text, upside down.
Although no one is certain about the author of the document, it is known that in the early days, the document written on this large goat skin (29¾ inches long and 24½ inches wide) was rolled up for preservation.
So, the possibility of adding annotations is simply a matter of labeling.
The Allied military invasion and subsequent battles liberated the north of the country from France, but the south has still not been freed.
This area was ruled by the "Vichy" French government. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invading forces instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched "Operation Dragoon" to invade southern France.
Within just two weeks, the US and French forces liberated South Vietnam from French control and then shifted their focus to Germany.
Civilization is a prominent culture shared by a large group of people living and working together as a society.
The word "civilization" originates from the Latin word "civilis", meaning related to citizens, and "civitas", meaning city or state, and it also partly defines the scale of society.
The city-state is the predecessor of nations. The culture of civilization carries the transmission of knowledge through many generations, a cultural imprint that still remains and is widely spread.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving behind substantial historical evidence and are not recognized as distinct civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, initially, thirteen states established a loose central government - with only Congress as the sole component - in accordance with the Articles of Confederation.
The National Assembly has no power to impose taxes, and because there is no national executive or judicial body, they must rely on the jurisdiction of the states, which often do not cooperate, to enforce all decisions.
It also does not have the authority to amend customs tax laws or tax tables between states.
The rules need consensus from all states before making changes, and states should not underestimate the central government to the extent that state representatives are frequently absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second successful team in the world to become the champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
The popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and F1 racing.
"Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions with Italian athletes competing in international arenas and Olympic events."
With nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu island), Japan becomes the 7th largest island in the world!
With its cluster/group of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical terms.
Taiwan originated in the 15th century when European sailors sailed across and recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, starting to change the local people's traditional farming practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on their rice fields and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the army of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) gained control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan to be a province of the Qing Dynasty in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, which ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, and Japan ruled Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, which are Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex are renovated to help visitors have a clearer picture of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most popular still photography format in the world is 35mm, the prevalent film size before the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced to this day, but more importantly, the aspect ratio inherited from the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The actual 35mm format is 36mm wide and 24mm high, which is somewhat confusing.
Therefore, the aspect ratio for this format (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS format) are equivalent or approximately this aspect ratio.
The one-third rule is often mocked and abused as a simple guideline to create dynamism while still being used as a measure of the order of the picture.
According to this rule, the most effective position for the subject is the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, at this time, became wealthy and powerful, beginning to undergo scrutiny.
Over the past thousand years, Christianity has become a bond linking European countries, despite differences in language and customs.
Its comprehensive power has impacted everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the contributions to the church exist for that purpose.
The central authority of the church has been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to wonder if the aforementioned doctrine is being followed or not.
After the outbreak of hostilities, the United Kingdom immediately deployed its naval blockade against the German navy.
This strategy has proven to be effective by cutting off military and civilian supply lines, although this blockade has violated widely accepted international laws, as stipulated by many international agreements over the past two centuries.
He releases water mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire ocean area, posing a danger to neutral ships.
There is not much reaction to this strategy. Therefore, Germany also expects to receive similar reactions to its unlimited submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing view of most citizens and countries was towards the trend of peace and isolationism.
After witnessing the suffering and brutality of war through World War I, all countries wanted to avoid a repeat of that situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla arrived in the United States to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
"He came to America with only 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of introduction from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison."
Ancient China had a unique way of presenting different eras; each period of China or each dynasty held corresponding power with different reigns.
Next to that, between dynasties are periods of instability when the continent is divided. The most famous period is the Three Kingdoms period that lasted for 60 years between the Han and the Tấn dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars occurred between many battles between the nobles to seize the throne.
The Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying just to vie for the throne in the grand palace at Xianyang.
There are many political and social impacts such as the use of data systems, transition from a specialized dictatorship to a republic, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than any ruler.
After the Revolution, all careers opened up for men to seek employment, helping the most ambitious people to succeed.
This also holds true for the military because military rank is based on merit rather than rank.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed laborers in other countries to rise up in rebellion.
Muhammad deeply cares about issues beyond this worldly life. He often goes to a cave called "Hira‘" on Mount “Noor” (Light) for meditation.
The temple has stood the test of time, the Hira Cave preserves vivid images of the spiritual direction that Prophet Muhammad left behind.
Located on the top of one of the mountains in the north of Mecca, this cave is completely separate from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even when one knows that it exists. Once inside the cave, one is completely isolated.
There is nothing but the clear high sky, beautifully surrounded by the mountains. A small world known and heard from inside the caves.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders of the world still existing to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to commemorate the deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, has many pyramids (including the Great Pyramid, the largest pyramid), many smaller tombs, many temples and the Great Sphinx statue.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his queens and family members.
The "upward bow" mark looks like the letter V and the "downward bow" mark looks like a tack or a square missing a bottom edge.
Going up means you should start from the top of the paddle and push the paddle up, and going down means you should start from the handle (where your hand grips the paddle) and pull the paddle down.
Raising the bow usually creates a softer sound, while lowering the bow creates a louder and more decisive sound.
Feel free to mark, but remember that all the musical notations are printed with meaning, so please respect them.
On October 6, 1789, while at the Versailles palace, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette with their two young children (Marie Therese 11 years old and Louis-Charles 4 years old) and her sister - Madam Elizabeth were forced by a crowd of market women to return to Paris in fear.
They return to Paris on a horse carriage surrounded by a crowd yelling and threatening the King and Queen of France.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the carriage windows.
There was a person in the crowd who waved the head of a royal soldier killed at the Versailles castle in front of the terrified Queen.
The war expenses of the US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They are required to pay taxes to the US colonial government to cover the majority of expenses and bond interest floating under the guise of the Philippines government through banks on Wall Street.
Of course, the super profits obtained from exploiting the Filipino people for a long time have become the main source of income for American imperialism.
To understand the Order of the Temple, one must understand the context that drives its creation.
The period in which these events took place is often referred to as the Middle Ages, a period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The period of the Middle Ages, the Middle period, occurs after the Early Middle Ages and before the Late Middle Ages, conventionally ending around 1500.
The decision of technical determinism is a concept that encompasses many ideas in reality, from driving technology or coercing technology to the narrow meaning of human fate being controlled by an underlying logical system linked to scientific laws and manifested in technology.
Most explanations of technological determinism have two common ideas: the development of technology follows its own path, not influenced by culture and politics, and technology "impacts" societies rather than being conditioned by them.
For example, one might say that cars running on engines are essential to the development of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically feasible for some cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The fact that too many people own cars also leads to an increase in the number of traffic accidents, leading to the invention of new medical techniques in the healthcare industry to repair the injuries on the body.
Romanticism has a major cultural determinant, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes each individual and over time, customs and culture related to that area develop, and these combined with social status are still better than imposed authoritarian laws.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was once seen as the fashion capital of medieval Europe.
It is famous as the epicenter of luxury, starting from around 400 BC and lasting until about 1100 AD.
The status of this city declined in the 12th century, mostly because the Seljuk army exchanged the gifts they brought such as silk and valuable spices for more than what the Byzantine market provided.
At this time, the title of Fashion Capital has been transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak in the middle period from the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
At first, the costume heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, the western style may lag behind from 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. The result of the Crusades brought one of the most important developments at that time, which was people starting to use buttons.
Livelihood agriculture is a form of agriculture carried out solely to provide enough food for farmers and their families.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple system, usually only using organic fertilizers, using saved seeds of local plant varieties and rotating crops or other relatively simple techniques to maximize productivity.
In history, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this is still happening in many developing countries.
Culture of a group brings together individuals with similar ideas who feel abandoned by societal norms and helps them to obtain a sense of belonging.
Microcultures can differ due to age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The factors that determine the differences in regional cultures can be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or the combination of these factors.
Members of a cultural group often express their relationships through the use of distinctive styles and symbols such as fashion, manner of speaking, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite some unfortunate cases of children related to neglect, unhappiness, or intentional abuse, lack of social interaction from caregivers as children grow up.
Children like that are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been kept captive (often by their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of these children is due to their parents rejecting children with severe mental or physical disabilities.
Children who roam may have already been subjected to cruel abuse or psychological trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some are considered to be domesticated animals; some are considered to have to live alone in the wild environment.
When nurtured entirely by non-human animals, wild children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost identical to the animal that cared for them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, the Scaffolding education method surpasses it.
Modeling is not a learning method but a means to help those who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Lesson plans can be in real or virtual form, in other words, teachers themselves are a form of lesson plans but as a small virtual assistant in Microsoft Office.
The virtual Scaffolds method is built into the software and aims to ask questions, remind, and explain processes that may challenge students to solve problems on their own.
Children are placed in the foster care system for many reasons, from neglect to abuse or even abduction.
No child deserves to grow up in an environment that is not nurtured, cared for, and educated, which they are currently experiencing.
We see the Care System is a safe place for these children.
Our nurturing care system needs to provide a safe shelter, dedicated caregivers, stable educational environment, and reliable medical care.
The shelter is considered as a place providing the necessities that their previous home did not meet.
The Internet combines elements of both community communication and personal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to many new aspects of usage and approaches to satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivators for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The degree of self-connection and continuous correlation are also considered as new driving forces according to Eighmey and McCord (1998) as they investigate the reader's reactions to electronic web pages.
The use of video cameras has brought about important discoveries in interpreting fleeting expressions, which are movements that occur in just a few milliseconds on the face.
Specifically, it is believed that a person can detect when someone is lying by accurately interpreting very small cues.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks points out how those who cannot understand the speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess its authenticity.
Even he believes that these abilities in interpreting human behavior may also appear in other animal species, such as pet dogs.
20th century research has proven that there are two genetic mutation groups: recessive and dominant.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation and the selection eliminates it from the group of expressed variations.
The separation and recombination occur alternately between two groups in each generation.
In the wilderness, it is difficult for a herbivorous animal with a digestive system similar to humans to satisfy the demand for essential amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, failure to do so will lead to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The fastest accessible plant sources of protein are likely to be found in leaves and leguminous plants, but they are difficult for creatures like us to digest unless they are thoroughly cooked.
On the contrary, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest but also provides a rich source of protein containing all essential amino acids.
After considering everything, we should not be surprised if our ancestors have solved the "protein problem" in a similar way to the wild animals on the grasslands today.
Intervening in sleep is the process of deliberately waking someone during their normal sleep and then falling asleep again a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a nearly silent alarm clock to help you wake up without being fully awakened.
If you find yourself often hitting the snooze button, you can place the alarm clock in a different corner of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Choices based on biological rhythm include drinking plenty of water (specifically such as filtered water or tea, which are known as diuretics) before bedtime will make you wake up to urinate.
Inner peace is inversely proportional to the stress that the body and mind have to endure.
The more tension is reduced, the more positive energy exists. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders us on this path is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but expanded by the Mahayana Buddhist path and many Indian Yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of unconditional love.
According to Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan Buddhism is Deity Yoga. Through visualizing the forms of various deities, clean energy channels, chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is produced.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. By the end of World War II, conflict over systems, processes, and culture caused these countries to become divided again.
In the two years following the end of the war, former allies became enemies again and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and will be fought in earnest by committed armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defense line was broken and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans collapsed virtually overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army troops marched in and created the frontiers of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Treaty of Non-Aggression between the USSR and Poland, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using boats to transport goods is the most efficient way at the moment to transport large quantities of people and goods across the sea.
The traditional mission of the navy force is to ensure the maintenance of the country's ability to transport people and goods, as well as to intervene in the enemy's movement of people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The United States attempted to transport supplies and troops along the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy also used U-boats to try to disrupt this transportation flow.
If the Allies had failed, it is possible that Germany would have been able to conquer England after defeating the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountain range in Iran.
The ancient culture and tribe began to keep these animals for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Goats are usually raised in herds to forage on the hills or other grazing areas, mainly led by children or adolescents, similar to sheep herding. The traditional method of herding livestock in groups is still used today.
The horse-drawn carriage road was built in England in the early 16th century.
Although horse roads only consist of parallel wooden planks, they allow horses to pull at a faster speed and carry heavier loads compared to traveling on everyday rough roads.
Thanh giằng được biết đến khá sớm để giữ các ray tại vị trí, Tuy nhiên, dần dần người ta nhận ra các đường ray này sẽ làm việc hiệu quả hơn nếu có miếng kim loại nhỏ phần đầu. The tie bar is known quite early to keep the rails in place, However, gradually people realize that these rails will work more effectively if there is a small piece of metal at the end.
This has become a common practice, however, the iron has made the horse wheels more prone to damage.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron railway was introduced.
The first known form of transportation is walking, humans began walking two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright human).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus apes, did not walk upright.
The characteristics of bipedalism are found in the Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start living more eco-friendly, we can get involved in environmental movements, and we can also become environmental activists to reduce the burden for the future to some extent.
This is similar to treating symptoms in many cases of illness. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we need to find the root cause of the problem and how to disable it.
Clearly, the world has changed too much due to human achievements in science and technology, and the issues have become more serious due to overpopulation and human's excessive lifestyle.
After being approved by the National Assembly on July 4, the handwritten draft signed by President of the National Assembly John Hancock and Minister Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop located a few buildings away.
Approximately 150 to 200 copies were produced overnight, now known as the "Dunlap Print."
The first reading of this document was by John Nixon at Independence Hall on July 8th.
A copy was sent to London on August 10th.
25 Dunlap sheets are believed to still be the oldest surviving copies of this document. The original handwritten copies no longer exist.
Many modern biologists believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that have survived and still exist to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don't think this creature is a dinosaur because they have feathers and can fly.
However, birds still have many similarities with dinosaurs.
Their feet have scales and claws. They lay eggs and move on two hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost every computer we are using today is based on the transformation of encoded information into binary form.
Binary numbers can only carry one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers - or "bit", used in computer language.
Poisoning inside may not have clear symptoms immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are often not enough to make an immediate diagnosis.
The most obvious sign of internal organ poisoning is the presence of an open container of toxic medication or household chemical.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for specific toxins.
Entomologists use the term "beetle" to formally refer to this group of insects.
This term originates from ancient familiarity with the Bed Bug, an insect species with a high ability to adapt to parasitize humans.
Both ticks and bed bugs are species that leave their nests late, adapting to live in nests or on the host.
Across the United States, there are currently about 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This number has made MS become a leading neurological disorder among young and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis affects the central nervous system, formed by the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research found that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis compared to men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of the child.
These couples have decided to make a plan to adopt a child.
In the agreement for adoption, the birth parents terminate their rights so that another couple can raise their child.
The main goal of science is to find out the ways in which the world operates through scientific methods. This method has actually guided most scientific research.
However, not only experiments and practical experiments are experiments used to eliminate one or more hypotheses that may be raised, asking questions and making observations also contribute to scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focus on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Acceptance is Aristotle's view on all issues related to science, including psychology.
When the knowledge about Greece declined, the West realized that it was cut off from the philosophical and scientific origins of Greece.
Many observed rhythms in psychology and behavior often depend heavily on the presence of internal cycles and the generation of these rhythms through the biological clock.
The circadian rhythm, not only simply responding to external circadian signals, has been observed in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillation system and will continue to run on its own free cycle even when there is no external influence.
Hershey and Chase's experiment is one of the compelling pieces of evidence showing that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacterial cells, or viruses, to introduce their own DNA into the bacteria.
They have conducted two experiments to label the DNA chain inside bacterial cells with a radioactive phosphorus compound or the bacterial cell's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Gene mutation can cause various impacts depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected gene segment, and whether the affected cells belong to stem cells or not.
Only mutations in the germ line cells of bacteria can be inherited by offspring, while mutations in other locations can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts tourists who enjoy visiting natural areas to immerse themselves in the beautiful landscapes, various plants, and wild animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and researching information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, taking photos and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, everyone drives out of the small towns to go to work and pass by others who are coming to the very place they just left to work.
In the system of transporting dynamical drones, everyone is connected to and supports a system of transportation by private car.
Nowadays, science believes that this massive carbon economy has pushed the atmosphere out of its stable state, which has helped human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about these transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or bridge collapse.
Why does the transportation system cause complaints, why do they make frequent mistakes? Are the transportation engineers not competent enough? Or is there any more fundamental reason happening?
Traffic flow is the study of individual drivers' movements and of vehicles between two points, as well as how they interact with each other.
Alas, it is very difficult to study traffic flow because it is impossible to predict one hundred percent of the drivers' behaviors.
Drivers are fortunate to tend to behave within appropriate limits; therefore, traffic flows tend to be consistent in a rational and mathematically describable way.
To simulate traffic flow more clearly, the relationship between three main features has been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help establish plans, designs, and operations of road facilities.
Insects are the first animals to fly into the air. The ability to fly helps them to escape enemies more easily and to search for food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
Thanks to that, they can hide in small places to escape from predators.
Nowadays, the only types of insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people think he is right but many people believe the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
This seems reasonable, because we do not feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest river and the second longest on Earth. It carries a water volume 8 times that of the second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river on earth, at times it can be as wide as six miles.
20% of the water from the rivers on this planet flows into the ocean originates from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3980 miles) long. It draws water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the pyramids by stones continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramid complex could never surpass their size and perfect construction techniques.
Ancient Egyptians in the time of the New Kingdom were amazed by the works of their ancestors that still stood a thousand years later.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and has the least population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legal and official communication.
Italian is used as a daily language by people working in the state, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of the Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Humanity has known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these elements can be found in nature in their pure form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
Philosopher Aristotle proposed the hypothesis that all things are created from the combination of one or more of four elements. They are earth, water, air, and fire.
This is like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he hypothesized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Basically, an alloy is a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
The elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like gold and silver.
You can also have alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of very tiny particles called atoms.
The tiny atoms are so small that thousands of billions of them could fit into just the size of a period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, from the early days of its existence, the pencil has become a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, when new writing methods appear, the pencil is gradually losing its place and is being used less and less.
Nowadays, people write messages on the computer screen, never having to sharpen pencils again.
One can only wonder what the fate of the keyboard will be when something newer emerges.
The bomb functions on the principle of using energy to combine atomic nuclei with multiple protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy load up a hill. Divide the work, and then release some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no impact.
The surface of the Moon is formed by rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the left side and about 100 kilometers on the hidden side of the Moon.
It is thinner under the sea (maria) and thicker in the highlands.
There may be multiple drainage basins on the adjacent slope because the crust is thinner. Magma is more likely to rise to the surface.
The content theories focus on finding what captures people's attention or attracts them.
These theories suggest that individuals have certain needs and/or desires that are acquired from external sources as they mature.
These theories consider what drives some people to be able to do things they want and what factors in the living environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theoretical concepts are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor theory.
In general, there are two approaches that may appear when a manager begins to lead former colleagues. The first approach is to try to maintain a friendly relationship.
This type of manager faces difficulties in making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and keeping everyone working responsibly.
Some people will transform into a completely different person and feel like they have to change everything that the whole group is doing and do it on their own.
After all, the leader must take absolute responsibility for the success and failure of the team.
This action sometimes leads to cracks in the relationship between the leadership and others in the team.
Remote teams must meet the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are still some small differences.
The virtual team members often take on the role as the point of contact for the actual team members to feel close to them.
They often have more self-discipline than ordinary members because their team may meet at different times, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of the "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a special component of the virtual team.
"The invisible team" is a management team where each member will report. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why does an organization have to go through the time-consuming process of establishing an educational institution? The goal is to bring organized learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and intelligence can be harnessed.
Therefore, the process of working together to overcome a certain obstacle can lead to new improvements to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can be creative, leaders need to create a culture of creativity as well as share knowledge and exploration of the entire group.
Angel (2006) explains that Continuous Improvement is a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Biological neuroscience data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to investigating cognition. Thus it narrows the scope of research and makes it much more precise.
The relationship between brain disorders and behavior patterns supports scientists in their research process.
For a long time, we have known that different types of brain injuries, trauma, disease, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some neurological functions.
The development of new technology allows us to observe and study brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and resources to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of the brain.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) has a very significant role in the field of science fiction, AI also shapes a very important branch in computer science, processing behaviors, capable of learning and sensitive and simulating intelligence in machines.
Research in artificial intelligence involves creating machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become their own rules, focusing on providing solutions to practical issues in life.
Nowadays, AI (artificial intelligence) systems are commonly used in the fields of economics, healthcare, engineering, and military, as well as in many consumer computer applications and electronic gaming software.
The field trip is an important part of the classroom. The teacher often takes students to places where taking the bus is not an option.
Technology provides solutions through virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, explore aquariums, or admire beautiful artwork while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing the camping trip online is also a great way to relive the experience and share the experience with future students.
For example, every year students at Bennett University in North Carolina will design a website about their trip to the state capital. Each year this website is redesigned, however the old versions are still maintained online as a keepsake.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing abilities. When starting to write a blog, these students often make grammatical and spelling errors due to carelessness, the presence of a general audience changes that.
Students are often the most critical critics so the blogger author starts trying to improve the quality of the posts to avoid criticism.
At the same time, writing a blog "requires students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The essential need to nurture audience interest inspires students to become smarter and more interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blog is a tool to stimulate collaboration and encourage students to expand their learning beyond the traditional classroom setting.
The use of appropriate blog sites "can help students become more sensitive to analytical and logical abilities; through positive reactions to Internet materials, students can identify their roles in the context of others' writings as well as express their own opinions on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada, boasting a range of art galleries and museums displaying historical and modern artifacts of Canada.
Further south is Niagara Falls and further north is Muskoka with its pristine natural beauty and more.
All of these and thus spotlight Ontario's highlights as what outsiders see as the essence of Canada.
Areas further north are sparsely populated, and some areas are practically deserted with no inhabitants.
A population comparison may surprise many: African Americans in the US outnumber citizens in Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, near the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest area and the continent exclusive for wild animals.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries, or linked to France, and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the regions, and it spread widely in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
This area borders Sahei to the north, and borders the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: Female travelers should say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can also have an effect (only for those that don't look too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to a situation that they perceive as harassment and things like holding hands, arm in arm, etc. are very normal.
Show a decisive attitude when refusing, and do not hesitate to maintain your position (even if there are cultural differences, that does not turn wrong into right!)
Casablanca city was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenid people, called Anfa.
The Portuguese people destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, and only left it abandoned after the earthquake in 1755.
The kingdom of Morocco rebuilt this city similar to Daru l-Badya and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders, who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop throughout Morocco.
Around the old Medina area, it's easy to find traditional Moroccan shops selling items such as Tagine pots, pottery, leather goods, Shisha, and various knick-knacks, but they are only for tourists.
Goma is the tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was flattened by the Nyiragongo volcano. This volcanic eruption disaster buried most of the city, especially the downtown area.
Although Goma is still within the safe limits, every visit from outside the city still needs to be carefully researched to understand the current combat situation in the province of North Kivu.
This city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some cheapest Núi Gorilla monitoring equipment in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorbike taxi) to visit Goma. The (local) price is typically around 500 Congolese Francs for that short trip.
With its relatively inaccessible characteristics, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for remote and exotic lands.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a poor town, although its reputation attracts tourists and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites under threat due to desert sand encroachment.
That is one of the main stops in Henry Louis Gates' special TV program Wonders of the African World on PBS.
This city is completely different from other cities in the country because it has more of an Arab influence than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park has an area of over 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each zone being the habitat of a different wild animal species.
This is one of the main tourist attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Just like all South African National Parks, conservation activities take place daily and entry tickets must be purchased to enter the park.
It is also beneficial for someone to buy the Wild Card, as it can allow you access to either or all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is named after the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists consider the main attraction.
The parade of buildings makes the skyline of Hong Kong reminiscent of a sparkling bar chart, emphasized by the presence of water in Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head straight to the Kowloon waterfront across the river.
Most of the urban areas in Hong Kong are developed in the reclaimed land along the northern coastline.
This is the place that the British colonialists had taken as their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a very good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest tidal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The forest area within the territory of India is called Sundarbans National Park.
Not only are there mangrove swamps, these forests also encompass some remnants of the once majestic forests that once covered the Gangetic floodplain.
Sundarbans has an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is water/marshland.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and is currently estimated to have 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The bus departs from the inter-district bus station (along the river) and runs all day, although primarily, especially the buses to the East and Jakar/Bumthang will depart from 06:30 to 07:30.
Because inter-district buses often run out of seats, it is recommended to buy tickets several days in advance.
Most districts are served by the small Coaster buses from Japan, which are very comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing a taxi is a convenient and quick way to travel to nearby destinations like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. This bridge crosses the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l’Oyapock in French Guiana.
Two towers are 83 meters tall, 378 meters long, and have two 3.5-meter-wide lanes.
The height of the bridge is no less than 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011 but the bridge was not opened until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to officially operate in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs stations are completed, as planned.
Guaraní is the largest indigenous tribe living in the area which is now the Eastern region of Paraguay, with a life of hunting, gathering, and self-sufficient agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who live by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," was born after the clash between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish people initiated the three-century-long colonial period.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has tried to maintain its own characteristics and indigenous identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also take place here at different times of the year.
To find information about the tournament and ticket sales for polo, please visit the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) which is pegged at par with the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the island, located on Stanley Street across from FIC West store.
In general, the pound sterling will be accepted anywhere in the archipelago and, within the Stanley area, various credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British or American currency may be; check with the owner beforehand to see which payment method is accepted.
Almost impossible to change Falkland coins outside of the island, so exchange money before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, the summer here is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months, the temperature is usually above +30°C.
Winter can be cold in a way that is easily misunderstood: the temperature rarely drops to freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity creates a feeling of coldness beyond the temperature displayed on the thermometer.
There is no distinct "rainy" or "dry" season: the amount of rainfall throughout the year remains virtually unchanged.
Even though many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or provoked.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all wild animals!
No matter how gentle-looking they may be, wild buffalo, elk, moose, bears, and nearly all large animals can attack humans.
Every year dozens of tourists are injured because they do not maintain a safe distance. These animals are very large and wild and can be dangerous, so give them their own space.
In addition, pay attention to the scent that may attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking foods with strong scents and maintain cleanliness around the camping area.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and officially became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
This port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for a British aircraft carrier. Nearly 200 American and German sailors were killed.
During the independent struggle movement organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are so many beaches because Auckland is located between two harbors. The most famous beaches are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in North Harbour district) are located along the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of them are safe sandy beaches for swimming and most have shade from Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beach is located on the Waitemata Harbour in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family-friendly beaches that are sometimes crowded with many shops along the shoreline. It is a safe place to swim.
Local beer mainly is 'Number One', it's not a mixed type of beer, but it's easy to drink and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many types of French wine you need to have, but New Zealand and Australian wine may be less affected when being transported.
Local tap water is absolutely safe to drink, but bottled water is also very easy to find if you are concerned about this issue.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is unfamiliar. Short black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino is coffee covered with non-foamy cream, and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate varies according to Belgian standards. The fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
There are many tours to this coral reef all year round and getting injured from this coral reef is rare.
However, please follow the government's recommendations, obey all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish appear near the beaches and near the river mouths from October to April in the northern area of 1770. Occasionally, they can also be encountered outside of this time period.
Sharks do appear but rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not usually live in the ocean; their main habitat is the northern river mouths near Rockhampton.
Making a reservation in advance helps travelers feel assured that they will have a place to stay when they arrive.
Travel agencies often partner with specific hotels even though you can book alternative accommodations such as camping sites through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers, and sometimes even combined flight and hotel bookings.
They can also hold a spot for you if you need time to consider the job offer or handle other documents related to your destination (such as a visa).
However, any required requests or adjustments must not be sent directly to the hotel but must be processed first through the travel agency.
With some festivals, the majority of attendees decide to camp on the spot and most participants see it as an essential part of the experience.
If you want to stay close to the activity area, you need to arrive early to get a camping spot near the sound system.
Remember that even though the main stage music has turned off, there are still some areas of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas specifically for families with young children.
If crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, make sure to check your cabin, as icebreaking ships can create unbearable noise that not everyone can withstand.
The travel time of the Saint Petersburg train includes the time within the city. Passengers on the train are exempt from visa requirements (subject to terms and conditions).
Casinos often try to make customers spend as much time and money as possible. These places often have no windows and clocks, and the exit is also very difficult to find.
They often provide special foods, drinks, and entertainment to keep customers comfortable and to keep them staying.
Some gathering places have on-site alcohol service. However, being drunk reduces the ability to make judgments and all savvy gamblers understand the importance of keeping a clear head.
Anyone who wants to drive in mountainous areas or on steep roads needs to consider the possibility of snowfall, ice, or freezing temperatures.
The friction force on the icy and snow-covered road makes it impossible for you to drive as if driving on a regular asphalt road.
If there is a snowstorm, the snow falling in a short period of time is enough to trap you.
Vision can also be limited by falling snow, blowing snow, or condensation or ice forming on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow are a common phenomenon in many countries, and the transportation is hardly interrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the most attractive destination in Africa and a highlight for many tourists.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to overland travel to observe wildlife in Africa, particularly in the Savannah.
Some animals like elephants and giraffes often come close to vehicles, and with just ordinary tools, we can easily observe them.
Lions, leopards and cheetahs can sometimes be very elusive so to see them clearly, you should use binoculars.
The safari trek (also known as "jungle trekking", "mountain hiking", or "adventure hiking") includes mountain hiking, for a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to host two Summer Olympics, after hosting the 1964 Olympics.
If you book your flight and accommodations for 2020 before any announcement of postponement, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary. However, as of the end of March, most cancellation policies due to the corona virus do not allow extensions until July 2020 - the time of the planned Olympics.
Most event tickets are expected to be priced between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Wet clothes can be dried by ironing. Many hotels have an ironing board and iron available for loan, even if you don't see any in the room.
If there's no ironing board or if you don't like ironing, you can use a hairdryer if you have one.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in serious cases, can cause fire).
There are many ways to filter water, among which there are very effective ways to remove specific risks.
In some places, just boiling water for one minute is enough, while in other places, it needs to be boiled for a few minutes.
The effectiveness of different filters varies, so if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals that they have never seen in their hometown.
Harmful species can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worst cases, can cause allergies, spread toxins, or transmit infectious diseases.
In themselves, infectious diseases, or dangerous animals can cause injury or death by force, are generally not considered harmful species.
Shopping tax-free is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from value-added tax and consumption tax at certain locations.
