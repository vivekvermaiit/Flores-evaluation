This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as their color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that the wings of this animal were brown on top with a light or carrot color underneath.
The finding also provides information about the evolution of wings in birds.
Because the wings of the dinosaurs do not have a fully developed axis, called the spine, but have other wing features - quills and barbs - researchers concluded that the spine was likely a later evolutionary development relative to the other characteristics.
The structure of the wings indicates that they were not used for flying but for regulating temperature or display. Scientists argue that although this is a tail from a young dinosaur, the specimen reveals adult plumage and not juvenile down.
Researchers argue that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample indicates adult feathering and not juvenile.

Candidates can send representatives to observe each part of the process. Late in the afternoon, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, who follow specific procedures.

The Director of Public Prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, announced this morning the prosecution of Huhne and Pryce.
Houn resigned and will be replaced in the cabinet by MP Ent Davie. MP Norman Lamb is expected to take over the position of Minister of Business left vacant by Davie.
Hugh and Pryce are scheduled to appear at the Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16th.
The victims were Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old, who was the driver.
Edgar Vega suffered injuries to his hand and jaw, while Christopher Snyder ended up needing reconstructive surgery on his face.
Yiuka's weapon missed, as it was aimed at the head of a man. Schneider suffers constant pain, blindness in one eye, loss of part of the skull, and facial reconstruction with titanium.
Snyder testified via live link from a U.S. Air Force base in his homeland.
Apart from Wednesday's race, Karpanento competed in two individual races of the championship.
Her first event was Slalom, where she received a "Did Not Finish" on her first run. 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result in this race.
In the other race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's alpine skiing team with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Lösch who finished first and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dáni who finished ninth.
Four female skiers from the women's giant slalom category were unable to complete their runs, while 45 out of 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to classify in the race.
The police of Madia Prantes recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The deputy general inspector N.K. Aria stated: "We have captured five individuals who assaulted the Swiss woman and we have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are Bamba Kantzar, Bota Kantzar, Rampro Kantzar, Gazak Kantzar and Vishnu Kantzar.
The director of the police, Chandra Sekar Solanki, stated that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
Although 3 people were inside the house at the time of the car crash, no one was injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The accident closed the road temporarily, while the emergency services were extracting the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He then went to a doctor's office in Antwerp in Cambridge.
Anteckoya has been accused by the High Court of Edinburgh of the murder of her son.
He is under arrest with charges and pending trial, however any evidence from eye witnesses may have been influenced as his image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but in Scotland, the justice system operates differently and the courts have ruled that publishing photos can be potentially harmful.
The professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee states that "journalists seem to be walking a tightrope if they publish photos, etc. of suspects".
The prosecutor's office, which is generally responsible for prosecutions, has informed journalists that there will be no further comments at least until the indictment is announced.
According to the leaked information, the document will refer to the dispute over the borders that Palestine desires based on the borders before the Middle East war that took place in 1967.
According to information, among other topics covered was the future status of Jerusalem, which is a holy place for both states, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to allow this kind of presence only for five years.
The shooters in the supplementary test combat against harmful organisms would be under close supervision by the forest rangers, as the test would be controlled and its effectiveness judged.
In collaboration with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Shooting Federation of Australia (NSW), specialized volunteers were recruited as part of the shooting program of the Shooting Federation.
According to Mike O'Flynn, Chief of Maintenance and Heritage of the National Park Service, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received detailed instructions for safety and training.
Yesterday Marteli was sworn in at a new Provisional Electoral Council (PEC) consisting of nine members.
It is the fifth temporary electoral council of Marteli within four years.
Last month, a presidential committee proposed the resignation of the Temporary Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that started in October.
Some violent protests occurred due to the non-conduct of elections, some pending since 2011.
Based on official reports, there have been approximately 60 cases of iPod malfunction resulting in high temperature, causing six fire incidents and leaving four people with minor injuries from the fire.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it was aware of the 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling the delay of Apple's report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake hit the Mariana Islands at 07:19 am local time (09:19 pm Greenwich time Friday).
The office of emergency management of the Mariana Islands stated that there have been no reports of damage on their territory.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A Filipino who was a former policeman captured the visitors of Hong Kong by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of his country.
Rolando Mendoza fired aiming at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many hostages have been rescued and confirmed dead so far at least six.
Six of the hostages, along with the children and the elderly, were released early; the same goes for the photographers who came from the Philippines.
The photographers later replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the toilet. Mendoza was killed by gunfire.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a career in medicine.
She was trained and became a gynecologist, starting to work in 1959 at the state women's clinic in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins, in his free time, started researching premature birth.
According to his research, if a hormone was given, the fetal lung would mature.
Xinhua stated that government investigators on Wednesday located two flight data recorders, or "black boxes."
The teammates paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first winner of the Queen of Extreme competition. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Unique like herself. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as I am...maybe even more...I love her and I will miss her...I hope she is in a better place."
Out of the 1,400 people who participated in the survey before the 2010 federal elections, those opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent from 2008.
The acting prime minister Julia Gillard supported during the campaign for the federal elections of 2010 that she believed Australia should become a republic when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
34% of those who participated in the survey agreed with this idea because they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
As for the two extremes of the survey, 29% of the total respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic without a monarchy.
The gold medalist was expected to compete in the 100 meters and 200 meters freestyle swimming events and in three swimming relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition is being questioned due to his discomfort.
He couldn't get the medication he needed to relieve the pain, because they are prohibited by the Games.
Professor Curtis Cooper, a mathematics and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever found on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water transfer to Earth as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
The scientists hope to understand how the planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed, as comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, became governor at the beginning of the year, and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense".
It is speculated that he will run for presidency in 2016.
The Civil Aviation Authority claims that the next-generation air transport system would allow aircraft to conduct shorter routes, save gallons of fuel every year, and reduce carbon emissions.
The technology it uses is satellite-based - as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology - to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate an aircraft and provide more precise information to pilots.
No additional transfers will be made and the underground railways will not stop at Wembley. Car parking spaces and parking and transfer facilities are not available on the ground.
The fears of lack of transportation raise the possibility that the match may have to be held behind closed doors, without the team's fans.
A study shared on Thursday in Science talked about the existence of a new type of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from the University of Princeton in the United States and the University of Uppsala in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although the process is believed to have lasted much longer due to the reproduction between the endemic finch of Darwin of the Geospiza fortes genus and the migratory finch of the Geospiza conirostris genus.
Gold can be molded into all shapes. It can be formed into shapes of minimal size.
It can be shaped into thin wire form, and then bent and woven. It can be hammered or wrapped in sheets.
It can become very thin and stick to other metals. It can become so thin that sometimes it was used as decoration in handmade illustrated book images called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using juice from red cabbage.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) of the chemical substance being examined.
Hydrogen ions are protons that no longer have their electrons (as a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Rotate the two dry powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, press them to form a ball.
The moisture in your palms will react with the outer casings, creating a strange sensation and forming something like a peel.
The cities of Charapa and Mohentzo Daro had a toilet with a tank for each house, connected to an advanced sewage system.
Also, in Greece, in the residences of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, ruins of drainage systems have been found.
Toilets also appeared in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Toilets in Rome were often part of public baths, where people of all genders formed a mixed crowd.
When you call someone who is very far away, a satellite is used.
The satellite in space receives the call and then sends it back to Earth almost instantly.
The satellite was launched via a rocket. Experts have space telescopes because the atmosphere of our planet creates distortions in light and visibility.
A gigantic rocket over 100 feet high is required to send a satellite or a telescope into space.
The contribution of the wheel to the world is remarkable. The most important of all is the simplest and fastest movement.
Thanks to him, we have trains, cars, and many other transportation machines.
Below them are cats of medium size that are fed with prey of medium size, from hares to antelopes and deer.
In the end, there are many hunters, including domestic cats, that hunt a lot of small animals, rodents, reptiles, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of territory, a specific role that each cat has, which prevents competition between them.
Lions are the most social of all wild cat species, as they live in large groups called prides.
The herds consist of one to three adult males, who are related to each other, along with up to thirty females with their offspring.
Females usually have a close connection with each other as they make up a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave to a great degree like wolf or dog packs, animals which bear an astonishing resemblance to lions (but not to other large felids) in their behavior, and are also exceptionally deadly to their prey.
The tiger, as a complete athlete, can climb (not very well), swim, make huge leaps, and exert five times more force than a strong human to lift something.
The tiger belongs to the same category (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion, but rather resembles a phrase of angry, shrill words.
The ocelots prefer small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and even birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that hyenas track and find animals to feed (hunt) through their sense of smell, sniffing the ground to see where they are.
They see very well in the dark through night vision and move silently. Ocelots hunt their prey by adapting to their environment and then launching a sudden attack on their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return) they will often encounter a different environment than in the past.
This new environment has new resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adjustments in order to be a strong competitor compared to what was required in the past.
The indigenous inhabitants have not changed at all, the same adjustments need to be made as in the past.
As time goes by, the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, the similarity to the rest of the population is diminishing.
At some point, after thousands or perhaps millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., release through respiration).
Plants create their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
Our houses and clothes are made from plants. The majority of the foods we eat are plants. Without plants, the survival of animals would be impossible.
The Mosasaur was the top predator of its time, so nothing scared him except for other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws had over 70 sharp teeth like razor in combination with an additional row of teeth on the top of his mouth, indicating that there was no escape for anything passing through his path.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that he had a forked tongue. He fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and he may have been a cannibal.
He would attack anything that entered the water. Even the giant dinosaur, the Tyrannosaurus, would not be a match for him.
Although most of their foods were familiar to us, the Romans also had various exotic or unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
Another difference was that the poor and the women ate their food sitting on chairs, while the rich men preferred to eat at symposia where they could relax on their side while dining.
Meals in ancient Rome could not contain foods that reached Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, there was no corn, tomato, potato, or cocoa, while no ancient Roman had eaten turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
The world would offer sacrifices to the deities and the priesthood would seek to fulfill the desires of the deities by organizing rituals and celebrations.
In every temple there is an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests have access to.
Sometimes specific towers were built in pyramid shape called ziggurats, and they were part of the temples.
The top of the tower served as a special altar for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the roof was not so important.
The Jewish family spent most of its life in the countryside.
The women were cooking in the courtyard while the shops were open-fronted facing the street. The stone was used as a building material.
The land of Canaan did not have large forested areas, therefore wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian saga, it is mentioned that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, as he traveled westward, he found Greenland and gave it this name.
However, despite its discovery, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Even though each country was "Scandinavian", the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differed greatly.
If you have watched the movie "In Search of the Lost Treasure", you may believe that there is a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back side of the Declaration of Independence was written the following "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". This is inscribed below, in reverse.
Even though no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that from the beginning the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, the annotation may have been added simply as a remark.
The invasion of Normandy and the battles that followed liberated the French North, but the South remained unfree.
It was governed by the Vichy Government. It consisted of French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; this invasion was named Operation "Dragoon".
Within two weeks, the Americans and the forces of Free France had liberated southern France and next in line was Germany.
Culture is a unique tradition shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization (πολιτισμός) comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which in a way describes the size of the society.
The city-states are the ancestors of the states. A cultural culture involves the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, in a continuous cultural imprint and an exquisite dissemination.
Often, smaller cultures are lost without leaving behind relative historical elements and fail to be recognized as normal civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially created a weak central government - with Congress being the only component - based on the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and because there was no executive or judicial authority, it relied on uncooperative state authorities for the enforcement of all laws.
Furthermore, he had no authority to overlook the taxation legislation and tariffs between the states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, yet the states disregarded the government so much that often their representatives were absent.
The national soccer teams of Italy and Germany are the second most successful teams worldwide and were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 car races.
Winter sports are more popular in Northern countries, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic Games events.
In Japan there are almost 7,000 islands (the largest one is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, it is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective.
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan and initiated a transformation in the practices of producing indigenous crops, employing Chinese laborers in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern parts of Taiwan, making it an administrative region of their empire in 1885.
After losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1984-1985), the Qing Dynasty then signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, where Taiwan passed into the hands of the Japanese, until 1945.
The Machu Picchu consists of three main constructions, specifically the Intiwatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings in the complex have been built from scratch to give tourists a better idea of what their original appearance was like.
30% of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976 and its restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common form of still image photography is 35 mm worldwide, which was the dominant film size in the late analog film era.
It is produced to this day, but the most important thing is the proportion of dimensions inherited from the image sensor forms of the digital camera.
The 35 millimeter format is actually 36 millimeters wide, which is confusing, and 24 millimeters high.
The ratio of the dimensions of this arrangement (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest ratio of whole numbers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common shapes (the category of APS shapes, for example) are equal to or closely approximate these image ratios.
The law of three, which is often subject to abuse and ridicule, is a simple guiding principle that creates momentum while maintaining order to some extent in a situation.
It declares that the most effective point for the main issue is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which now possessed wealth and power, came under control.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has created strong bonds between European countries despite the differences in language and customs.
The ever-present power of his was influencing everyone, from kings to common mortals.
One of the main beliefs of Christianity is that wealth should be used for the relief of the poor and suffering, and the financial resources of the churches are specifically collected for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question the extent to which the doctrine was being implemented correctly.
Great Britain started to block Germany from the sea, immediately after the beginning of the attacks.
The strategy was effective as there were cuts in vital military and political supplies, although the said embargo violated the generally accepted international law codified by various international agreements of the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom placed mines in international waters in order to obstruct the movement of ships in all parts of the sea, even threatening neutral vessels.
Since there was limited reaction to this tactic, Germany expected the same for its unhindered submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was one of peace and isolation.
After witnessing the horror and brutality of war during World War I, the countries wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job at the Edison company.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of differentiating each distinct historical period. Each stage of China or each family in power constituted a separate dynasty.
Among every dynasty there was also an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was that of the Three Kingdoms, which prevailed for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those times, there was fierce war among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China's history, as thousands of people lost their lives fighting for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
The social and political consequences are numerous, including the use of the metric system, a shift from authoritarianism to democracy, patriotism, and the belief that the country does not belong to a single leader, but to the entire people.
Also, after the Revolution, professions were accessible to all men seeking employment, giving the opportunity for the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applied to the army, as instead of being ranked by category, they were now ranked by caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed individuals of the working classes in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in issues beyond this worldly life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light) for contemplation.
The same cave where he survived during his time, provides a very vivid image of Mowamed's spiritual inclination.
The cave is far from the world as it is located on the edge of a hill north of Mecca.
In reality, it is not easy at all for someone to find it even if they know of its existence. As soon as you enter the cave, you are in complete isolation.
Nothing is visible beyond the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very few things in this world are visible or can be heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, which was built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many great pyramid-shaped structures constructed in honor of the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" located in the Valley of the Kings of Egypt, has various pyramids (the largest of which is the pyramid of Khufu), some small tombs, several temples, and the famous Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, as well as the smaller tombs and temples, were built in honor of his wife and family members.
The mark indicating that the lever should be moved upwards looks like a V and the mark indicating the downward movement looks like a staple wire or a square without its bottom side.
Playing upwards means that you should start from the edge, pushing the bow, and playing downwards means that you should start from the frog (the point where your hand holds the bow) and pull it.
Playing the doxari upwards produces a softer sound, while playing downwards is stronger and more dynamic.
You are free to put your own marks, but keep in mind that the existing ones serve a musical function, so they often need to be taken into account.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (eleven-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, who had been terrorized, to return from Versailles to Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people yelling and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open wide the windows of their carriage.
At some point, a person from the crowd started shaking the head of a member of the royal guard who was killed at Versailles, in front of the terrified queen's eyes.
The expenses of the imperialistic war of the United States for the conquest of the Philippines were covered by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the USA to cover a large portion of the expenses and the interest of the bonds were incited on behalf of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Of course, the super profits that resulted from the long-term exploitation of the people of the Philippines were meant to be the main gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights, one must grasp the context that led to the formation of the order.
The period in which the events occurred is often referred to as the Late Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which, based on historical conditions, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes a variety of ideas in practice, from the promotion or imposition of technology, to the strict interpretation that the future of humanity is governed by an underlying logic directly connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two central ideas: that technology development follows a path largely separate from cultural and political influence, and that technology in turn "influences" societies of inherent character, rather than societies adapted to the present.
For example, someone might argue that cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a small number of vehicles, so new production methods are being developed aimed at reducing the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership system also leads to higher rates of traffic accidents, which in turn lead to new methods in healthcare for the rehabilitation of physical injuries.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Within the framework of Romanticism, geography shaped people and over time customs and cultural elements emerged in connection with this geography, which, being in harmony with the position of society, were better than the arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered a source of style in the modern era, so too Constantinople was the corresponding European source during the feudal period.
His reputation as the center of wealth began to spread around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its prestige diminished during the twelfth century, mainly due to the Crusaders who brought back materials such as silk and spices, which had higher value than the products of the Byzantine markets.
Then it was when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Istanbul to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as the 14th century.
In the beginning, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, the slow communication channels entailed delays of 25 to 30 years in the transmission of technology in the West.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time, which resulted from the Crusades, was that people started fastening their clothes with buttons.
The maintenance agriculture is the agriculture that takes place for the production of enough food to cover only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Survival agriculture is a simple, usually organic system using saved seeds from the local ecosystem, combined with crop rotations or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Traditionally, the majority of farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this still happens in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite people with similar views who feel marginalized by social standards, giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Cultural differences are divided based on the age of the member, their origin, social class, location, and/or racial discrimination.
The characteristics of a subculture that make it unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
In order to signify their identity, members of a subculture often adopt a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes various fashion trends, specific behaviors, and jargon.
The main technique for the meaning of socialization is to focus on the few unfortunate incidents of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or mistreatment, did not interact with adults during their lifetime.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some wild children have been isolated by humans, usually by their own parents. In some cases, this abandonment of the child was due to the rejection by the parents due to the serious mental or physical disability of the child.
Wild children are likely to have experienced serious abuse or traumatic experiences before they are abandoned or before they run away.
Some are said to have been raised by animals; for some, it is speculated that they have lived alone in the wild.
A wild child, when raised entirely by animals without any contact with humans, exhibits behaviors (within natural limits) that closely resemble those of the specific animal that raised it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While teaching based on work makes learning easier and more interesting, aids take it one step further.
The tutorials are not a way of learning but more of a helping hand for people undergoing a new teaching experience, such as learning a new computer program or starting a new project.
There are virtual and real interfaces, in other words, the teacher is a form of interface but the same applies to the Microsoft Office ribbon connector.
Virtual aids are integrated into the software and are intended to ask, promote, and explain processes that may be very difficult for students to handle.
Children are placed under the care of adoptive parents for various reasons ranging from neglect and abuse, even to blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment without care, love, and education, but it happens.
We perceive the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
The foster care system we have is considered to provide safe homes, caring individuals who offer support, consistent training, and reliable medical care.
Care from foster parents is supposed to provide all the needs that the child did not receive in the home from which they were removed.
The internet includes elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the internet result in the existence of additional dimensions in terms of approaching uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are considered important motivators for someone to use the internet (James et al., 1995).
The "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also defined as aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) during their research on the public's reactions to websites.
Video recording has helped in significant findings in understanding microscopic expressions, namely our expressions that hold minimal information.
Specifically, it is said that one can perceive if someone is lying by accurately interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks in his dissertation titled "The President's Speech" mentions that people who are unable to understand the speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately discern sincerity.
It is also considered that these abilities in understanding human behavior are presented in animals such as domestic dogs.
A survey of the twentieth century showed that there are two forms of genetic polymorphism, the latent and the expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variations and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
The distinction and the mixture redistribute the diversity between the two sides in each family.
Outside in the savannah, it is difficult for a primary mammal with a digestive system like the human one to satisfy its need for amino acids from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, their failure in this specific area had serious consequences: reduced growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins that can be incorporated into leaves and seeds, but they are difficult to be assimilated by primary mammals such as ourselves, unless cooked.
On the contrary, the insects (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also significant sources of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Calculating all the elements, it does not surprise us that our ancestors faced the "protein issue" as the chimpanzees do on the savannah at the moment.
Interrupted sleep is the process of consciously waking up during your normal sleep duration and then falling asleep again shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you can regain your senses without fully waking up.
If you find yourself hitting the snooze button when you are asleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you have to get up to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm include consuming plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties) before bedtime, so that no one is forced to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace an individual possesses is inversely proportional to the level of stress in their body and mind.
The lower the pressure, the greater the life force that is present. Each person has the ability to find the ultimate tranquility and satisfaction.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacles to this goal are the intensity and negativity of each one of us.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but expanded from the path of the love of machigian and from many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is, in principle, very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that embraces all.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (illuminating) awakens due to movements, breathing practices, mantras, and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through envisioning various deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, conflicts at the level of systems, processes, and culture led the two countries to rupture.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the beginning of the Cold War began.
He would hold for 40 years and would have combat clashes between representatives, at battle points from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other regions.
Until September 17th, 1939, Poland's defense had already been broken, and their only hope was to retreat and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans ceased to be useful almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine, after invading the eastern territories of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transportation of goods is by far the most efficient way for the overseas movement of large portions of the population and goods.
The work of sailors from ancient times aimed to ensure that your country can transport your own people and goods, while at the same time preventing your enemy from transporting their own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the campaign in the North Atlantic during World War II. The Americans were trying to transport men and supplies across to the other side of the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using submarines, was attempting to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies failed, the Germans would most likely be able to conquer Britain as they did with the rest of Europe.
The goats were domesticated for the first time in the Zagros Mountains of Iran 10,000 years ago.
Ancient civilizations and tribes start to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and leather.
The domestic goats generally were kept in herds that wandered on hills or other pasturelands, often watched over by goatherds who were usually children or adolescents, equivalent to the more widely known shepherds. These methods of breeding are still used in our days.
Wooden railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wooden railways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to achieve higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the few rough roads of the day.
The wooden rail joints appeared quite early and their purpose was to hold the railway tracks in place. However, it gradually became apparent that the tracks would be much more functional with an iron support at the top.
Something like this was a common method, but iron created more damage on the wheels of the wagons than wood.
Ultimately, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first railway lines made their appearance, consisting exclusively of iron.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, as people started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright as is customary.
The elements of bipedal movement have been found in fossils of australopithecines from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet even seven million years ago.
We have the ability to lead a more sustainable life, become part of the environmental movement, and perhaps act activist to somehow limit the problems of the future.
It's like treating symptoms in many cases. However, if we do not want a temporary treatment, we will need to discover the source of the issues and neutralize them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological achievements of humanity, and that the problems have increased due to overpopulation and wasteful lifestyle.
After its approval by Congress on July 4, the handwritten note signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing office.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were released, now known as the "Danlap Brochures".
The first public reading of the document was performed by John Nixon on July 8th in the outdoor space of the Independence Hall.
A copy was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. Another one arrived on August 10 in London.
The 25 brochures of Dunlap that we know still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript was not preserved.
Many paleontology scientists nowadays consider that a species of dinosaurs has survived to this day. They refer to birds.
Not many of them are classified in the category of dinosaurs because they have wings and the ability to fly.
However, many things in birds make them resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two legs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Computers now have as their basis the management of information that is encoded with a binary system.
To use computer terminology, a binary number can take only one or two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are quite general so an immediate diagnosis may not be possible.
The most accurate sign that someone has been internally poisoned is an open bottle of medication or some toxic household chemical substance in the area.
Read the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "chorus" is officially used by etymologists for this group of insects.
This term comes from the familiarization of the ancients with fleas, which were insects that easily adapted to parasitize humans.
The antlion and the scorpion are burrow-dwelling, adapted to live in their nest or burrow.
In the United States of America, there are around 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the main neurological disease among younger and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, of which the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve are parts.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis compared to men.
Two partners may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest or the best interest of the child they have.
These couples can design an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world operates through the scientific method. This method essentially guides most scientific research.
There is not only, however, experimentation, and specifically the experiment is a test conducted to refute one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and observation also guide scientific research.
Physiognomists and philosophers focused on classical texts and specifically on the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's positions on scientific issues, including psychology, enjoyed acceptance.
As Greek intellectual thought declined, the West became disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that the rhythms recorded in physiology and behavior often depend on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators, which continue their cyclic operation constantly even when they do not have external stimuli.
The experiment of Hersey and Chase was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
The Hersh and Chase took phages, or viruses, in order to put their genetic material into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they either labeled the DNA in the phagosome using radioactive phosphorus or the phagosome protein using radioactive sulfur.
Mutations may result in a wide variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, how important the role of the genetic material segment it affects is, and whether the affected cells are stem cells or somatic cells.
Only mutations in stem cells can be inherited by offspring, as mutations in other cells may cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are looking for natural landscapes to enjoy nature, along with the area's wild flora and fauna.
Examples of activities in a given location include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, as well as studying information related to the ecosystem.
For example, some visit, take photos, and learn about the Borneo orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small towns with their cars to go to their workplace and meet others, whose workplace destination is the place they just left.
In dynamic shuttle transportation, everyone is connected in some way and support a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Today, science shows that this huge economy of coal has taken the biosphere out of a stable state that has supported the evolution of the human species over the last two million years.
Every person participates in society and uses some transportation system. And almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries complaints about water quality or bridge collapse are rarely heard at the same level.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incapable? Or is there something more fundamental to blame?
The Traffic Flow is the analysis of the circulation of specific drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is not easy, as it is impossible to predict with certainty the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range of consistency; thus, traffic patterns tend to have some logical consistency and their mathematical representation can be approximated.
For the best representation of traffic intensity, relationships between the three main characteristics have been established: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships helped in the preparation, design, and operation of road network facilities.
The first animals that took off were the insects. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies backwards.
This provides them with a greater variety of small prey than predators.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Many years ago, Aristarchus reported that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some believed he was right, but many considered the opposite, that is, that the Solar System moved around the Earth and the Sun (even around other stars).
It seems logical, since the Earth does not appear to be moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest overall river on the planet. It carries over 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon also constitutes the river with the widest width worldwide, which sometimes reaches 6 miles.
20% of the water discharged by Earth's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 kilometers long (3,980 miles). It gathers water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the pyramids of Giza in size and technical skill in construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were impressed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The residents of Vatican City amount to about 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and has the smallest population.
The Vatican uses the Italian language in its legislation and official announcements.
The Italian language is also used in everyday life by most people working for the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
The man knew about the existence of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper from ancient times, as all these can be found in nature in unrefined form and their mining with primitive tools is relatively easy.
Philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is created from the combination of one or more of the four elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
Mainly appeared as the 4 forms of matter (in this sequence): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it was also assumed that they change into new substances in order for this presence to be formed.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that there are many chemical elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. There are of course other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of very small particles, called atoms.
The size of atoms is so exceptionally small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, when the pencil appeared, it became a good friend for many.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods emerge, the position and usefulness of the pencil have been downgraded.
The world now writes messages on computer screens, without ever needing to pick up a pencil.
Someone might wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The principle of the fission bomb is based on the idea that energy is required to form a core with many protons and neutrons.
It feels like a heavy cart is dragging up a hill. By splitting the nucleus again, part of this energy is released.
Some individuals have unstable cores, which can lead to their breakdown under little or no pressure.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
He is thinner under the seas and thicker under the plateaus.
There may be more seas on the nearby side, because the crust is thinner. The lava could better go up to the surface.
The theories of content focus on discovering what makes people click or what attracts them.
These theories argue that individuals have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
These theories study what makes certain people want what they want and what in their environment will lead them to do or not do specific things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers start to lead their former peers. The one end of the spectrum is to try to remain as "one of the kids" (or one of the).
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, to take disciplinary measures, to conduct evaluations, to delegate responsibilities, and to hold people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, one can transform into an unrecognizable person who feels the need to change everything the group has done and take ownership of it.
In the end, the one ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team is the leader.
This behavior often leads to a rift between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are created with the same principles of effectiveness as traditional teams, however there are small differences.
The virtual members of the team often act as a link to their physical team.
Often, they are more autonomous than the conventional team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones, which may not be acceptable to their local management.
The existence of an "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is another unique element of a virtual team.
Everyone is presented to the "invisible team" management. It sets the specifications for all participants.
Why would an organization want to go through this time-consuming process of establishing the learning of the organization's capabilities? One of the goals for the practical application of the concept of learning the organization's capabilities is innovation.
Creativity and intelligence are favored when all available resources are used appropriately in the operational departments of an organization.
As a result, the process by which an organization collaborates to overcome a barrier can lead to new innovative processes to serve the needs of the customer.
For an organization to be innovative, management must create an environment of innovation, knowledge exchange, and organizational learning.
The explanation given by Anghel (2006) for the approach of continuous learning describes it as a method used to help organizations to improve their performance level.
The neurobiological elements provide natural evidence for a theoretical study of cognition. Therefore, they limit the breadth of research, making it clearer.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is an aid for researchers and their study.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain injury, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and may cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that have never been seen before in the past.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to create simulation models that will help us understand the processes happening in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence largely refers to scientific imagination, it is, however, an important branch of computer science that deals with adapting behavior, learning, and intelligence to a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence includes the construction of machines with the purpose of automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
The examples include checking, programming, responding to diagnoses and customer inquiries, as well as handwriting recognition, voice recognition, and face recognition.
These now constitute distinct principles, which focus on providing solutions to real problems of everyday life.
The AI system operates in our days often in the fields of economy, healthcare, engineering, and armed forces, while it is also integrated into various applications of home computer software and cyber games.
Trips are an important element of every class. Very often a teacher would want to go with his students to places where access by bus is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual excursions. Students can see museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while in their classroom.
Basically, participating in a field trip, also provides a significant opportunity to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and it is renewed every year, but the old versions are kept online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also contribute to improving the student's writing style. While students' experience on blogs often starts with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to do his best to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
Also, participation in blogs "forces students to become more understandable about the world around them". The need to maintain the interest of the public inspires students to become smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Management of a website is a technique that promotes teamwork and encourages students to learn beyond what they traditionally learn in school in the morning.
The proper use of blogs "can encourage students to use more analytical and critical thinking, as through active response to internet material, students can define their positions within the framework of other people's texts, as well as express their own views on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the captivating, bilingual capital of Canada, which includes a wide range of art galleries and museums that showcase both the old and the contemporary Canada.
The Niagara Falls are located further south and to the north lies the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and even further.
All these and many more characterize Ontario as the quintessence of the Canadian character as perceived by foreigners.
Large areas in the even more northern part are quite sparsely populated, while some are almost uninhabited zones of wild nature.
Surprisingly, African Americans living in the USA outnumber Canadians.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and constitutes by itself a continent in terms of its wild fauna species.
Almost all the islands are independent or have French origins, and are famous for providing luxurious sea shelters.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region and this spread extensively to the Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonization began in the 15th century, when the explorer Vasco da Gama, who came from Portugal, discovered the route that circumnavigates the Cape and leads from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel, while the Atlantic surrounds it on the south and west side of the place.
Women: It is recommended for every woman traveling to declare herself as married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences in habits may lead to actions that are considered harassment, and it is rare for them to be followed, held by the hand, etc.
Be firm when rejecting a man and don't be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences or not, it's not an excuse!).
Casablanca, the modern city, was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and became a strategic port for the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids who gave it the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and gave it the name Daru I-Batigia, while the name Casablanca was given by Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the places that have the least interest for shopping in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places around the old Medina that sell traditional goods of Morocco, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of trinkets, but they are all touristy.
Goma is a city in the Democratic Republic of Congo with high tourist visitation in the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, the lava of which covered almost all the roads of the city, especially its center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside of Goma should be carefully considered to understand the ongoing conflict situation in the North Kivu province.
The city also serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheaper tracking and observing programs of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The (local) price is usually around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
"Combined with its relative inaccessibility, 'Timbuktu' has acquired the metaphorical sense of an exotic, distant country."
Today, Timbuktu is a dilapidated city, despite its reputation that makes it a tourist attraction, while it also has an airport.
The addition to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger took place in 1990, as it is threatened by desert sand.
It is one of the most important stations during Henry Louis Gates' broadcast on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) for the special Wonders of the African World.
The city differs completely from the other cities of the country, as it mainly has an Arabian atmosphere and not an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northern and eastern part of South Africa and is located on the border line of Mozambique in the eastern point, Zimbabwe in the northern point, while the Crocodile River is considered its southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different areas of ecological interest, each supporting different species of wildlife.
It is one of the most notable landmarks in South Africa and is referred to as the emblem of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all National Parks in South Africa, there are daily maintenance entrance tickets for the park.
Perhaps it is beneficial for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access either to selected parks in South Africa, or to all of its national parks.
The island of Hong Kong is also called the territory of Hong Kong and is a major attraction for many visitors.
The splendor of the buildings that shape the urban panorama of Hong Kong has been compared to a dazzling light beam, highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For a better view in Hong Kong, leave the island and head across to the Kowloon waterfront.
The urban development of Hong Kong Island is mostly stacked in high density on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the part that the British colonizers occupied and, therefore, if you are looking for clues of the colonial past of the area, it is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest zone in the world, stretching 80 km on the continental part of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just vast wetlands, they include some of the last pieces of the imposing jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which approximately one third is covered by water/marsh zones.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently around 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses depart from the intercity station (opposite the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east towards Jakarta / Bumtang, depart between 06:30 and 7:30.
Due to the fact that buses between regions are usually full, it is recommended to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster-type buses, which are characterized by their comfort and durability.
The shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paros (150 nautical miles) and Punakha (200 nautical miles).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It stretches over the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters, a length of 378 meters, and have two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011 and had closed the traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when it is expected that the Brazilian customs control points will have been completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited the lands that are now known as eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The area of Tsako hosted other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Paiagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called "Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the clash between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The period of colonization, which lasted for three centuries, began with the Spaniards.
From the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its domestic character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best water polo teams and players worldwide.
The main tournament takes place annually in the last month of the year at the water polo pools of Las Canitas.
Here you can watch smaller tournaments and matches in other times of the year.
For news regarding tournaments and ticket sales points for water polo matches, check the Polo Union of Argentina.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the value of which is equal to the value of the pound sterling (GBP).
You can exchange currency at the only bank of the islands, which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards as well as US dollars are usually accepted.
In remote islands, credit cards are likely not to be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; ask the owners in advance to find out which payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to convert Falkland currency outside the islands, so do the currency conversion before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone. In the summer, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
The cold in winter is deceptive: temperatures rarely drop below zero, yet the wind and humidity combined create the feeling that it is colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are accustomed to human presence, their wild nature remains, so we should not feed or disturb them.
According to the park's regulations, maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
As calm as the bisons, the Canadian elks, the moose, the bears and almost all big animals may appear, they can still attack.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured as they do not keep appropriate distances. These animals are large, wild and can become dangerous, so leave them space.
Also, take into consideration that strong smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong smells and keep the camping area clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has almost 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in 1850, and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
A famous naval standoff took place in the harbor in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
All the ships sank except for a British destroyer. Around 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the May movement, a peaceful gathering in the city ended in the assassination of the supreme leader Tupoua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Oakland has two ports. The most popular are located in this area.
The beaches of the North Coast (in the North Harbor district) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Beach to the North to Newport to the South.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches suitable for safe swimming and most of them even have shading from the pine trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Harbor of the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes full of families with plenty of variety of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is called "Number One" and is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
A wide variety of French wines are available for tasting, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may be a better choice.
The tap water is absolutely safe to drink, but if you are afraid, you can easily find bottled water.
In Australia, the concept of flat white coffee is foreign. The short black is the espresso, the cappuccino is topped with cream and not foam, and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate meets the standards of Belgium. The fruit juices are expensive but amazing.
Many journeys take place in the sea throughout the year, and injuries due to some of these causes are rare in the sea.
Despite this, take advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay great attention to safety warnings.
Since 1770, jellyfish appear near beaches and river estuaries from October to April. Occasionally, they can be spotted at different times of the year.
Sharks do exist, however they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of them and would swim away from them.
Sea crocodiles do not live in the sea, their main natural habitat is the river estuaries north of the Roachampton.
By making a reservation in advance, travelers ensure that they will have accommodation to stay when they reach their destination.
Travel agents often make arrangements with specific hotels, but you can also make reservations for other types of accommodation such as camping through an agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, arrangements for transportation to/from the airport, or even combined packages of flights and hotels.
Your application can be put on hold if you need time to reconsider the offer or gather other documents for your trip (e.g. visa).
However, any modifications or requests should first be referred to the travel agent and not sent directly to the hotel.
Regarding some festivals, the majority of attendees at music festivals decide to camp there, and most consider it a very important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will need to start early to find a camping spot near the music.
Remember that while the music may end at the main stages, there may be parts of the festival where the music will continue until late at night.
Some festivals provide special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the position of your cabin, as when the ship passes through ice, tremendous noises are created for those who are more affected.
Cruises in Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Those boarding the ship are not required to have a visa (see terms).
Casinos usually make a great effort to maximize the time and money spent by the visitors. Windows and clocks are absent, while exits are difficult to find.
Many times there are special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep customers in a good mood and within the premises of the business.
In various places, free alcoholic drinks are offered. However, drunkenness affects judgment, and a good gambler knows the importance of remaining sober.
Whoever is going to travel by road at high altitude or through mountain passes, should consider the possibility of snow, ice, and very low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is not enough traction and driving is more difficult compared to bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, it can snow so much that it can trap you in a very short period of time.
Visibility can also be restricted during snowfall, moisture, or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, where traffic continues mostly uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest travel attraction in Africa and a must-see for many visitors.
The term safari is widely used as a land journey with the purpose of visiting the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savanna.

Ironing can help with drying wet clothes. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards for loan, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron available or you are not interested in wearing ironed socks, you can use a hairdryer in this case, if it is available.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to overheat (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are various ways of purifying water and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, one minute of boiling water is enough, but in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in terms of effectiveness and if you have any concerns, then you should consider the possibility of purchasing your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter infectious animals that they are not used to encountering in their home country.
Parasites destroy food, cause irritation or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, carry poison, and transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or wild animals that have the ability to attack or kill cruelly humans are not often characterized as harmful organisms.
Tax-free shopping opportunities allow you to purchase goods in specific locations without the burden of duties and special consumption taxes.

The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is very dangerous for driving on the Buffalo-Pittsburg highway, as it crosses many isolated rural areas.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, keep your eyes open: there are roads with steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections – usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour) and it is even more important to strictly obey them.
However, in a strange way, the mobile phone signal is much stronger here than along other parts of the route, such as in the Wilds of Pennsylvania.

With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a comprehensive term that encompasses a wide variety of cuisines from the regions throughout the country.
However, when used without other determiners, the term tends to indicate the food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
The local cuisine of Java can now be found everywhere in the archipelago, offering a menu of lightly spiced dishes with basic aromatic ingredients preferred by the people of Java such as peanuts, chili, sugar (specifically coconut sugar from Java), and a variety of aromatic spices.
The stirrups are used as support for the lower limbs of the rider and are held by the right and left side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, however they may pose challenges for safety due to the possibilities of getting their feet stuck in them.
If someone falls off the horse but their foot gets tangled in the stirrup, the horse can drag them along the road as it runs. To prevent this, certain safety precautions are taken.
Initially, most riders have special shoes with heels, soft and relatively small soles.
Then, some of the saddles, especially the English ones, have safety bars that allow a leather saddle to fall off if pulled backwards by the rider at the time of the fall.
Kotsamo Valley - The main climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America with a variety of big walls and granite cliffs.

Snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down downhill slopes covered in snow with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a significant travel activity with many enthusiasts, often referred to as ski bums, planning entire vacations for skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old. Cave paintings depict skiers dating back to 5,000 BC!
The downhill ski sport is even encountered in the 17th century, while in 1861, the first club for recreational skiing was founded in Australia by some Norwegians.
Backpacking with ski: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring, or backcountry skiing.
It is related to alpine skiing and mountaineering, but usually does not include them, as the latter are done on steep terrain and require much harder skis and boots.
Think of skiing as a similar way to cover distance by walking.
Under ideal conditions, you will be able to cover relatively longer distances than walking - but you will rarely develop the speeds of skiing on rough terrain without a heavy backpack on specially designed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal conditions, visiting many countries during the trip would require applying for visas and multiple passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, could be said to function as a single country under this prism.
As long as you stay in this zone, you are generally allowed to cross borders without passing through passport control checkpoints again.
By analogy, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each of the Schengen area member states, saving time, money, and bureaucratic procedures.
There is no universal definition by which a processed product can be classified as an antique. Some tax authorities define antiques as goods with an age of over 100 years.
The definition varies geographically, as the age limit may be lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handmade products can be defined as antiques, even though they are more recent than similar mass-produced goods.
Breeding reindeer is an important activity for the Sami, while the culture surrounding trade is also important for many who are involved in other professions.
Even by tradition, of course, not all the Sami participated in the large-scale reindeer breeding, but some lived by fishing, hunting, and other activities, mainly using reindeer as pack animals.
Today many Sami people work in modern commerce. Tourism is an important source of income for the Sami region.

A lesson, normally, will cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually due to practical exercises.
A lesson will usually last 2-5 days and will include role-playing games, extensive training in first aid, and sometimes with weapons.
The books and magazines that deal with survival in the desert are common, however publications that deal with the war zone are few.
Those who travel and plan gender reassignment surgery in another country must ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The intention of governments to issue passports without specifying gender (X) or documents that have been updated to correspond to the desired name and gender varies.
The appetite of foreign governments to respect these specific documents also changes significantly.
Research at security checkpoints has also become much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender individuals in pre-operative state cannot expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The surface currents are the returning flows from waves breaking on the beach, often in a sandbar or similar feature.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flows concentrate in some deeper sections where strong currents may occur at great depth.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion from attempting to swim against the current, which is not always feasible.
As soon as you are out of power, swimming to the shore won't be harder than usual.
You are trying to aim for a point where you have not been trapped again or, based on your skills and whether you have been located, it may be preferable to wait to be rescued.
The shock of return begins before the culture shock (the honeymoon phase diminishes), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes struggle to readjust to their native culture.
When you return to your country after living abroad, you have adjusted to the new culture and have lost some of your habits that belonged to the culture of your country.

Many may not anticipate the patience and understanding needed for travelers to return home.
One of the events that take place in the area and are of great interest to children is the sound and light show of the pyramid.

The scenes are projected on the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The Southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are a subject of dispute for many countries and have the most bases, as there are sixteen active ones in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is the island of King George, which also has the neighborhood of Villa las Estrellas.
Some include the islands of Livingston and Deception where the flooded crater of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Elsgorv Land is the region south of the peninsula, which is surrounded by the Belingxhausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula come together at this point with the plateau, and then reappear to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth mountain range, which is cut in half by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, including the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak at 4892 meters.
In isolated areas where there is no phone signal, a satellite phone might be your only option.
The satellite phone does not replace the mobile phone in general, as you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used in navigation, including leisure craft, as well as for missions using remote data and having voice communication needs.
Your local phone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
A choice that is becoming increasingly popular for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
It has a special appeal to people who have finished school, as it allows them to take a year off before starting university, without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap-year course abroad can increase your chances of advancing to higher education in your country.
Usually tuition fees are required for enrollment in such educational programs.
Finland is the ideal place for boat trips. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" you will find thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
The boat may not necessarily be useful to you in the archipelago and in the lakes.
While the archipelago and the largest lakes indeed have enough size for any leisure boat, smaller vessels or even kayaks provide an alternative experience.
Sailing with a boat is a national hobby for Finland, with one boat per seven or eight people.
This can be compared to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but in general, it is particularly unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Almost all special cruises in the Baltic include an extensive stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few full days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you disembark in the city only through excursions organized by the ship, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in their promotional brochures. As shown on the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by airplane can be considered a very frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic experience.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and dislikes that many people have for other things.
For some people, understanding how the aircraft functions and what happens during the flight can help them overcome the fear based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are paid handsomely for the fast delivery of goods. Often, time is a significant factor when it comes to professional documents, merchandise, or parts for an urgent repair.
The largest companies, for some routes, have their own planes, but there are problems regarding other routes and smaller companies.
If they sent items through air cargo transport, on some flights it may take days from unloading to customs.
The only way to get it through faster would be to send it as checked luggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and that's where your role comes in.
The obvious way to get into the first or the managerial position is to pay a bunch of money for the privileged position (or even better, ask your company to do it for you).
However, this comes at a cost: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the regular economy fare for a business seat and eleven times for a first seat!
In general, there is no reason even to seek discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airline companies know well that there is a basic category of passengers who are willing to spend a lot of money for the privilege of a fast and comfortable transition to their destination, and they charge accordingly.
Kishinev is the capital of Moldova. The local language is Romanian, however, Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a democratic state of many ethnicities that has been affected by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this dispute resulted in the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but has not been officially recognized by any member state of the UN.
The economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been restored, despite the fact that political negotiations failed.
The dominant religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

Typical announcements on the subway are only made in Catalan, but non-typical disturbances are announced by an automated machine that has a range of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The residents of Paris are renowned for their egocentrism, rudeness, and arrogance.
Although it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to do well in Paris is to show your best behavior, as if you are someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will make your social interactions much easier.
The abrupt attitude of Parisians will quickly disappear if you display basic courtesy.
In the national park at Plitvice Lakes, there is a lush forest with beech, fir, and spruce trees, while the flora is a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.

Men are also required to wear pants that cover their knees in the same way.
You can also borrow this from the stock at the entrance, but this particular garment is not washed after each use and therefore you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. It is one size for men!

Today, the prehistoric observatories are usually outdated and kept as museums or educational spaces.
At their peak, light pollution was not the problem that it is today, as they are often found in cities or university towns, and access to them is easier than to those built in modern times.
Most telescopes of our time are large facilities in isolated locations that have suitable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossom blooming, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept has its origins in China, where the blossoms of the damask rose were the flower of the season.

The Japanese work ethic has a more hierarchical and formal character compared to what Westerners are used to.
Suits are typical professional attire, and colleagues refer to each other by their last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, as the emphasis is on collective effort rather than rewarding individual accomplishments.
