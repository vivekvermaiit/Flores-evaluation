The chest did not confirm the name that at least a few dinosaurs had feathers, theories already well spread, but it also offered details that the fossils usually cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The feathers of these birds were brown with a hint of orange or even with carotenoid pigments.
The study also offers information about the evolution of plumage in birds.
Given that the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed central shaft, called a rachis, but have other features of feathers (filaments and barbs), researchers have concluded that the rachis most likely developed later in the evolution of these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggested they were not used for flight but to regulate temperature or to display. Researchers suggested that, although the tail belonged to a young dinosaur, the specimen displayed adult feathers and not the down of a juvenile bird.

Edgar Veguilla injured his arm and jaw, and Kristoffe Schneider needed reconstructive surgery in the hospital.
Uka's arm got stuck when she fell towards the head of a dog. Schneider suffered from chronic pain, lost the use of one hand and no longer has a piece of skull, but has a reconstructed nose made of titanium.
Schneider has witnessed through a remote video while being on a USAF base in his hometown.
On Wednesday's event, Carpanedo made two individual goals in the Championships.
Her first race was the slalom, which did not end in the first fall. 36 out of the 116 competitors achieved the same result in that race.
In other races, the giant slalom, she arrived in tenth place in the group of seated skiers with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first place, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth place, the Hungarian GyÃ¶ngyi Dani.
Four skiers from the group of seated skiers did not finish the race and 45 out of the 117 total skiers in the giant slalom did not place in the rankings.

The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services pulled the driver of the red Audi TT out.
In the beginning he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterwards he was transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
At that time, she was found in the Court of the Sheriff of Edinburgh, accused of having killed her son.
It is in custody that the accusation and the trial are open, but the evidence from the eyewitnesses can be falsified, since his photograph has been almost lost.
This practice is common throughout the rest of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish judicial system operates differently and therefore the publication of photographs can be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee has noted that "journalists often tread dangerously when they want to cross a line and publish photographs and other items of suspicion."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for judicial processes, has declared to journalists that it will not make any further comments until an indictment has been made.
According to the news report, the document will address the issue of the borders between Palestine and the desire for them to be based on the borders that were prior to the Six-Day War in the Middle East in 1967.
It has been reported that other topics relating to the future status of Jerusalem, sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while Palestine is asking for a presence of only five years.
The shooters in the integrated experiment of controlling infesting species turned out to be effectively controlled in a strict manner by the forest guards, while the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In the cooperation between the NPWS and the Australian Sporting Shooters Association (NSW Inc), qualified volunteers have been selected for the Association's hunting program.
According to Mick Oâ€™Flynn, the deputy director of conservation and heritage of the NPWS parks, the four selected shooters for the first culling operation have been trained and received comprehensive training on safety regulations.
Martelly Ã®r al Ã  fat zurÃ¢ un gnÃ»f Consei eletorÃ¢l provisori (CEP) di nÃ»f membris. Martelly has set up a new temporary Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
He is the fourth CEP of Martelly in four years.
Last month a presidential commission chaired and recommended the resignation of the first CEP as part of a package of measures to bring the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the large protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were caused by accusations of election fraud, partly stemming from actions taken as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunction due to overheating have been reported in iPods, with a total of six catching fire and causing minor burns to four people.

The Pacific tsunami warning center also said that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has attacked a group of tourists from Hong Kong after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza will scare away the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several houses have been buried in salt and it has been confirmed that at least six people have lost their lives for now.
You were standing next to fruit and grocery stores, as you were being swarmed like the Filipino paparazzi.
The photographers arrived too late to capture the image of an older woman who needed help from the office. Mendoza was already gone.
The boy followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He studied as an obstetrician and in 1959 he started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins started studying premature babies in his free time.
Her research showed that the administration of a hormone accelerated the fetal maturation of the fruit's lungs.
According to Xinhua, on Wednesday the government investigators found two "black boxes" with flight recorders.
Other wrestlers in wrestling have honored Luna.

Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was strange like me...maybe even more...I want a good life and I will miss her...I hope she is happy in a better place than this."
From 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal elections, those who were against the fact that Australia became a republic increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the interviewed people have the same opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the survey, 29 percent of the respondents want Australia to become a republic as soon as possible and 31 percent do not want Australia to ever become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist from Varese failed to swim in the 100 meters and 200 meters freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his injuries, his physical form was in doubt.

More people have verified the discovery using different hardware and software in the TacÃ¢ di FevrÃ¢r and the discovery was announced on Tuesday.
The comets could have been a source of water for Earth and also of organic matter which could have formed proteins and thus supported life.
They are trying to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth has formed, considering that comets have been colliding with the Earth for so long.
Cuomo (53 years old) became governor last year and last month signed a law to legalize same-sex marriage.
He said that the others were "stupid and foolish politics".
He says he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, will help airplanes fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
By using a technology based on satellites, in contrast to the older technology based on ground radar, it allows air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with more precision and give more accurate information to the pilots.
The underground trains will not stop at other stations and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking for cars or parking for interchange there are not available.
The fear of eating away from home has led to the hypothesis that the match would be rescheduled to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the GalÃ¡pagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden, the species developed in the name of two generations, even though it was thought that this process would last much longer, through interbreeding between a finch endemic to Darwin (endemic species), Geospiza fortis, and the cactus finch (immigrant species), Geospiza conirostris.
The gold can be worked to give all the shapes of forms and can also be wrapped in small forms.
You can pull it, making it become a fine wire that can be twisted and intertwined. You can also beat or flatten it into sheets.
You can make it become a true art and you can touch other people. You can make it become so fine that sometimes it was used to decorate the hand-made dissent in the books called "illuminated manuscripts".
The chest is called chemical. An indicator can be created through the structure of the purple cabbage.
The color of the litmus paper changes on the basis of it being exposed to substances that are either acid or alkaline.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical substances.
Hydrogen atoms are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms are made of one proton and one electron).
You have to put the two dry powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, you have to form a ball.
The humidity of your hands will react with the external layers, giving a strange sensation and forming a sort of coating.
Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with a drainage system connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
They found remnants of sewer systems in the houses of the ancient cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also cabinets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. During Roman civilization, cabinets were sometimes found in public baths, which were separate for men and women.
When someone calls someone who is far away, they use a satellite.
The space satellite picks up the call and then reflects it back almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a missile. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
To send a satellite or a telescope into space requires a giant missile, over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest advantage that the wheel has given us is that transportation has become much faster and easier.
We drove the train, the engine and many other means of transport.
Below these are also sought medium-sized felines that prey on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
In fact, there are also many small felines (like domestic cats) that eat a lot of smaller prey and even more numerous ones like insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, or a special skill that every cat has and that doesn't make them compete with others.
The lions are the most social of the felines and they live in large groups called prides.
Your words are sought after by one to three adult lions trained and up to thirty lionesses and cubs.
The daughters are usually educated in a strict manner, given that it is a large family of sons and daughters.
The branches of lions are similar in many ways to the branches of wolves or dogs, in behavior that seems to lions in a surprising way (but not to other large felines) and they have died due to predation.
A true athlete, the tiger can climb (though not so well), swim, jump a wall in length, and pull with a force five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger is part of the same group (or is the Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not as full as that of the lion, but it is more of a growl, like when it roars.
The ocelots prefer to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and even birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
The ocelots use their sense of smell to track and hunt their prey (or their prey), walking on the ground where the animals are.
You can see very well in the dark thanks to their nocturnal vision, and they also move in a stealthy way. Ocelots blend with the environment and then jump around their prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) is separated from the main population of origin (for example, if they pass through a mountain range or a river or if they go to a new island from which it is difficult to return) they will find themselves in a different environment than where they were before.
The new environment has different resources and challenges, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to become a good competitor compared to what was previously required.
The original population has not changed at all, and still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, they start to resemble less and less to the other population.
At the end, after millions of years, the two populations will have such a different appearance that they cannot be considered the same species.
Speciation is the process by which a new species is named. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
The plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe in, and they take in the carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (basically they exchange with breathing).
The plants produce their nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
I am a hunter and gatherer using plants. Most of the food of men is plants and, without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, so it had nothing to fear, except for other mosasaurs.
Her long hair was tangled by more than seventy-eight fasteners, just like another string of fasteners in the mouth of a pouch, so it was not easy for anyone who was in front of her.
It is not known for sure, but it might have had two rows of teeth. Its diet included large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have also been cannibalistic.
He could also hunt anything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could have competed with him.
Even if the majority of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual things to eat, like snails, peacocks, cheese, and a type of sauce called garum.
Another difference was that while the poor man and woman ate their food sitting on benches, the gentlemen liked to relax in the company, stretched out on the side while eating.
The food of the ancient Romans could only be obtained in Europe, America, or Asia centuries later.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever looked for turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered as the house of the god.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to take care of the needs of the gods with ceremonies and feasts.
Every temple had an outer courtyard and then a sanctuary inside where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes towers in the shape of a pyramid, called ziggurats, were built up as part of the temples.
The parish priest was the special sanctuary of God.
In the Mediterranean climate, the house was not as important.
Most of the Jewish women returned to life.
The women used to cook in the courtyard; the shops only had green benches where they put on the street. The stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was a scarce resource.
Greenland was colonized in a sparse way. The sagas tell us that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he sailed further west, he found and settled Greenland.
The Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time, not knowing their discovery.
Even if every nation was 'Scandinavian', there were still differences between the people, the languages, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the film National Treasure, you might think that it was painted a treasure map on the back of the declaration of independence.
Two houses, not one. Even if it is written elsewhere in the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text appears on the document's original parchment.
Even if no one knows for certain who wrote them, it is known that at the beginning of his life, the large parchment of the document (which measures 29Â¾ inches by 24Â½ inches) was made to put him away.
Not every notation has been set aside only to make labels.
The landing in Normandy and the battles afterwards had liberated the North of France, but the South was not yet free.
He was governed by the French from "Vichy". They were the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting.
On August 15th, 1940, the allies invaded France from the South, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In about two weeks, the American and Free French forces had liberated Southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word civilization derives from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and to civitas, meaning city or state, and which in some way also defines the dimension of a society.
The city is the cradle of the predecessors of nations. A civilization culture implies the passage of knowledge through different generations, a cultural imprint that persists and spreads.
The minor cultures gradually disappear without leaving evident signs of history and are not recognized as civilizations in fact.
Through the desire for revolutionary changes, the three states were inclined to form, at first, a weak central government - with a congress as the only component - under the articles of confederation.
At the congress, anyone could impose taxes, and since there was no executive or national judiciary, they relied on the state authorities, who were not very collaborative, to enforce all their laws.
He had no authority to prevail on the fiscal laws and tariffs between states.
The articles needed unanimous consent from all the states before being sent and the states were under the central government so that their representatives were supposedly submissive.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most victorious team in the world and was the champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
The most popular sports include playing soccer, playing volleyball, playing basketball, swimming, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One car racing.
I ski in winter and are more popular in the regions of the North, where Italians compete in international races and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
From the viewpoint of geography, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" due to the presence of a cluster/group of islands.
The beginning of Taiwan begins in the 16th century when European sailors passing through began to record the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its base in Southwest Taiwan, beginning a transformation in the native production practices of grains and employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty's army (1644-1912) took control of the western part of Taiwan and its northern coasts, declaring Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
. In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration is still ongoing today.
For example, the format of photographs of still images most common in the mountains is 35mm, which was the dominant dimension of film until the era of analog film.
It was still produced today, but more importantly, the rapport has been inherited from the formats of digital image sensors.
The format 35 mm is a bit imprecise, in fact it is 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the ratio more easily in whole numbers) is called 3:2.
A variety of common cheeses (like the APS cheese family, for example) are included in this report or they go together in one place.
The rule of thirds, often used and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that creates dynamism by maintaining a sense of order in an image.
It is established that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the examples).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion had united the states of Europe despite the differences in language and customs.
The king's power could influence everyone from the king to the common folk.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary resources of the church should be used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and wealth led to a certain way of dealing with things if this principle had been respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, the United Kingdom enforced a naval embargo on Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this embargo violated the generally accepted international law and the codified international agreements of the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom mined international waters to prevent any enemy vessels from entering internal sections of the ocean, posing a danger also for neutral ships.
Given that there had been a limited response to this tactic, Germany retaliated with a similar response to their submarine warfare without limitations.
From the 1920s, the prevalent attitude of a large part of the city dwellers and nations was that of pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, the nations wished to avoid these situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to work with the Edison company in the city of New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) for Thomas Edison.
The ancient ZinÃ© had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each phase of ZinÃ© or each family that ruled could be a characteristic dynasty.
With the passage of time, among every dynasty and those that followed, there was a period of instability with divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there were fierce battles among a series of nobles who fought for the throne.
That of the three kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with millions of people dead fighting to sit on the highest throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
They are a reflection of social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
With time, after the revolution, occupations were open to all candidates, allowing the most ambitious and determined to be successful.
He is going to the valley for military training because military rankings were based on social class instead of ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other nations to begin their revolution.
Muhammad was interested in deeper matters that go beyond the life of this world. He frequented a known cave called "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) to meditate.
The poet himself, who has survived through time, gives a lively image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The village is located on the bridge of one of the mountains to the north of Meche, and the land is completely isolated from the rest of the mountain.
It is not easy at all to find him even if one knows that he exists. Once inside the forest, it is complete isolation.
You can't see anything because the beautiful clear sky above and all the mountains that surround it. You can't see or hear much from the inside of this valley.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that is still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is part of the many large pyramid structures built to honor the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, contains a row of pyramids (and the Great Pyramid is the largest), a row of small tombs, a row of temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many other smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were also built to honor the women and family members of Khufu.
The symbol of "upward arrow" represents a V, and the symbol of "downward arrow" represents a rectangle or a square without the bottom part.
He wants to say that one should start on the bridge and release the bow, I want to say that you have to start from the nose (where the hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
An "upward arc" usually creates a softer sound, while a downward arc is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to mark with your pencil your signs, but be aware that the symbols to pass the stamped arch are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
King Louis XVI, terrified, the queen Marie Antoinette and their children (Marie Therese 11 years old and Louis Charles 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, on October 6th, 1789 were forced to return from Versailles to Paris by a crowd of women from the market.
A few chariots returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who were shivering and were making threats against the king and queen.
The marmot woke the king and queen by opening the shutters of the window.
At a certain point, a sea captain was shaking the head of one of the royal guards at Versailles in the museum of the terrorized queen.
The desire for American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines has harmed the Filipino people.
The natives were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to support a large part of the expenses and interests on the bonds that had moved into the hands of the Filipino government from the banking institutions on Wall Street.
The huge profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic advantages of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that arose at the creation of the order.
The time when events will reoccur and is often called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries (1000â€“1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
The term "technological determinism" encompasses a series of ideas, technological breakthroughs or technological imperatives to the extent that the destiny of human beings is determined by a logic underlying scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
- Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: that the development of technologies follows an independent path with respect to cultural and political influences, and that on the other hand, technologies have "effects" on the societies they are inherent to, rather than conditioning them at a social level.
For example, we can say that the car contributes to the development of the road system.
At home, a national highway network is not accessible at an affordable level for a lot of machines, so new production methods need to be developed to lower the costs for those who want to own a machine.
The motorization of masses also leads to more accidents on the roads, which in turn drives the development of new medical techniques to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, with writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
During the Romanticism era, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures related to that geography manifested themselves, and those, being in harmony with the social context, were better off than the arbitrary laws imposed.
As much as Paris, which today is known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was known as the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
His reputation as a center of luxury began in 400 A.D. and lasted until 1100 A.D.
His status had diminished towards the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with goods such as silks and spices that were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was during that period that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At the beginning, the visit was a strong influence of Byzantine culture in the East.
"Due to the slow pace of communication channels, they were 25 to 30 years behind in the West."
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of that time was the result of the Crusades, which led to the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
The subsistence agriculture is an agriculture that focuses on producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
The subsistence agriculture is a simple and sustainable biological system that uses native seeds and methods in ecological regions combined with crop rotation or other very simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers were employed in subsistence agriculture, and it is still the case in many countries due to lack of development.
The subcultures bring together individuals with similar mentalities who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive based on age, ethnicity, class, position, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
The members of a subculture often signal their belonging through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses mannerisms, modes, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by the adults responsible for their upbringing.
These children were called "wild" or abandoned. Some wild child was kept locked up (usually by the parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child resulted from the rejection by the parents of a child with a serious physical or intellectual disability.
The saved children may have experienced heavy abuse or trauma before being abandoned or ran away.
Sometimes it is thought that they were raised by animals; some say they have lived saved by themselves.
When they are raised together with non-human animals, wild fruits show behaviors almost entirely similar (within physical limits) to those of the particular animal they have been raised with, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding is a step forward.
The scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a support that helps individuals who are experiencing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding but can also be the small, creative person who uses Microsoft Office.
The virtual assistants are incorporated into the software and are made to ask questions, provide assistance, and explain procedures that can be very difficult to manage for the average user.
The fruits are given in trust for a variety of reasons that range from abandonment to abuse and even extortion.
No fruit can grow in an environment that is not caring, affectionate, and educational, but instead hostile.
We perceive the trust system as a safe zone for these fruits.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The trust fund is intended to provide for all the needs that have been neglected at home where the fruits have been picked.
Internet has become both a means of mass communication and a tool for interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet have brought an additional dimension to the theory of use and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for the use of the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" have been identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating the public's reactions to internet sites.
The use of video recording has led to the discovery of important details in the interpretation of micro expressions, fleeting movements of the muscles that last only a few milliseconds.
In a particular way, it is believed that one can perceive if a person is lying by interpreting the micro-expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," indicated that people who are not good at understanding a speech for a brain injury can accurately evaluate sincerity.
The suggestion is perhaps that these abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
The research of the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variations: latent and manifest.
The mutation generates new genetic variations and the selection removes them from the set of visible variations.
Segregation and recombination often occur within and between the two sets with each generation.
In animals it is difficult for a first pass through the digestive system like that of humans to meet amino acid requirements with available vegetal resources.
With that, failure in the harvest can lead to serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition, and even death.
The vegetable resources accessible in a much easier way would produce proteins from plants and insects, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us if not cooked.
Eating insects (ants, termites, grasshoppers) is not only easy to digest, but it also provides a large amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
Considering all things, our ancestors would not have been amazed if they had already solved the "protein problem" more or less in the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
The interruption of sleep is the process of waking up during the normal sleep periods and returning to sleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be done more easily by using a specialized software that can help without needing to know everything.
If you try to restore her within the dream, you can put her in another room, so you can come out of the womb to study her.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking a glass of fluids (in particular water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before going to bed, avoiding to wake up to urinate.
The quantity of food a person has inside is inversely related to the amount of tension in the body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive and vital life force is present. Every person has the potential to find peace and inner peace.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that prevents us from reaching the goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana of love and a set of Indian yoga techniques.
In the beginning, Tibetan Buddhism is a quite easy path. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and ways of love that embrace everything.
With kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) awakens with the yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of divinity. Through the visualization of a variety of deities, the channels of energy are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the second world war, despite the cooperation between the USSR and the United States. The clash of systems, processes, and cultures led to the discord among those nations.
After two years of the end of the war, the echoes of it were now fading and the Cold War was beginning.
He will have served for successive 40 years and will have fought bravely, leading armies in order to secure, on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize on the Romanian border.
Two of these plans were revealed almost alive at night, when 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large amounts of goods across the oceans.
By tradition, the work of the mariners was to ensure that their nation maintains the ability to move goods and at the same time interfere with the enemy's ability to move goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the Second World War North Atlantic campaign. The Americans tried to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help the United Kingdom.
During these times, the German navy, mainly using U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the allies had failed, Germany might have succeeded in conquering the United Kingdom as it had done with the rest of Europe.
The first time they were domesticated is estimated to be around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to wool, hair, meat, and leather.
The oldest goats were usually kept in herds that grazed in the hills or other areas of pasture, then they were taken care of by older or younger goats, in a way similar to the most experienced shepherds. These methods of leading the animals to pasture are still used today.
The roads for the carts were already built in England in the 16th century.
Although the roads for carts consisted only of short parallel wooden beams, they allowed the drivers to arrive at higher speeds and carry larger loads than those of the roads a bit more traveled at times.
The workers were introduced in the evening shift to maintain the machinery in their place. Sometimes, on the other hand, it was understood that the machines would have been more efficient if they had received some iron strokes on them.
This has become a common practice, but the iron was still enjoying the heat of the coals.
In the end, wooden wheels started to be replaced with metal ones. In 1767, the first all-metal wheel was introduced.
The first clear evidence of the human presence is the footsteps, humans began to walk about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecus, did not walk upright habitually.
The bipedal specializations are found in the Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, even though Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
You can start living in a more friendly way towards the environment, you can join environmental movements and also become active in reducing future suffering.
The chest is really just symptomatic treatment in a case of need. In any case, if you don't want just a temporary solution, then you would have to find the causes of the problems and address them.
It is clear that the mountain has changed once due to the scientific and technological developments of humanity, and problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After the adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4th, a handwritten copy signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to some isolated distant John Dunlap's print shops.
The Dunlap flyers are printed in quantities between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "Dunlap flyers".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on August 8th.
One was sent on the 6th of July, to George Washington, informing him of the arrival of the troops in New York on the 9th of July. A copy arrived in London on the 10th of August.
The 25 Dunlap's copies are known to still exist and are the oldest surviving copies of that document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
A group of paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. They call it "uciei".
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But I am a bit wary of things that come from the same place as dinosaurs.
They walk on all fours with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
In practical terms, all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use in the computer language.
The internal poisoning of the livestock may not be immediately visible. Symptoms such as vomiting are enough to prevent an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of a spilled container of drugs or toxic household chemicals.
Check the labels for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term could be used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This familiarity is often based on old family ties, which are often mistaken for parasitizing men.
Sit on the stone seats or on the tree stumps at sunset to enjoy the night, accustomed to living in the night or in the home of the host.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which make it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
SM is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research found that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A grain then decides that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their fruit, to grow a little fruit.
These couples can make an adoption plan for their children.
In an adoption, the natural parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to discover how the world functions using scientific methods. These methods effectively guide most scientific research.
Not always, experimentation, and an experiment is a process that is used to test one or more possible hypotheses, also asking questions and making observations to guide scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially on the Latin Bible.
They were influenced by Aristotle's opinions on all scientific subjects, including psychology.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from the Greek leaders of philosophy and science.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology and behavior, especially depending crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only responses to external periods but have been documented in most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that can proceed through a period of cyclic behavior even without external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to inject their DNA into bacteria.
Two experiments have been carried out marking the DNA in the bacteria with the radioactive phosphorus and the bacteria protein with radioactive sulfur.
The mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material and if the affected cells are germ line cells.
Only the mutations in the germ line cells can be passed on to offspring, whereas mutations in other tissues can lead to cell death or cancer.
Tourism based on nature attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to appreciate the scenery, including the plants and the wildlife.
Examples of outdoor activities include hiking, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks to study information related to the ecosystem.
One example is to visit, photograph, and learn something about the orangutan's habitat in Borneo.
Every morning he leaves the small villages in the countryside by car to go to work and meets those who have the destination of work in the place they have just left.
In this fast-paced world, all dynamics support and are connected to a transportation system based on private cars.
The current science indicates that these large-scale carbon economies have disrupted the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution in the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
Developed countries are experiencing increasingly rare levels of concern about water quality or the points that are going down.
Why do transportation systems generate these breakdowns, why do they fail every other day? Are transportation engineers really incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
The flow of traffic is the study of the movement of cars and other vehicles between two points and the interaction they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying the flow of traffic is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Luckily, the traffic flows tend to find a certain constancy and can be represented in a fairly mathematical way.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and management of road infrastructure.
The first ones were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to move their wings to propel themselves forward.
The heart of a lion is much larger than the places where the predators roam.
Today there are only insects that cannot flap their wings to follow their prey and the ephemeral ones.
Many years ago, a man named Aristarcus claimed that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
Some thought that they were right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and perhaps other stars) inside.
Is the ground shaking, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries the most water of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with points where it reaches six miles in width.
Twenty percent of the water that drains from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It gathers the water of a thousand smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of stone pyramids began all the way back to the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza have never been surpassed in their dimensions and technical excellence of their construction.
"The ancient Egyptians of the Pharaoh's time were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were many years old."
The population of the Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent nation in the world and the nation with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the most widely used language by those who work in the state where Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as these can be found in nature in native forms and are quite easy to extract with primitive methods.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. They were earth, water, air and fire.
The chest was most similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, even though it was theorized that they also change into new substances to form what they see.
The basic laws are the combination of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
The elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Clearly they are also considered metals like platinum and gold.
They can also see fluids that take in small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The whole Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
I am so tiny in such an incredible way that billions of me could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
All, the wolf was a good friend to a variety of people when he came out.
Print, while they were coming out new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser position and use.
Nowadays people write messages on computer screens, without ever needing to pick up a pencil.
You can only wonder what the future will hold for keyboards when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to put together a nucleus with a certain number of protons and neutrons.
I struggled to lift a heavy box up onto a shelf. Splitting the nucleus still releases some of those energies.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus and want to split with little or no provocation.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called crust.
The layer is about 70 km thick closer to the ridge and 100 km thick farther away.
It is more humid under the sea and drier under the highlands.
She could be more delicate on the closest side because the crust is thinner. It was easier to come up towards the surface.
The theories of content are focused on finding what resonates or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that the child has certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized during the process of maturing towards adulthood.
These theories explain what certain people do in order to obtain the things they want and what kind of things they will or will not do in their environment.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Speaking in a very general way, they can come out in two ways when the survivors start emptying their part once. On one side of the mirror, they have tried to remain "one of the children" (or children).
The administrator has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
From the other side of the mirror, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that they have to change everything that the group was doing and make it their own.
In the end, the leader is essentially responsible for the success or failure of the group.
The behavior afterwards resulted in a conflict between the leader and the rest of the group.
The virtual groups are treated with the same level of excellence as the conventional groups, but there are subtle differences.
The members of the virtual group function as a bridge of contact for their immediate physical group.
The members of the conventional group will have more autonomy, as their group can meet at different times that may not be suitable for local management.
The presence of an "invisible group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual group.
The "invisible group" is the management group that every member reports to. The invisible group sets the criteria for each member.
Why should an organization go through a process that wastes time to create a learning organization? The purpose of practicing the concepts of organizational learning is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and innovation can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization that works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the needs of the customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, the management has to create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous methods and approaches used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data provide physical evidence of theoretical methodologies for cognitive investigation, thus strengthening the areas of research and making them more precise.
The correlation between cervical pathology and behavior supported the scientists in their research.
It is known that various types of damage to the brain, such as trauma, injuries, and tumors, can affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The birth of new technologies allows us to see and explore the structures and processes of the brain never seen before.
We provide a wide range of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Even if AI has strong connotations of fantasy, AI forms an important field of computer science, which manages intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation in a machine.
The research in AI involves creating machines for automatic functions that require intelligent behavior.
I have examples of taking control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to clients' diagnoses and questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voices, and moods.
These disciplines have become separate fields, focusing on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system has been widely used today in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military field, as it has been incorporated into a variety of household computer applications and software for video analysis.
The field trips are an important part of every classroom. However, a teacher may not enjoy taking his students to places where the bus trip is not possible.
Technology offers a solution with virtual tours. Students can watch museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful artwork while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual trip is also a way to reflect on our journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina plan a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to make diaries.
I can also improve the way students write. Usually, students begin their experience with a blog with poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of a public usually changes them.
Since the students are the most critical audience, the blog author begins to work on improving the writing and avoiding criticism.
With time, write a blog on "how students can become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to fuel public interest inspires students to be intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Writing a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond traditional school days.
The use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by responding actively to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings as well as outline their points of view on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the bilingual administrative capital of Canada and offers a range of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
To the South are the waterfalls of the Niagara and to the North is the homeland of natural beauty in Muskoka and beyond.
All these factors and others still highlight Ontario as what is considered the quintessential Canadian province by outsiders.
The bigger ones are mostly to the north, they are rather sparsely populated and some are wild and almost uninhabited.
To make a comparison of population that amazed one view at a time: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian city dwellers.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean along the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is quite a beautiful and large island, almost the size of a continent, especially when referring to its wildlife.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations, associated with France, and famous as well as luxurious seaside locations.
The Arabs have also brought Islam to these lands, and it has taken root especially in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and European colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route from the Cape of Good Hope to India.
In the North the region is limited by the Sahel, and in the South and West by the Atlantic ocean.
Women: it is recommended that any traveler and woman should be married, regardless of their civil status.
The young man also has a ring (but not a too expensive one).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they consider to be offensive, and it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, and pulled forward.
You have to be strong in refusing men, and not be afraid to maintain your position (cultural differences or not, I don't mean it in a bad way!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by a Berber fisherman in the 10th century BC, and it was later used by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese had enjoyed it and built it with the money from Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake in 1755.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt it in Daru I-Badya and not Casablanca, where the Spanish merchants who had established their commercial bases there were removed.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting cities in all of Morocco where to buy.
The old Medina is easy to find shops selling traditional goods from Morocco, like tagine, ceramics, leather goods, spices, and plenty of souvenirs, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the streets, especially in the city center.
Even if Goma and its surroundings are safe, for all visits outside of Goma it is necessary to inquire to understand the situation of the conflicts that occur in the provinces of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with a few of the best-priced itineraries to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
One can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to go around in Goma. The normal price (local) is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has ended up being used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today Timbuktu is a famous city, even though its reputation is a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the list of World Heritage Sites in danger due to threats from desertification.
It was one of the longest stops during the PBS special African American Lives by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is in stark contrast with the rest of the nation's cities, because it has a more open style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 kmÂ² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a diverse wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered a diamond bridge to the national parks of South Africa (SANParks).
Like all national parks in South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and entry into the park.
You could benefit from purchasing a Wild Card, which provides access to selected parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider as the main center.
The parade of buildings that creates the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a bar chart that clearly shows the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbor.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of the urban development on the island of Hong Kong is a remarkable sight on the reclaimed land to the north.
Chest al Ã¨ il puest che i colonizadÃ´rs britanics si son apropriÃ¢ts e duncje se tu ciris provis dal passÃ¢t coloniÃ¢l dal teritori, chest al Ã¨ un bon puest dulÃ  scomenÃ§Ã¢. That is the place that the British colonizers appropriated, and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, that is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching for 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just thick mangroves: they hide within them some of the last areas of trees from the immense jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 kmÂ², of which one third is covered by water/marsh areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been the sanctuary of wild fauna, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, especially those heading towards East and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since the intercity buses are often full, it's better to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese minibuses, which are agile and sturdy.
The shared taxis are faster and more convenient for traveling to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock river is a suspended bridge with cables. It crosses the Oyapock river to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and have two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The clear space below the bridge is 15 meters in vertical height. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control points are expected to be completed.
The GuaranÃ­ were the most important indigenous group that used to live in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region used to be the territory of other indigenous tribes such as the GuaycurÃº and the PayaguÃ¡, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was born, initially called "The giant province of the Indians", as a result of the encounters between the Spanish conquerors and the groups of native indigenous people.
The Spanish started the colonization period that lasted for three centuries.
Since its foundation in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain a strong indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest event of the year took place in December in the Las CaÃ±itas polo fields.
Here are tournaments and matches in other times of the year too.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), its value is fixed to be equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
The money can only be exchanged at the banks on the islands and at Stanley's West Store on the other side of the FIC.
The English pound in general is accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley they also accept credit cards and American dollars.
On the most remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, even if English and American currencies can be used; it is up to the individual property owner to determine what methods of payment are acceptable.
It is almost impossible to change the value of the Falkland Islands outside the islands, so change the currency before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, here it is Summer when it is Winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
Montevideo is subtropical; in the summer months temperatures above 30Â°C are common.
Winter can be cold in a very insidious way: temperatures may rarely go below zero, but the combined air and humidity make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
I am not of the opinion that there are "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains more or less the same throughout the year.
Even if some park animals are used to seeing humans, wild fauna is in any case wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
As park authorities, one must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
It doesn't matter how many predators can dream, bison, elk, moose, bears and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get hurt because they haven't respected the appropriate distance. These animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
With that, be careful that the smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking odoriferous food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850 by the Votcent and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a shipwreck in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sent down, except for one English crossing guard. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
Tamasese Lealofi III's head of state leadership ended in a swift but peaceful gathering in the city, organized by the Mau movement for independence.
There are a lot of places to visit, thanks to the fact that Auckland is located on two coasts. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The areas of North Head (in the district of North Harbour) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the North to Devonport in the South.
There are almost always safe places to swim where the tide is low, and most of the shade comes from the pohutukawa trees.
The spaces of Tamaki Drive overlook the Waitemata Port, in the exclusive neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are great places for women, sometimes full of people, with a good variety of shops nearby. Swimming is not allowed.
The main local beer is called "Number one", it is not a complex beer, but rather mild and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
They are a lover of French wines from the province, but the wines from New Zealand and those from Australia suit me better.
The tap water here is a safe thing to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are cautious.
Australians came up with the idea of 'flat white' coffee, and it is popular. A short black is 'espresso', the cappuccino comes with lots of milk foam, and tea is served without milk.
The chocolate is cold and is of Belgian level. The fruit strudels are expensive but excellent.
A variety of trips to the coral barriers are organized throughout the year, and unfortunately, due to one of these reasons, trips to the coral barriers are rare.
With all that, listen to the authorities' advice, obey all the rules and pay attention to safety warnings.
The bears generally move from the mountains to the river estuaries from October to April, to the north of the 1770. They can also be found sporadically outside of this period.
There are good dogs, but it is rare that humans understand them. Most dogs are scared of humans and run away.
The saltwater crocodiles do not live predominantly deep in the ocean, their main habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Book in advance to give the traveler peace of mind of having a place to sleep when they reach their destination.
The travel agents are available to make arrangements with specific hotels, although a travel agent can also book other forms of accommodation, such as camping.
The travel agents usually offer packages that include accommodation, airport transportation or even combined travel and hotel packages.
You can also block the reservation if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (for example, the visa).
Any modifications or requests must go through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For high festivals, most of those who participate in the music festivals decide to camp on the spot, and most of the participants consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be part of the action you will have to find a true passion to find a place where to live with music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stage is over, there can be other sections of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some campsites have special areas for children with small fruits.
If you traverse the Baltic from the North in winter, check the cabin's position, because crossing the ice can cause a rather unpleasant experience for the most susceptible.
The cruise ships in St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are required to visit (check conditions).
The casinos usually try to squeeze as much time and money as possible out of the guests. The balconies and clock are usually not there, and the bathrooms are difficult to find.
They usually have special offers for food, drinks, and entertainment, to keep their guests happy and stay in the place.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks from home. However, being drunk compromises judgment, and every good player knows the importance of being sincere.
