While an experimental vaccine seems to be able to reduce the death toll of Ebola, there are no medicines that have proven to be effective in treating existing infections so far.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially seemed promising in the field, but formal studies indicated that it was less advantageous than anticipated for preventing death.
In the PALM study, ZMapp functioned as a control, meaning that researchers used it as a starting point and compared the three other treatments to it.

This confirms, not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, already a widely spread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangements.
Researchers say that the fur of this animal was chestnut brown on the upper part with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The finding also provides insight into the evolution of feathers when it comes to birds.
Since the dinosaur feather does not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but had other features of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers assumed that the rachis was most likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers hinted that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the samples show adult feathering and not down from a young bird.

The luminosity and rotation are used to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number is, the less active the star is when it comes to magnetic reversal.

The current senator, and Argentina's first lady, Lady Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, announced her presidential candidacy last night in La Plata, a city 50 kilometers away from Buenos Aires.
Kirchner announced her intention to run for president at the Argentine theater, the same place where she began her campaign for the senate as a member of the delegation in the province of Buenos Aires in 2005.
The debate was triggered as a result of controversy over the spending of emergency aid and reconstruction, as a result of Hurricane Katrina; which some fiscally conservative individuals comically referred to as "Bush's New Orleans deal."
The liberal criticism of the reconstruction effort has been directed towards the benefits the reconstruction contracts have provided to the individuals within Washington.

The work that was done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would have been a result of tidal forces between the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
In the same way as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a gravitational pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The researchers were able to conclude that dark matter affected other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the particularly drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "highly disturbing and alarming due to the high death rate."
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have been infected with the virus at the hospital, and that at least two were hospital staff.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed ballot indicating their choice of candidate in an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting form.
The French election law codifies the treatment relatively strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes in them at the beginning of the voting process and that no envelopes are added except those from carefully counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every single part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under careful observation and by following specific procedures.

Schneider testified through a video link from his home country's US air force base.
After Wednesday's event, Carpanedo has competed in two individual races in the championships.
Her first was slalom where she received a 'did not finish' in her first run. 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
In her second race, giant slalom, she came in tenth in the women's standing group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winner Claudia Loesch from Austria, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth place Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to complete their race, and 45 out of the total 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to rank in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Assistant Police Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who assaulted the Swiss woman and have found her laptop and mobile phone".
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
. The chief inspector of the police, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, has said that the accused had appeared in court with covered faces.
Even though three people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
The driver in the car still sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the generous Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been accused of killing her son in Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but evidence from eyewitnesses may have been manipulated as images of her have been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scotland's legal system seems different and the court has considered the publication of possibly prejudiced images.
Professor at the University of Dundee, Pamela Ferguson, said "journalists seem to be taking a dangerous direction if they publish pictures and the like of suspects."
The public prosecutor's office, which has the overall responsibility for prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be given at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Pakistan wants based on the borders before the Middle East war in 1967.
Other topics covered, according to reports, include the future of the state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the conflict over the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands an ongoing military presence in the valley for ten years after a agreement is signed, while the Palestinian authorities only agree to such a presence for five years.
Shooters in the supplementary pest control trial were to be closely monitored by guards while the effectiveness of the trial project was assessed and monitored.
In partnership with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooter's Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooter's Association's hunting program.
According to the acting director of Park Protection and Heritage at the Service for National Parks and Wildlife, the first four selected shooters received safety and training instructions for the first shooting operation.
Martelly swore in a new provisional electoral council (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous provisional electoral council as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to a widespread anti-regime protest that began in October.
The occasionally violent protest was triggered when an election had not been held, some dating back to 2011.
There have been reported around 60 cases of iPods overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and four people experiencing minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it had been aware of 27 accidents related to the units.
Last week, the Ministry of Trade and Industry announced that Apple had informed them about 34 more cases of overheating that the company called "non-serious".
The department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "highly regrettable".
The earthquake hit the Marianas at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the crisis management agency in the Northern Mariana Islands, there were no reports of damage in the commonwealth.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former policeman from the Philippines took Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza used an M16 rifle when he shot at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, but it has been confirmed that at least six people have died so far.
Six hostages, the children and the elderly, were released early, and so were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an older lady who had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's national women's hospital in 1959.
While he worked at the hospital, Liggins started researching premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it could induce maturation of the fetus' lungs.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that investigators from the authorities had found the two 'black boxes' with the airplane's audio recordings.
Other athletes also praised Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a night with two moons. Quite unique, just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as crazy as me... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place."
Based on a survey of 1400 people before the federal election in 2010, it was revealed that the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 campaign for the federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those who participated in the opinion poll shared this view and wished for Queen Elizabeth to become Australia's last monarch.
At most, 29 percent of those polled thought that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but as a result of his complaints, doubts have been raised about his form.
He has not been able to take the necessary medication to alleviate the pain, as they are illegal in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Thursday.
Comets may possibly have been a source of delivery of water to Earth, along with organic material that can form proteins and support life.
Researchers hope to understand how planets are formed, particularly how Earth took shape since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, started his position as governor earlier this month and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political talk and nonsense".
There is speculation that he will run as a presidential candidate in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the American aviation control claims can allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Satellite-based technology is used instead of older radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with better precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There has been no additional transport offer and trains overground will not stop at Wembley, in addition parking and park and ride are not available on site.
Fear of lack of transportation has hinted at the possibility that the matches will take place behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new bird species evolved after only two generations, even though it was believed that this process took much longer, as a result of breeding between the endemic Darwin finch, the intermediate ground sparrow, and the immigrated cactus finch, Geospiza conirostis.
Gold can be molded into any shape. It can be rolled into very small forms.
It can be spun into thin thread that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered and rolled out into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that sometimes it can be used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called a chemical's pH. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (the 'H' in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of electrons (since a hydrogen atom consists of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then press them together into a ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo had a flush toilet in almost every house, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains from the sewage system have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were present together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call in order to reflect it back down, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Researchers use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
It requires a large rocket that is over 100 feet tall to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us much easier and faster possibilities for transportation.
We have been given the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them, there are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from hares to antelopes and deer.
In the end, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat a much more varied selection of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of niche, a specific job that each cat has that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live together in large groups called prides.
Groups are formed by one to three adult male lions, together with as many as thirty lionesses and their offspring.
The lionesses are usually related to each other, and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave very similarly to a wolf pack or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly for their prey.
As a highly flexible athlete, the tiger can climb (although not very well), swim, run long distances, and exert the strength of five times that of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as the lion's, but more like a string of growling, howling words.
The ocelots like to eat small animals. They often catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Researchers believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by using their sense of smell, they sniff their way to where they have been on the ground.
They have night vision that allows them to see very well at night, and they also move very smoothly. Ocelots hunt by camouflaging themselves in their surroundings while they wait for their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population they came from (such as if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island making it difficult for them to go back) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they came from.
This new environment has different resources and other competitors, which means that the new population will need different traits or adaptations to become a strong competitor than those they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population has started to adapt to their new environment, which makes them start to become more and more different from the other population.
Finally, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (in other words, exhalation).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is from plants. Without plants, animals would not have been able to survive.
The mosasaurus was a top consumer in its time, so it feared nothing - except for other mosasaurs.
The long-jawed male was surrounded by more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and with an extra set in the palate. In other words, there was no way out for those who crossed his path.
We do not know for sure, but he may have had a split tongue. The diet included shellfish, large fish, and other mosasaurs. He may even have been a cannibal.
He attacked everything that ended up in the water - even gigantic dinosaurs, like the Tyrannosaurus rex, were no match for him.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans nevertheless had some unusual dishes for their feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
Another inequality was that while poor people and women ate their meals sitting, the rich men liked to have banquets lying down while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included food that came to Europe or America from Asia in later centuries.
They for example did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa and no Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered their home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to take care of the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, and an inner sanctuary that only priests had access to.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not particularly important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The women did the cooking in the farmyard; shops were only open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he journeyed further west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Even though he made this discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Even though each of the countries was "Scandinavian", there were great differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might believe that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
This is still not correct. Even though something is written on the back, there is no treasure map.
The words "original declaration of independence dated July 4, 1776" are written on the back of the declaration of independence. The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one can say for certain who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up early in its lifespan for storage.
It is therefore likely that the note was simply added as a marking.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part was still not liberated.
It was controlled by the French Vichy regime. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15th, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and independent French forces had liberated the southern part of France, and were on their way towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture that is shared by a group of people of significant size who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and in a way also defines the size of the society.
City-states are the drivers of nations. A civilizational culture insinuates the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a lingering cultural imprint and fair dissemination.
Lesser cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to become known as proper civilizations.
Through the revolutionary war, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with the Congress as its only component - under the decisions of the confederation.
The Congress lacked any power to implement taxes, and as there was no executive or judicial system, it relied on the state authorities, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its decisions.
It also did not have the authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The decisions required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be changed, and the states were so lax with the central government that their representatives were often absent from each other.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, are the second most successful football teams in the world, and were FIFA World Cup winners in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in the international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
As a result of the clusters/groups of islands Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geological perspective, as an "archipelago".
The beginning of Taiwan goes all the way back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the indigenous population's grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces from the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, which transferred sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the country until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main constructions, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been reconstructed and the rebuilding process has continued to this day.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog era.
It is still being produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, a bit confusing, 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest complete ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats for example) are similar to, or approximately the same as, this aspect ratio.
The much criticized and often ridiculed rule that one-third is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a sense of order in the picture.
It says that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines, which divides the picture into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound together European states, despite differences in language and customs.
It had an all-encompassing power that affected everyone from the king to the common citizen.
One of the most important Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the church are there for this very reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being upheld.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective when it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international laws, codified by several small international agreements over the past two decades.
Great Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent all ships from sailing into the entire maritime area and causing damage to even neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most inhabitants were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the hardship and heartlessness of war during the First World War, nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the USA to take a job at the Edison company in the city of New York.
He came to the USA with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a testimonial from Charles Batchelor (his former manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of displaying different time periods; each step of China and each family in power became a distinctive dynasty.
Also between each dynasty there was an unstable age of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the era of the three kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there were often fierce warfare between many noble who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the ancient history of China, with thousands of people dying while fighting for the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects of the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism and republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not a single ruler.
After the revolution, positions were also open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military when ranking is now based on skills instead of class, as it had been before.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people, from oppressed working classes in other countries, to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters outside his everyday life. He often used a cave on the mountain "Noor" (light) for contemplation, which became known as "Hira".
The mine itself, which survived through time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual decay.
The mine sits on top of the mountains north of Mecca, and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
She is actually not easy to find at all, even though one knows she exists. When one is inside the mine, one is completely isolated.
You can't see anything other than a clear, beautiful sky above, and the many mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the mine.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century before our era, and is one of the many pyramid structures that were built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-curve" mark looks like a V and the "down-curve mark" looks like a staple or square is missing on the bottom.
Up means that you should start at the top and push the book, and down means that you should start at the frog (where your hand is holding the book) and pull the book.
An up-bow usually creates a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more determined.
Feel free to create your own marks, but remember that the markings are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob of people who were screaming and shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to keep the windows of the carriage completely open.
At one point, a member of the mob held up the head of a royal guard, who was killed in Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses, and interest in bonds dwindled in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking system.
The super profit derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would of course constitute the fundamental achievements of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that facilitated the formation of the order.
The era when these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages came after the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological progress or the technological imperative, to a strong sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: That the development of technology follows a path far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on society that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
One can for example say that the motor vehicle will necessarily lead to the development of roads.
A nationwide road network is still not economically viable to serve only a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
The common ownership of cars also leads to higher occurrence of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the healthcare system discovering new techniques for treating injured individuals.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from authors like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, the customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and those that were in harmony with the place for society were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center for luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
This status was reduced during the twelfth century, mainly because the fact that the crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued higher than what Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title fashion capital, from Constantinople to Paris, happened.
Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the dress was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
Due to slow communication channels, the styles in the west could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own style. One of the biggest developments at the time, as a result of the Crusaders, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Agriculture for subsistence is agriculture that is practiced to produce enough food to only meet the needs of the person who is farming and his/her family.
Agriculture for sustenance is a simple, often organic system that uses saved seeds from the eco-region combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in agriculture for sustenance, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals, who feel neglected by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive as a result of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
A member of a subculture often signals their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behavior, and argot.
One of the most common methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to highlight the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Children like these are called "wild" or unruly. Some wild children have been restricted by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this surrender of children is a result of the parents rejecting a child's serious, intellectual, or physical difficulties.
Wild children may have experienced child abuse or trauma before becoming abandoned or run away from home.
Others have been claimed to have been raised by animals; some have been thought to have lived alone in the wild.
When fully raised by non-human animals, wild children show behavior (within physical constraints) almost identical to that of the current nurturing animals, such as fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, constructivist design takes learning a step further.
Constructive design is not a teaching method, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals who are engaging in a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized in the software and are meant to question, guide, and clarify procedures that could have been too demanding for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster homes for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse and even to blackmail.
No children should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
We are looking at the child welfare regulation as a safety zone for these children.
Our child welfare regulation is meant to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, and stable education, in addition to reliable healthcare.
Foster homes are meant to cover all the needs that were lacking in the home they were taken away from.
The internet combines elements from both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the internet led to multiple dimensions in terms of approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important motivations for online use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "sustained relationship" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, movements in the face that last for a few milliseconds.
It is particularly claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his thesis "The President's Speech," indicated how people who are unable to understand speech as a result of brain damage are still able to correctly assess facial expressions.
He even suggests that such skills to interpret human behavior can be shared by domestic animals such as dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination moves the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to fulfill its need for amino acids from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, it has serious consequences if one fails with this: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible sources of nutrients would have been the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primitives like us to digest.
In contrast, not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) digestible, they also provide a high amount of protein that contains all the necessary amino acids.
With all this in mind, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a somewhat similar way as chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of waking intentionally during your normal sleep period and falling asleep again shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a silent alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, known diuretic fluids) before sleep, which will force one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person holds inside is opposite to the amount of tension in one's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path to all-embracing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center for Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and enlightened awareness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the second World War, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the USA. At the end of the war, the conflicting systems, processes and culture led to the countries not seeing eye to eye.
With two years left of the war, the two allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and was fought for real, by replacement forces, on battlefields from America to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian front.
These plans became obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is clearly the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the sea.
The job of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, hindering the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most recent examples worth noting of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans tried to move men and material across the Atlantic to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic, mainly with the help of submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Great Britain in addition to the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
One started animal husbandry in ancient cultures to have easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Tamed goats were normally kept in herds that grazed on fields at high altitudes or other pasture areas, often watched over by shepherds who were often children or young people - a form of young shepherds. These methods of herding are still used today.
Railway tracks made of wood were built in England as early as the 1500s.
Even though these roads consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they made it possible for the horses pulling the wagons to achieve higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads that existed at that time.
Sleepers were introduced relatively early to keep the rails in place. But little by little, it was realized that the rails became more effective if they were spiked with a little iron on top.
This became common, but the iron led to greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In the end, the three wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation is walking. The human, that is Homo erectus (the upright human), started walking upright two million years ago.
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not regularly walk upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to be kinder to the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future burdens to some extent.
This is in many cases the same as treating symptoms. But if we not only want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and solve them that way.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humans. And problems have become greater due to overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle among humans.
After the Congress adopted the declaration on July 4th, a handwritten draft was signed by the president of the Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, and sent a few blocks away to the printing press of John Dunlap.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in front of Independence Hall on July 8th.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read the document to the troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 "Dunlap broadsides" we still know exist are the oldest copies of the document that have survived. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are living today. We call them birds.
Many do not think about them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But the birds have many similarities with dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs just like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always easy to detect. The symptoms (such as vomiting) can be so diffuse that it is not possible to make a diagnosis right away.
The best indication of internal poisoning is an open pillbox or toxic household chemicals left out.
Check the label to find out what kind of first aid to give for the specific substance.
In a formal sense, entomologists use the term "insect" for this group of insects.
This concept stems from old knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to being parasites on humans.
Both fleas and bedbugs are nidicolous animals, adapted to living in the nest or house of the host.
In the USA, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, meaning the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
According to research, women have twice the chance of getting MS as men.
A couple can decide that it is not the best for them, or the best for the child, to raise a baby.
These parents can choose to adopt out the baby.
In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can become parents to the child.
The main goal of science is to figure out how the world works, through the scientific method. This method serves as a guideline for most of the scientific research.
But not only this. Experimentation is also used. An experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible, in Latin.
Aristotle's view on everything related to science was what was accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek decreased, the West was torn away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and the production of these through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to oscillate with periods of free-running cycles, even when there are no external signals present.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading theories that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments where they either tagged the DNA in the cell with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the cell with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the targeted genetic material, and whether the targeted cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to see the beautiful landscape, including plant and animal life.
Example of activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
Another example is to visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people take the car and leave the small suburbs to travel to work, while others pass them on their way to work at the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation back and forth, everyone is in a way connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
The research now indicates that this massive CO2 economy has disrupted the biosphere from the stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In island countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems provoke so many complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental at play?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because one cannot predict driver behavior one hundred percent accurately.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably stable range. Thus, traffic flows are often somewhat stable and can be roughly represented mathematically.
There is established a relationship between the three main characteristics to better represent traffic flow: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These conditions are useful when planning, designing, and using road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to start flying. The ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid enemies, and they found food and mates faster.
Most insects have an advantage in that they can fold their wings backwards along their body.
This makes it so that they have more small places to choose from when they need to hide from predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings are horseflies and mayflies.
Many thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some believed him, but many believed the opposite, that it was the solar system moving around the earth, including the sun (and all other stars).
It's not so strange, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on earth. It has more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, in some places 9.5 km wide.
20 percent of all the water running out of all the earth's rivers and into the ocean comes from the Amazon River.
The main stem of the Amazon river is 6387 km long. It gathers water from thousands of small rivers.
Even though pyramid building in stone continued all the way to the end of the old kingdom, no one ever managed to surpass the pyramids in Giza in terms of size and outstanding technical execution.
Old Egyptians in the new kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has a population of around 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the daily language used by most who work in the state, while Latin is often used during religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these exist in natural form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These four elements were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Even though he also created a theory that they change into new substances and form what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. And of course, we also have the metals silver and gold.
You can also have alloys consisting of small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
An atom is so extremely small that there is room for many billions of them in the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was therefore a good friend for many when it was invented.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been downgraded to a lower status and used less as newer writing methods have been introduced.
People now write messages on computer screens and never need a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes up.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to assemble a core with many protons and neutrons.
A little like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When then dividing the core again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they often fall apart with little or no impact.
The surface of the moon consists of rocks and dust. We call the outer layer of the moon the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the farthest side.
She is thinner under the dark areas and thicker under the light areas.
There may be several cracks on the nearest side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around finding out what motivates people, or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as we grow older.
The theories consider what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they want, and what it is in their environment that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can occur when leaders start to lead colleagues they were previously on the same level with. At one end of the spectrum, you have the leader who tries to maintain being "one of the gang".
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, reprimanding employees, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you have the leader who becomes a person you no longer recognize, and who feels that he or she must change everything the group has been doing, and make it their own.
In the end, it is the leader who is responsible for both the highs and lows in the group.
This behavior often results in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams maintain the same superior standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual group members often serve as a point of contact for the closest physical group.
They often control themselves more independently than conventional group members because their groups often meet across different time zones, something that may not be met with understanding from the local leadership.
The fact that the group is truly "invisible" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109), is also a unique component of a virtual group.
The "invisible group" is the leadership group that each of the members reports to. The invisible group sets the standards for each individual member.
Why should an organization go through such a time-consuming process as establishing a learning organization? One of the goals to achieve by implementing organizational learning concepts in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in all the functional departments of an organization, creativity and productivity can thrive.
A result of this process with an organization collaborating to address a barrier is that it leads to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can become innovative, the leadership must establish a culture of innovation in addition to shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area is thus narrowed down and much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
New technologies allow us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that can help us understand processes in the brain.
Even though "science fiction" gives strong associations to artificial intelligence (AI), AI constitutes a very important part of computer science when it comes to dealing with functionality, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
An example of this can be control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and questions from customers, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
These things have become separate disciplines focusing on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in economics, medicine, technology, and the military and is built into several PC and video game apps.
Excursions are a big part of all teaching. It is quite often that a teacher would like to take the students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual excursions. Students can view museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
Every year, for example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about the trip to the largest city in the state. Every year they rebuild the website, but keep old versions online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students become better at writing. Even though students often start blogging with poor grammar and spelling, it usually changes when they have an audience.
Since students often are the most critical audience, the blogger starts to strive to make their writing better to avoid criticism.
Blogging also makes "students forced to understand the world around them better." The need to satisfy the audience inspires students to become smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn outside of the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to material on the internet, students can define their positions in the context of others' texts and outline their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada where they speak two languages. Here you will also find a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's history and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and the northern part houses, among other things, the untapped and scenic Muskoka.
All this and more emphasizes Ontario as what foreigners see as most typically Canadian.
Large areas further north have quite scattered settlements, and some areas are almost wilderness.
Here is a comparison that surprises many: There live more African Americans in the USA than there are inhabitants in Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a separate continent when it comes to animal and plant life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are linked to France, and known as luxury holiday destinations with beautiful beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it had a great impact on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism started in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
In the north, the regions are connected by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 9th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but left it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the city was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established a trading post there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, including tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes, and a whole range of trinkets, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in Congo located far east towards the border of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, and most of the buildings, especially in the city center, were covered in lava.
It is relatively safe in Goma, but if you are traveling outside of Goma, you must carefully investigate to find out the situation in the North Kivu province with regard to the ongoing conflict there.
The city is also used as a base camp for those who are going to climb the Nyiragongo volcano, and it is also the starting point for those who want to take one of the cheapest tours in Africa to see mountain gorillas.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with the fact that it is relatively difficult to access, "Timbuktu" is often used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today Timbuktu is a city with a lot of poverty, even though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, the town was added to the World Heritage List for endangered sites, due to the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the major stops on Henry Louis Gates' program, Wonders of the African World, which aired on the channel PBS.
The city stands in strong contrast to the cities in the rest of the country, as it is more Arabic than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River forming the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with different wildlife and plant life.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa, and it is seen as the flagship of South African national parks (SANParks).
In common with all South African national parks, the park has nature conservation fees and entrance fees.
It can also be wise to purchase a Wild Card, which provides free entry to either selected parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place many tourists see as the main goal of their visit.
The parade of buildings that make up the silhouette of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering bar chart revealed by the water in Victoria Harbour.
You get the best view of Hong Kong if you leave the island and take a trip to the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the slopes along the northern coastline.
This was the place the British colonizers took as their own, so if you want to see evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, and it stretches 80 km into the inland of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans is on UNESCO's World Heritage List. The part of the forest located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps. They encompass some of the last remaining stands of the vast jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², and approximately one third is covered with water/marshland.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a reserve for animals and plants, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axis deer in the area.
Buses run from the bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, even though most people, especially those heading east towards Jakar/Bumthang, travel between 06.30 and 07.30.
Since these buses between the districts are often full, it is wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts have small Japanese Coaster buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It stretches over the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011 and did not open for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017. It is expected that the Brazilian customs controls will be completed by then.
The Guaraní people were the most important ethnic group living in what is now called East Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture as a livelihood.
In the Chaco region, other indigenous groups like guaycurú and payaguá were also found, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay arose, previously called "The Giant Province of Indies," as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards started the colonization period that lasted for three hundred years.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of the distinctiveness and identity of the indigenous people.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place at the polo fields in Las Cañitas in December.
At other times of the year, one can see tournaments and matches on a smaller scale.
Contact Asociación Argentina de Polo to find out more about tournaments and where you can buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP) with a fixed exchange rate to the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, in Stanley, on the other side of the FIC West store.
British pounds are usually accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and American dollars are also often accepted.
In the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted. Contact the owners in advance to find out what is an approved payment method.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland pounds outside the islands, so you should do this before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo lies south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and during the summer months it is common to have temperatures above +30 °C.
The winter can be deceptively cold. The temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and high humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no specific "rainy" or "dry" seasons. It is about the same amount of rain all year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild, and one should not feed or disturb the animals.
The parks department asks you to stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may appear, both bison, deer, moose, bears and most large animals can attack.
Every year, many visitors are injured because they have not kept a good enough distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them the space they need.
In addition, you must be aware that smell attracts bears and other animals. Therefore, you should avoid bringing or cooking food that smells, and the camp must be kept clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, a special situation arose at the harbor when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave.
All the ships sank, except for a British sailing warship. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of the leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
As a result of Auckland stretching between two harbors, there are many beaches there. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The northern coastal beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located by the Pacific Ocean, and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches with safe swimming conditions, and most also have shade from Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located by Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are occasionally overcrowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The local beer is called "Number One" and is not a complex beer, but good and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to get hold of, but New Zealand and Australian wines will probably be a better choice.
Water from the tap is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to come by if you want to be on the safe side.
A "flat white" will be foreign to an Australian. A small black coffee is espresso, a cappuccino is served with lots of whipped cream (not milk foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate often meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but good.
There are many trips to the reef arranged throughout the year, and it is rare for the reef to get damaged as a result of this.
It is nevertheless wise to follow the advice from the authorities and to obey all signs and warnings.
One can find cube jellyfish near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the small town of 1770. Occasionally, they can also be found at other times of the year.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean. Their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
By ordering in advance, travelers can be assured that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
The travel agency often has agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as a campsite, through a travel agency.
The travel agency usually offers package tours that include breakfast and transportation to and from the airport, and sometimes combined flight and hotel packages.
It is also possible to keep the reservation if you need time to think over the offer or arrange other documents for the destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or inquiries should be sent to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most participants choose to camp at the festival, and most participants think this is an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to what's happening, you have to come early to get a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage has ended, there may be other places at the festival where music is played until late at night.
Some festivals have their own camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, you should check where your cabin is located. Some people can hear it extra well when the vessel passes through the ice. It makes a lot of noise.
A cruise to St. Petersburg gives you some time in the city. There is no requirement for a visa for cruise passengers (check the terms).
The casino does everything they can to make sure the guests spend as much time and money there as possible. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and it can be difficult to find the way out.
There are often special prices on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and stay.
Some places offer free drinks with alcohol, but as is well known, intoxication weakens judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to keep oneself sober.
Everyone who is going to drive at higher latitudes or over mountain passes must know that they may encounter snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and you cannot drive the same way as on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can come in a short time that you can get stuck.
The visibility may also become worse due to the snow falling or blowing onto the windshield, or when condensation or ice forms on the car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snow-covered conditions are common in many countries, and the traffic is mostly uninterrupted all year round.
Safari is perhaps the biggest travel attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
In popular use, the term safari refers to travels on land to see the amazing African wildlife, particularly on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to walk close to the cars, and standard equipment will provide a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes a little shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "footing") includes walks that can last for several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in different parts of Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as they also hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the games were postponed, it can be difficult.
The cancellation rules vary, but from the end of March, most cancellation rules based on the coronavirus do not apply until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets are expected to cost between 2500 JPY and 130,000 JPY, with the most common tickets costing around 7000 JPY.
Damp clothes can become drier if you iron them. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, even if you don't always find these in the room.
If you can't borrow an iron, or if you don't want to use wrinkled socks, you could try using a hairdryer.
Be careful so that the fabric does not get too hot (which can cause the fabric to shrink or, in the worst case, create scorch marks).
There are different ways to clean water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil the water for one minute, while in others you have to boil it for several minutes.
The filter efficiency varies, and if you don't feel completely confident, you may consider buying bottled water with a seal from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests they are not familiar with back home.
Pests can ruin food, be irritating, or in the worst case cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force, normally do not qualify as pests.
At duty and tax-free trade, one can buy goods exempt from customs duties and taxes at certain places.
Travelers on their way to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers very challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, and one must often drive through deserted forest areas.
If you are not used to driving on highways, you must keep a cool head when encountering steep inclines, narrow roadways, and sharp turns, which are typical for this stretch.
The speed limits are noticeably lower than on earlier and later road stretches, usually 56–64 km/h (35–40 mph), and it is even more important than usual to follow these.
Strangely enough, the mobile coverage is much better here than in many other stretches along the route, for example, Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite powerful and varied, in the same way as with the neighbor to the south, Austria.
Baked goods with fruit are common, where apples are added to baked goods year-round, while cherries and plums are used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Such popular cakes usually go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small, but powerful pastry, you can try what, depending on the area you are in, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Career is based on herbs and spices mixed with either meat or vegetables.
A career can either be "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry dishes. In South India and some other coastal areas on the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a range of regional dishes found across the country.
But if one uses it without further characteristics, the concept generally refers to food that originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island Java.
The Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago and offers a variety of simple and spiced dishes. The most dominant flavors that the Javanese people prefer are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups provide support to the rider's feet, which hang down on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but this can be a safety risk, because the feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider gets thrown off a horse, but his foot gets caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse takes off. A number of safety measures can ensure to minimize this risk.
First of all, most riders use riding boots with a heel and a smooth and fairly narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, also have a safety mechanism that allows a stirrup to release from the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a rider who is about to fall off.
The Cochamó Valley - the foremost climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many large granite walls and cliffs.
The summits offer a fantastic view. Climbers from large parts of the world continuously create new routes in the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Downhill skiing and snowboarding are popular sports where one slides down snow-covered terrain on skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan the entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
The idea behind skiing is very ancient. Cave paintings illustrating skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Slalom as a sport goes all the way back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpack tourism on skis: This is also called wilderness ski tours, cross-country trips or mountain ski tours.
The activity is related to, but normally does not involve randonee skiing trips in the high mountains or ski touring in steep terrain, which requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail you are going through as if it were a long hike on foot.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover greater distances than if you walk, but very rarely does it go as fast as cross-country skiing in groomed trails without a heavy backpack on your back.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but has many independent states. Usually when one is traveling through multiple countries, one must go through visa applications and passport controls multiple times.
But the Schengen area functions almost like one country in this context.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross borders without going through multiple passport controls.
If you have a Schengen visa, it works in the same way. You don't need to apply for a visa to each of the Schengen countries separately, and thereby save time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured goods are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods that are more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, and the age limit may be lower in e.g. North America compared to Europe.
One can define handicraft products as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture surrounding the activity is also important for many with other occupations.
Traditionally, not all Sami have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and they have mostly used reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, i.e. Sameland.
Although it is widely used, especially by people other than the Roma, the word "gypsy" is often seen as offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma.
If travel advisories have been issued for the country you are visiting, this could affect your health insurance or cancellation insurance.
It can also be wise to check what advice is available from other authorities than your own, but remember that their advice is intended for their residents.
American citizens in the Middle East may, for example, encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The council is just a brief summary of the political situation in the country.
What is presented here is often straightforward, general, and simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the generic term for all dangerous weather phenomena that can lead to damage, serious societal consequences, or loss of life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, extreme precipitation, and fire are forms of and effects of extreme weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena include heavy snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers should also keep themselves informed about the risk of bad weather affecting the area, as this may impact travel plans.
Everyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
With a search on the internet for "Hostile environment course" or "conflict management course," you will likely find the address of a local company.
A course usually covers the situations that are discussed here, in more detail, and usually with practical exercises.
A course normally lasts 2-5 days and involves role play, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapon training.
There are several books and magazines about how to survive in the wilderness, but there are few publications about war zones.
Travelers planning to have gender-correcting surgeries abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of the authorities to issue passports without a specified gender (X) or documents that are updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
In addition, it varies how willing authorities abroad are to accept these documents.
Searches in security checks have also become far more intrusive in the time after September 11, 2001.
Before the surgery, trans people may not expect to come through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Outgoing currents are currents of water from waves that have broken against the beach, and which withdraw, often at reefs and the like.
Due to the underwater topography, the return current is concentrated in a few deeper corridors, and here a fast current can form towards deeper waters.
Most die from exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, it's not more difficult to swim back than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught in the current again. Alternatively, depending on what you can handle, and if someone has spotted you, it might be wise to wait for someone to rescue you.
Unexpected culture shock can come faster than culture shock (fewer days to get used to the new culture), and this can last longer and be more intense.
Those who have been traveling and have had an easy time adapting to the new culture, may have had an extra hard time adapting to their own culture again.
When they come home after living abroad, they have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits they had before.
When they traveled abroad, people were probably patient and accommodating in the beginning, since it takes some time for travelers to adapt to a new country.
Not everyone may be equally patient and welcoming when the travelers come back home, but this is just as important.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most exciting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in the quiet before the show starts.
Usually, you hear the sound of tourists and sellers. The story of the sound and the light is like a history book.
The sphinx forms a backdrop and stands as the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are lit up.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations. They have the most stations, with sixteen of them being active in 2020.
The island group is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
The other includes Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular and natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the peninsula and borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on this side of the peninsula merge into the plateau, but reappear later to form a 360 km long mountain range in the form of the Ellsworth Mountains, where Minnesota Glacier occurs.
The northern part, Sentinel Range, has the highest mountain in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, which has a peak that rises 4892 meters above sea level.
In remote areas where there is no mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only alternative.
A satellite phone is usually not a good replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is often used within shipping, including leisure craft, and during expeditions that require external data and communication services.
The local provider of telephone services should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among school students who have completed a study program and can take a gap year before starting university, without it affecting their education.
In many cases, a course abroad during the gap year can give you better chances to pursue higher education in your home country.
Usually, one must pay a tuition fee to enroll in such educational programs.
Finland is a great boat destination. "The land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are definitely large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak for a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seventh or eighth person.
This is similar to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example, the number in the Netherlands is one in forty).
Most common cruise tours in the Baltic have a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for two full days, but you go back and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore when participating in excursions arranged on the tour, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009 onwards).
Some cruises include Berlin in Germany in the brochures. As you can see on the map, Berlin is not close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
It can be scary to travel by plane for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced something traumatic.
There is nothing to be ashamed of. It is not unlike fear and aversion to other things, as many people have.
For some, understanding more about how planes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear based on the unknown or lack of control.
The courier company gets paid well for delivering things quickly. Time often means a lot when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes, the major companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, this was a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, it could have taken several days for unloading and customs clearance on some routes.
The only thing that worked to get them through faster was to send them as checked baggage. The airline's regulations do not allow for sending baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
Just cough up a pile of bills (or even better, get your company to do it for you) if you want to fly first class or business class.
This is not cheap, and as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the regular economy class price for business class, and eleven times more for first class.
There is generally no point in searching for cheap tickets for business class or first class on direct flights from A to B by plane.
The airlines know that there is a specific group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot to be able to travel quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic where there have been many ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Transnistria Republic in eastern Moldova with its own government and currency. But it is not recognized by any of the UN member states.
Economic cooperation has been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite failures in the political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of around 3.7 million. The city has the second largest port after Istanbul and is a very good transportation hub.
What once was the ancient city of Smyrna, is now a modern, developed and bustling commercial city center surrounding a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide streets, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers have traditional red roof tiles, a square from the 18th century, and old mosques and churches, even though the city's atmosphere is more influenced by Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village Haldarsvík has a view of the island Eysturoy, which lies nearby, and has an exceptionally octagonal church.
In the churchyard, you can see interesting marble sculptures of doves on some gravestones.
It is worth taking a stroll around the captivating village for half an hour.
To the north and within reasonable distance lies the romantic and fascinating village of Sintra. The town became known to foreigners when Lord Byron brilliantly conveyed how magnificent it was here.
The Scotturb bus no. 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north you can visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (holy place), where Mary revealed herself several times, stories that are known all over the world.
Remember that you are simply visiting a mass grave and a place that means infinite much to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who are alive today and survived the time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked themselves to death here, both Jews and others.
The place deserves to be shown dignity, awe, and respect. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not destroy the place by drawing or writing on the buildings.
The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefer to speak Catalan, the majority understand it, and nearly everyone can speak Spanish.
Most signs, however, are only in Catalan, because according to the law it is the official first language.
But Spanish is also widely used in connection with public transportation and other services.
Regular announcements on the metro are only made in Catalan, while unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Even though it is often a misunderstood stereotype, one will fare best in Paris by behaving in the best possible way, as someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). Then it will be much easier to get around.
A seemingly brusque exterior quickly disappears among Parisians if you are basically polite.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park contains a lot of forest, mainly beech, spruce, and conifers, and has a mix of alpine vegetation and Mediterranean vegetation.
He has a particularly wide range of plant communities due to the spectrum of microclimates, different soils, and varying elevation levels.
In the area, you will also find an extremely large variety of animal and bird species.
Here you will find rare fauna such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and grouse, along with many more common species.
Women visiting the monastery must wear skirts that cover the knees, and the shoulders must also be covered.
Most of the monasteries lend shawls to women who have not thought about this. But if you bring your own, especially one with light colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Men must wear pants that cover the knees.
This is also possible to borrow from the collection at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable using them. The sizes fit all men!
The Majorcan kitchen, like in similar areas in the Mediterranean, often uses a lot of bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) in addition to olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli. This is bread with olive oil, tomato, and available flavorings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns in addition to the word Sie (you formal) always start with a capital letter, even if it is in the middle of a sentence.
In this way, it is easier to distinguish between individual verbs and objects.
It also makes reading easier, even though writing is somewhat complicated because one must figure out whether a verb or adjective is used in a nominal form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to keep an eye on are c and g, since the pronunciation varies based on the vowel that comes after.
Be sure to also pronounce r and rr differently: Caro means dear, while carro means cart.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, this introduction to grammar can teach you a lot about Persian grammar and how you can better understand sentences.
If you can speak a Romance language, it will naturally be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But it is easy for those who know some Spanish to quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that you don't need to study it separately.
Observatories built before modern times are largely obsolete today and remain as museums or educational buildings.
Since light pollution was not a problem at that time, we usually find them in cities or on university campuses where they are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Today's modern research telescopes are often huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the preferred flowers.
In Japan, the first celebrations of cherry blossom were arranged by the emperor, and they were only for him and other members of the aristocracy in the emperor's court.
Plants look best when they are in a natural environment, so don't succumb to the temptation to "just take one" specimen.
If you are visiting a formal garden, "taking a sample" will definitely be a reason to show you out.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, and it is easy to get around. You can also get hold of almost anything once you have arrived.
But when you live in a tropical climate just a few degrees north of the equator, you must cope with both heat (continuously) and strong sun (when it is cloudless, which is more rare).
There are also some buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you want to take goes all the way to Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba.
Waterways in the inland can be nice to base the vacation trip on.
You can for example visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to interesting places along the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They are also the starting point for popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world have adopted many of the holiday traditions.
It is a tradition to stay up on Easter night and watch the sunrise outdoors.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could just as well be a spring and fertility ritual with roots in pre-Christian times.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening during Easter, where the congregation often breaks into the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that originally came to the islands, came swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, the mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since humans came to the Galapagos, several mammals have arrived, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the arctic or antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, where the sun does not rise above the horizon.
Then there are good conditions for seeing the northern lights, since the sky is dark more or less all day.
Since the population is spread out over the areas and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to see the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what people from the West are used to.
Dress is standard business attire, and the employees address each other by last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, and emphasis is placed on group effort instead of praise for individual performances.
The employees often need approval from their superiors for all decisions to be made, and it is expected that they follow instructions from their superiors without questioning.
