This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already well accepted, but also offers details that are not found as often in fossils, such as colors and the three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the upper plumage of this animal was brown and the lower part was light or carotenoid.
The discovery also provides clues about the evolution of feathers in birds.
The dinosaur feathers, known as rachis, do not have a well-developed shaft, but they have other characteristics, such as barbs and barbules. As a result, researchers concluded that the rachis was possibly the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for display or regulating temperature. Researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample has the plumage of an adult, not that of a hatchling.
The researchers suggested that, despite the tail being from a young dinosaur, the sample reveals adult plumage, not fuzz.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.
The governor's office stated that 19 of the injured were police officers.
The police informed that they suspect the person responsible for the attack to be a supposed militant of Daesh (ISIL).
They discovered that the sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system was determined by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to define the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is with regard to magnetic inversions.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on Earth, causing the tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matters in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo around the galaxy and is composed of various tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He warned that the new variant was "very worrisome and alarming due to the high mortality rate" in an interview.
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital and at least two were healthcare professionals.
In the span of one year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.

Millions of vials of encephalitis vaccine were also promised by the government, which will help prepare health agencies for the next year.
The plans for vaccines that were supposed to be given to historically more affected areas this year were delayed due to a lack of funds and low prioritization compared to other diseases.

Glen Cushing, from the Astrogeology Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the University of Northern Arizona, located in Flagstaff, Arizona, stated, "Its thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on planet Earth, which usually preserve a fairly constant temperature, but is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground."
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and deposit a pre-printed sheet indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral legislation codifies the procedures in a very rigorous manner.
Since 1988, voting ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that no ballot is present at the beginning of the vote and that no ballot is added, except for those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe all parts of the process. During the night, votes are counted by volunteers under careful supervision, following specific procedures.

His first event was the Slalom, where he received a "Did Not Finish" (DNF) in his first race. 36 out of 116 competitors obtained the same result in the race.
Your other race, the Giant Slalom, obtained the tenth position in the seated women's group with a combined result of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 slower than the first-placed Australian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers from the group were unable to finish their races, and 45 out of 117 female skiers in the Giant Slalom were unable to qualify in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and cellphone.
The Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered her cell phone and laptop."
The accused were named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The accused appeared in court with his face covered, said police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki.
Despite three people being inside the house when it was hit by the car, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital, in Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court ever since, accused of the murder of her son.
She is in custody while awaiting indictment and trial, but any evidence from eyewitnesses may be compromised because her image was widely circulated.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish judiciary operates in a distinct way, and the courts consider the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, observes that "journalists seem to be heading in a dangerous direction when they publish photos, videos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the processes, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made, at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute that Palestine wants based on the borders before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to leave that presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control test were closely supervised by the forest engineers while the test was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
Qualified volunteers were recruited, according to the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association, in a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage at NPWS Park, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Yesterday, Martelly promised a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the prior resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to advance the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the general protests organized against the regime. The demonstrations began in October.
The occasionally violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been scheduled since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods with overheating issues have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) said it is aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI disclosed that Apple had informed them of 34 more incidents of overheating, which the company classified as "non-serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's report delay "truly regrettable".
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time. In GMT time, it was on Friday at 21:19.
The Northern Mariana Islands' emergency management office said there were no reported damages in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there is no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held the tourists hostage in Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle against the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were freed earlier, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Afterwards, the photographers took the place of an elderly lady who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Although he was working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births in his spare time.
Your research showed that, if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes," flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid homage to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night with two moons. Something exceptional, just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin Goldust Runnels said, "Luna was as crazy as I was... or maybe even more... I loved her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal elections, the percentage of those opposed to the change in Australia, to become a republic, grew by 8% since 2008.
The acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated, during the 2010 campaign for the national election, that she believed Australia would become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those who participated in the survey share this view, wishing that Queen Elizabeth II be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of the respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was put into question.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain, as they are prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different types of hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets have been a source of water distribution to the earth along with organic matter that can develop proteins and make life possible.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his government at the beginning of this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "politics and nonsense"
It is speculated that he will run for presidency in 2016.
The NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
He uses satellite-based technology in contrast to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and provide more precise information to pilots.
There will be no extra transportation and surface trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking and connections with public transportation will not be available.
The problem of lack of transportation increased the possibility of the game having to be held behind closed doors, without the presence of the fan.
On Thursday, the magazine Science published a study reporting the discovery of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer, due to the reproduction between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in any form. It can even be rolled into small shapes.
It can be stretched to form a thin wire, which can then be twisted and braided. It can also be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be very thin and glued to another metal. Because it's so thin, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted frames in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called chemical pH. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
The hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders and, with clean hands, shape them into a ball.
The moisture from the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a kind of shell.
The city of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, frequented by both men and women.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then redirects it back, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
A giant rocket over 30 meters high is necessary to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel did for us was to give us much easier and faster transportation.
He gave us the train, the car, and several other forms of transportation.
Below them are the medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray pets) that eat much more numerous small animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of niche, a special function that each cat performs that prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called prides.
The herds consist of one to three adult males from the same family, along with up to 30 females and offspring.
Women tend to be intimately related to each other, forming a great family of sisters and daughters.
Packs of lions act similarly to groups of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the roar of a lion at full voice, but more like a phrase of shouted and growled words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They capture monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that jaguars follow and find their prey by smell, sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and can also move stealthily. Jaguars hunt their prey by blending in with the surrounding environment and then attacking their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population where they came from (for example, they cross a mountain range or a river, or go to an island from which it is not easy to return), often they find themselves in a different environment than the one they inhabited before.
This new environment has different resources and new competitors, so the new population will need to acquire different characteristics from the ones it already possesses and adapt in order to become a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
With the passing of time, as the new population starts to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less similar to the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
The plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants use the sun as their food through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses using plants and make our clothes using plants. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The Mosasaur was the alpha predator of its era, therefore, the only thing it feared were other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of the mouth, showing that nothing that crossed its path could escape.
We are not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex wouldn't stand a chance against him.
Although most of their foods were familiar to us, the Romans still had their share of strange or uncommon foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called an arganaz.
Another difference was that, while the poor and women ate sitting in chairs, the rich men enjoyed hosting banquets together where they lay down on their side while eating their meals.
The diet in ancient Rome did not include foodstuffs originating from America and Asia to Europe, as happened in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomato, nor potato, nor cacao, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for each of their gods, which were considered the house of their respective god.
The people would bring sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would seek to meet the needs of these gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary in which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramids in the shape of towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The majority of Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard, the shops were just open counters facing the street. Stones were used in the construction of the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was colonized in a scattered manner. In the Nordic sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, when traveling to the west, found Greenland and gave it that name.
But, regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although all of the countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text appears in the bottom corner of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that, in the beginning of its existence, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
In this way, it is likely that a note was simply added as a label.
The landings and subsequent battles on D-Day liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the "Vichy" French. They were French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and also, in some way, defines the size of the society.
The city-states are the precursors of nations. The culture of civilization involves the transmission of knowledge through different generations, a lasting cultural reach, and a fair dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving proper historical evidence and are no longer recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to demand taxes and, due to the absence of a national executive or judiciary, relied on state authorities, which generally did not cooperate, to enforce all of its laws.
Furthermore, there was no authority to revoke fiscal laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states paid so little attention to the central government that their representatives were almost never present.
The Italian football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
The popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographic position, as an "archipelago"
The foundation of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when Europeans sailing through the region named the area as Ilha Formosa.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company inaugurated a base in southwest Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the practices of producing indigenous grains and employing Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it cedes sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governs the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally were.
In the year 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was recovered, and this recovery continues to this day.
As an example, the most common form of static image photography on the planet is 35mm, which was the most widely circulated film size at the end of the analog film era.
Currently, it is still being produced, but the most important thing is that its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, in a confusing way, 36mm wide by 24mm tall.
The screen ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the smallest ratio between whole numbers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are either equal to or very close to this ratio.
The quite abused and often demoralized third party law is a fairly simple guideline that provides dynamics while maintaining a relative order in a figure.
According to him, the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example) is the most effective place for the main subject.
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states, despite the differences in language and customs.
Everyone was affected by his influential power, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are specifically there for that reason.
The central leadership of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, with the cutting off of vital supplies to military and civilians, although this blockade violated generally accepted international regulations and was stipulated in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire areas of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral-flagged ships.
Germany, once there was limited response to this tactic, was expecting a similar attack to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the predominant attitudes of the majority of citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wished to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with not a penny to his name, a book of poetry, and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of demonstrating different periods; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, between each dynasty there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the time of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war occurred between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit on the throne of the great Xi'an palace.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, following the Revolution, positions were opened to all male candidates, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since instead of ranks being based on social class, they were now based on character.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people from the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira'" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the times, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's religious inclinations.
Resting at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find it, even if one knows that it exists. Once inside the cave, it is total isolation.
It is not possible to see anything but the clear blue sky above and the surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many great pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, features several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), various small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upward-pointing arch" mark has a similar appearance to a V, and the "downward-pointing arch" mark has a similar appearance to a staple or a square without the bottom side.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow; down means you should start at the heel (which is where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
In general, an upward bow produces a softer sound, while a downward bow produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
You can write your own notes, but don't forget that the printed bow notes exist for a musical reason, so these should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, eleven years old, and Louis Charles, four years old) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and screaming threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a protester waved the head of a dead royal guard in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino population themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest on floating-rate bonds on behalf of the Filipino government through Wall Street banks.
It is clear that the superprofits originating from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which such events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history between the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a series of ideas in practice, from the supply of technology or technological imperative to a strict notion that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share 2 general ideas: the first is that technological development follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence; the second is the idea that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone may argue that the car necessarily results in the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The possession of cars in mass leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the healthcare system to heal the injured bodies.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
The geography, in the context of Romanticism, caused citizens to be shaped and, over time, customs and culture linked to this geography emerged, which, being in harmony with the society's place, became better than the potentially mandatory laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of the contemporary fashion world, Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Your status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the participants of the Crusade returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic language reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and also in the 14th century.
In the beginning, the clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the Eastern region.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began developing its own style. One of the biggest advancements for the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to fasten their clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmers and their families.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, usually organic, that uses native seeds from the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, the majority of farmers have been involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in most developing nations.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar mindsets who feel neglected by society's norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
The subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to refer to the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults as they were growing up.
These children are called "ferocious" or wild. Some of these children have been confined by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of these children occurred due to the rejection of the child by the parents because of their severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children who are rebellious may have suffered serious traumas or abuse in childhood, before being abandoned or running away from home.
It is assumed that others were created by animals; some are said to have lived on their own in the jungle.
When completely raised by animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to that of the particular pet animal, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method takes it a step further.
The scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a support for students who are going through a new learning experience, like using a new computer or starting a new project.
The scaffolds can be virtual or in person, in other words, a teacher can be considered a scaffold, just like that little talking paperclip from Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software with the objective of questioning, alerting, and explaining procedures that may be challenging for the student to handle alone.
The children are placed in foster homes for a multitude of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that does not nourish, care for and educate, but it happens.
We see the Family Support System as a safety zone for these children.
Our adoption platform has the duty to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, regular education, and guaranteed medical care.
It is supposed that foster care meets all the needs that were missing in the home they were taken from.
The internet combines elements of both interpersonal and mass communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are indicated as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuity in relationships" were also identified as new characteristics of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to web pages.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
Particularly, it is claimed that a person can detect if another person is lying through the accurate interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such skills of interpreting human behavior can be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the 20th century concluded that there are two ways of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation and the selection removes it from the expressed variation pool.
The segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two bases with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans, consuming the available plant resources, to meet its amino acid requirements.
Furthermore, not acting accordingly results in severe consequences: severe depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The plant-based resources with greater accessibility would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for us primates to digest, unless they are cooked.
However, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide proteins in great quantity containing all essential amino acids.
Taking all this into account, it would not be surprising if our own ancestors have solved their "protein problems" more or less like current savanna chimpanzees do.
The interruption of sleep is a process that consists of intentionally waking up during the normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a somewhat quiet alarm clock to bring him to consciousness without fully waking him up.
If you find yourself hitting the snooze button while you sleep, try placing the alarm clock on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other possibilities based on biorhythm include drinking plenty of liquids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, as it forces the person to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace of a person correlates in an opposite way to their level of physical and spiritual tension.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they have been expanded by the path of love of Mahayana and by many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of comprehensive love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the kundalini energy (illuminating energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central part of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common villain in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to the disintegration of the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
The goal was to last for the next 40 years, and indeed there would be troop leadership in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already destroyed and the only way out was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move people and goods on a large scale across the oceans.
The work of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that their country maintains the ability to transport people and goods while at the same time interfering with their enemies' ability to move their own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the battle of the North Atlantic in World War II. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At that same moment, the organization of the German navy, mostly using U-boats, was trying to put an end to that traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have had the capability to conquer Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them in order to facilitate access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pasture areas, often tended by shepherds who were typically children or teenagers, similar to the better known shepherd. These herding methods are still used today.
The wagonways were built in England from the 16th century.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, this allowed horses to pull them to achieve higher speeds and carry heavier loads on slightly rougher roads.
Sleepers were implemented early on, to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a metal cover on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
Your predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
The adaptations for bipedalism are found in the fossils of Australopithecus dating between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago. However, Sahelanthropus may have walked upright, on two legs, much earlier, seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want to have only a temporary solution, we must find the origin of the problems and put an end to them.
It is obvious enough that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of the human race, and problems have become bigger because of overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of man.
After adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress president John Hancock and secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to a printing shop owned by John Dunlap.
During the night around 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap attacks".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon, in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
On July 6, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 surviving Dunlap copies are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have scales on their legs and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs, like a T-rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely, 0 or 1, and these numbers are classified as binary digits - or bits, using the language used in computing.
The internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The main sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container with medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions related to this particular poison.
The term "insects" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects well structured to stick to humans.
Both barbers and bedbugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in nests or shelters of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and adults.
The MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research showed that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis than men.
A couple can decide that raising a baby is not in their interest, or their child's.
Such couples have the permission to decide to make a plan to adopt the baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. It is this method that guides scientific research.
It is not, in fact, just experimentation; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, or to ask questions. Making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
All of Aristotle's scientific thoughts were accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek receded, the West found itself distant from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Several rhythms observed in physiology and behavior usually depend fundamentally on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not absolutely responses to external periodic stimuli, have been observed in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to function for a period of continuous cycle, even without the interference of the environment.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indicators that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase use phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments that labeled either the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
The natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including fauna and flora.
Examples of local activities include fishing, taking photographs, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, by car, people leave the small towns in the countryside to go work in other cities, and they come across other people who work precisely in those small towns they left.
In this dynamic transportation bus, everyone is in some way connected and supporting a car-based transportation system.
The science now points out that this carbon-based economy has disrupted the biosphere from the stable state that had allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone also complains about these transportation systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridge collapses are rarely heard.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic Flow is the analysis of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two different points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be mathematically represented.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established among the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Such relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and mayflies.
For thousands of years, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
Doesn't planet Earth seem like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest river and the second longest on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes nearly 10 km wide.
A total of 20% of the water that goes from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite the fact that the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical construction excellence.
The ancient of Egypt of the New Empire marveled at the constructions of their predecessors, which had up until then more than a thousand years.
The population of the Vatican City has about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
The Italian is also the common language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because all can be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements, which are earth, water, air, and fire.
That was more related to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
It is considered that elements such as calcium and potassium are metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also find alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
All things in the Universe are made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so astonishingly small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods appeared, the pencil became relegated to a less important role and use.
Currently, people write messages through computer screens and do not need to get close to a pointer.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something newer emerges.
The fission bomb operates based on the principle that it takes energy to build a core with multiple protons and neutrons.
It's sort of like pushing a heavy cart uphill. The splitting of the nucleus then releases some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to separate with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the invisible side.
The layer is thinner under the seas and thicker below the mountains.
There may be more magma on the closer side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they reach adulthood.
These theories analyze what is in certain people that makes them want what they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge as managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One side of the spectrum tries to remain as "part of the guys" (or girls) group.
That type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, conducting performance evaluations, delegating, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team has been doing and do their own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of a team.
This behavior often ends in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have to maintain the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, however, there are some subtle differences.
The members of the virtual team usually act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may be in different time zones, which may not be understood by local managements.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to whom each member must report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the difficult process of establishing organizational learning? One of the practical objectives of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used by all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity shine through.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome a difficulty can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies the Continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels in their performance.
The neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, they narrow the research area and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavioral patterns underpins scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before seen.
This gives us a lot of information and material to design simulation models that help us understand the processes that exist in our minds.
Despite AI having a strong connotation of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, addressing behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent activity.
The examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to address customer issues and diagnoses, as well as recognition of writing, voice, and speech.
These things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, as it is integrated into various home computer software applications and video games.
Study visits are very important for any school class. Often, teachers would love to take their students to places for which a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. From the classroom, students can see museum pieces, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students from Bennet School in North Carolina develop a website about their trip to the state capital. Every year, the website is remodeled, but previous versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Since students often start their contact with blogs using poor grammar and spelling, the presence of a general audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to make an effort to improve writing and avoid criticism.
In addition, having a blog "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to feed the public's interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing in blogs is a tool that inspires collaboration and motivates students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can make students more analytical and critical; by actively interacting with internet content, students can position themselves in the context of other people's writings, as well as define their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a number of art galleries and museums that showcase the Canadian past and present.
The Niagara Falls are further to the south; while the north has the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and much more.
Ontario stands out as what outsiders consider the essence of Canada, due to all of this and much more.
Large areas further north are also quite sparsely populated, and some are practically uninhabited by the nature.
For the purpose of comparing the population that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the US than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean, at a distance from the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent of its own when it comes to wildlife.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, which gained a lot of popularity in Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the route from Europe to India around the Cape.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their current marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to actions that they would consider as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men. Don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether it's due to cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it with the name of Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in Morocco as a whole.
Near the historic part of Medina, it is easy to find traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather items, hookahs, and a lot of other trinkets, all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the far east, near Rwanda.
In the year 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried a large part of the city's streets, especially the center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be carefully studied to understand the state of the ongoing battle in the Nord-Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest mountain trails with gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to go around Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a quick ride.
"Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor to refer to distant and exotic lands, given its relative inaccessibility.
Today, Timbuktu is a impoverished city despite its reputation making it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In the year 1990, it was placed on the list of world heritage sites at risk, due to the danger of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during the program Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates, broadcast on the PBS channel.
The city contrasts strongly with the rest of the country because it has more of an Arab touch than African.
The Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa, along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River on the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 Km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different animal species.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
There are fees for entry and conservation of the park, as with all national parks in South Africa.
It can also be very useful to acquire a Wild Card. With it, you can have access to various parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider as its main attraction.
The parade of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a shimmering bar chart that is made visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The majority of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers chose to live, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a great place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they have some of the last remaining large jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², with one-third of it being covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 deer spotted in the area.
There are several departure times for buses from the inter-district bus station (across the river) during the day, but most, especially those going to the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As the interdistrict buses are almost always crowded, it is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese coastal minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, in Brazil, and São Jorge do Oiapoque, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, have a length of 378 meters and two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011 and did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to start operating in September 2017, the expected date for completion of customs inspections in Brazil.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group that inhabited what is now the eastern part of Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicurus and the Paiaguás, who lived off hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as "The Giant Province of the Indies", emerged from the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with the native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards initiated the colonization period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has succeeded in maintaining many of its indigenous populations' characteristics and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and smaller matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
To stay updated on news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is generally accepted anywhere on the islands and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are accepted.
In remote islands, it is unlikely that credit cards will be accepted, although British and American currencies may be received. Please inquire with the owners in advance to find out what payment method they accept.
It's practically impossible to change the currency of the Falkland Islands outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
As Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there, while it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
The winter can be disappointingly cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make the sensation colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains basically the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to the presence of humans, they are still wild animals that should not be fed or disturbed.
Following the instructions of the park authorities, keep yourself at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
Despite their gentle appearance, bisons, moose, and bears, as well as all large animals, can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they didn't keep a proper distance. These animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so do not approach.
Furthermore, be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong smells and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a well-known naval stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, USA, and Great Britain refused to leave it.
All the ships were sunk, except for a cruiser from Great Britain. Nearly 200 German and American lives perished.
During the fight for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the assassination of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is situated between two bays. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the north coast (in the district of North Harbour) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many have shade from pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the sophisticated suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide variety of shops around the coast. Swimming is very safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One'. It is not a fancy beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to enjoy, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may go down better.
The local tap water is completely safe for consumption, but it is easy to find bottled water if you are concerned.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is strange. A short black coffee is "espresso", the cappuccino comes filled with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The natural juices are expensive, but great.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes, which occur in the reef, are rare.
Continue to follow the authorities' reminders, obeying all signs, and paying close attention to safety alerts.
The cubomedusa occurs near beaches and river estuaries, from October to April, north of 1770. They can occasionally be found at other times.
Sharks really exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and tend to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean. Their main habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives the traveler the peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often do business with specific hotels, although it's likely possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping parks, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even combined packages with flights and hotels.
They can also secure your booking if you need time to consider the offer or gather other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, if there are any changes or requests, these should be first directed to the travel agent, and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival participants decide to camp on site, and most of them consider it a fundamental part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive early to camp near the music.
Remember that, even after the main stage music ends, some sections of the festival may continue playing late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as when crossing the ice, a terrible noise is generated for the most sensitive.
The cruises in St. Petersburg include city tours. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (refer to terms).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by their visitors. In general, there are no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers for food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and to keep them on the premises.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages on the house. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of maintaining sobriety.
Whenever someone will drive in high latitude places or on mountain roads, they should take into consideration the possibility of facing snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and you cannot drive as if you were on clean asphalt.
During snowstorms, it is possible for enough snow to fall to leave you stranded in a very short time.
Visibility may also be reduced due to falling or blowing snow, or due to condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic remains almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the apple of many visitors' eyes.
The term "safari", in its colloquial usage, refers to land trips to observe the impressive African wildlife, mainly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach the cars and the basic equipment allows for good visualization.
The lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
Also known as "forest walk", "walking safari" or "hike", a walking safari is equivalent to walking, whether for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympic Games will take place between August 24th and September 5th, 2021. Some events will be hosted in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a tricky situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, most of the cancellation policies due to the coronavirus did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that the majority of tickets for the events will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels offer irons and ironing boards for loan, even if there isn't one in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you don't like to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause it to shrink or, in more severe cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, bringing the water to a boil for one minute is sufficient; in others, many minutes are necessary.
The quality of the filters varies and, if you're in doubt, it may be good to consider the possibility of buying water gallons from a trusted company.
Travelers can encounter animal pests with which they are not familiar in the regions they came from.
Pests can ruin food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
The very infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people through force, generally do not qualify as pests.
Duty free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods free of taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers visiting countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging conditions for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated backcountry areas.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be prudent: steep slopes, narrow tracks, and sharp curves are common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - commonly 55-65 km/h - and strict adherence to them is even more important than the opposite.
Interestingly, however, the cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as in Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German sweets are very good and, in Bavaria, they are well-made and varied, similar to those of the southern neighbor, Austria.
The sweets with fruits are frequent, with baked apples in the sweets all year long, and cherries and plums making an appearance during the summer.

If you want some small, but tasty, pastries, try what, depending on the region, may be called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, combined with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.

With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a range that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if used without other qualifiers, the term tends to mean that the food originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a variety of simply spiced dishes, with the predominant Javanese condiments being peanuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
For a rider's feet to have support, stirrups are used, which hang on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but they can present security issues, as the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a knight is thrown from a horse, but had one of his feet caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the animal ends up fleeing. To decrease this danger, various safety precautions can be taken.
First, a large portion of pilots wear riding boots with a heel and smooth sole, which is quite narrow.
Then, some saddles, mainly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to fall from the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Being Chile's main climbing destination, Cochamó Valley is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large cliffs and granite cliffs.

The sports practiced on snow, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding over snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard strapped to the feet.
Skiing is an important activity on the trip for many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski bums", who plan entire vacations just to ski in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century and in the year 1861, the first recreational skiing club was opened by citizens of Norway in Australia.
Ski touring: activity also known as backcountry skiing, touring skiing or ski mountaineering.
It is related, but generally does not involve tourism for alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a walking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover distances slightly larger than on foot - but only very rarely will you achieve cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to go through visa requests and passport control multiple times.
The Schengen area, however, functions as one country in this aspect.
If you stay in this area, it is possible to cross the border without going through passport control posts again.
In the same way, by possessing a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that specifies which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
The handmade products can be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
The breeding of reindeer is an important means of subsistence among the Sámi, and the culture around trade is also important for many other professional classes.
No matter how much of a tradition it may be, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but instead lived off fishing, hunting, and the like, with reindeers primarily used as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people work with modern businesses. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the term "gypsy" is often considered to be offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you will be visiting is subject to travel advisories, your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
It is also advisable for you to consult other governments besides your own, but their advice is intended for their respective citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may experience different situations from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is just a brief summary of the political situation in a nation.
The points of view presented are usually superficial, general, and simplified in relation to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruptions, or loss of human life.

Travelers are strongly advised to stay alert to any risk of bad weather in their region, as this can affect travel plans.
When planning a visit to a country that is considered a war zone, the person should first receive professional training.
A search on the internet for 'Hostile environment course' will usually indicate the address of a local company.
A course will typically cover all the topics discussed here with much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course generally lasts between 2 and 5 days and involves role-playing, various first aid techniques, and sometimes weapon training.
Books and magazines that deal with survival in the jungle are common, but publications about war zones are rare.
Travelers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an undefined gender (X), or updated documents to match a desired name and gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is widely variable.
The searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet had gender reassignment surgery should not expect to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Return currents are the water reflux from the waves on the beach returning to the sea, usually on a reef or similar area.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, and a fast current can form for deep waters there.
Most deaths result from fatigue of trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you manage to get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than it would usually be.
Try to aim from somewhere where you can’t be caught or, depending on your skills or if you have been detected, wait for rescue.
The reentry shock occurs sooner than the cultural shock (there is less time for the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapted to the new culture sometimes have a special difficulty readjusting to their native culture.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your local culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People do not realize that patience and understanding are also fundamental for travelers returning home.
In the area reserved for children, one of the most interesting things is the light and sound show of the pyramid.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and also in the silence before the show starts.
Normally you always hear the sound of tourists and sellers. The story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is defined as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the highest number of bases, with sixteen active until the year 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the village of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
The others are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, coastal to the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here merge into the plateau, then reemerge to form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, cut by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, reaching 4,892m at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations without cell coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a cell phone, since to make a call you need to be outdoors with a view of the satellite.
The service is often used for transportation, including recreational boats, as well as expeditions with remote data and voice needs.
Your local phone operator can provide more information about the connection to this service.
A increasingly popular option for those who intend to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular among those who are leaving school, allowing them to take a year off before university, without compromising their education.
In most cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can indeed increase your chances of entering higher education in your home country.
Usually, there will be an enrollment fee to sign up for these educational programs.
For those who enjoy boat trips, Finland is a great destination. In the lakes and coastal archipelagos, the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands.
In archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.

Sailing with a rowboat is a national pastime in Finland, with one rowboat for every seven or eight people.
That is coordinated by Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but in a quite characteristic way (for example, in the Netherlands, the number is from one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for two full days and return to the ship to sleep at night.
If you only embark on maritime excursions, you will not need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany, in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if those people have never traveled by plane before or have never gone through a traumatic event.

For some, understanding how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear based on the unknown or lack of control.
Transport companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important in sending commercial documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they shipped items by air freight, depending on the route, it may take days to reach the destination and go through customs.
The only way to get through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow for luggage to be sent without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is by shelling out a large amount of money for the privilege (or even better, having your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: as a basic rule, you can expect to pay up to four times more for the business class and eleven times more for first class compared to the regular economy fare!
In general, it's not worth even looking for discounts on business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know very well that there is a small group of passengers willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting to a place quickly and comfortably, and charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The language of the country is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.

The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, a large part understands it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan because this is the language that was established by law as the official language.
Still, Spanish is widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.

The brusque exterior of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show some basic courtesies.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is highly forested, mainly with beech, fir, and pine trees, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.

The pre-modern observatories are mostly outdated today and remain in museums or schools.
As light pollution in their heyday was not a problem, they often meet in cities or university campuses, which are easier to reach than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas that offer favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the favorite flower.
