This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely popular, but also provides details that the fossils as a whole do not provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the feathers of this animal on top have been chestnut-brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides an opportunity to delve into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed handle called rachis, but have other feather characteristics - branches and barbs - researchers conclude that the rachis is likely a later evolutionary development compared to other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used during flight, but rather for regulating temperature or display. According to researchers, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows feathers from an adult specimen, not downy chick feathers.
Researchers suggest that while this may be the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of an adult rather than down of a young individual.

Traditionally in France, voting is low-tech: voters isolate themselves in a booth, indicate their chosen candidate on a pre-printed paper ballot, and place it in an envelope.
After the official officials confirm the identity of the voter, he or she deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French election law quite strictly defines the procedures.
From 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can see that at the beginning of the voting there are no envelopes inside and that no other envelopes are allowed, except those of duly counted and eligible voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Karpanedo is competing in two individual races in the championship, except for the event on Wednesday.
Her first event was the slalom, in which she reached the "unfinished" on her first run. 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
At the other competition, the Giant Slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a combined running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Lösch, who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth place finisher, the Hungarian Gyoungyi Dani.
Four women from the group of sitting skiers did not finish their rounds, and 45 out of 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the competition.
The police in Madhya Pradesh has found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D.K. Aria stated that they have arrested the five individuals who raped the Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop.
Grandma Kanjar, Buta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar are the names of the accused.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the chief of police, stated that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver has sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened is temporarily closed so that emergency services can remove the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoja has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then, accused of killing her son.
She is in custody, waiting for the indictment and trial, but every witness testimony can be discredited because her image has been widely spread.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice operates differently and courts consider the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "it seems journalists are crossing a dangerous line if they disseminate photos, etc. of suspects."
The Royal Prosecutor's Office, which is responsible for criminal prosecution, pointed out to the journalists that no further comments will be made until the indictment is filed.
According to the leaked information, the document will relate to the dispute over the borders that Palestine seeks based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
It is assumed that the other reflected topics are about the future state of Jerusalem, sacred to both sides, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
After signing the agreement, Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years, while Pennsylvania agreed to implement such presence for only five years.
The archers in the supplementary pest control test had to be closely supervised by rangers, as the test was observed and its effectiveness assessed.
Within the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were hired in partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage at the National Parks and Wildlife Service NPWS, the four shooters chosen for the first shoot have received detailed safety instructions and training.
Yesterday, Marteli swore before the nine-member temporary electoral council.
This is the fifth temporary electoral council of Marteli in four years.
Last month, a commission to the President recommended the resignation of the previous Central Election Commission (CEC) as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The response of the authorities to the widespread protests against the regime, which began in October, was the commission.
The violent protests were sometimes triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been expected since 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod devices have been reported. It is reported to be overheating, causing a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it had been aware of 27 incidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious".
The ministry responded, calling the delay of the Apple report "a future genuine regret."
Marianna was shaken by an earthquake at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The emergency service in the Northern Mariana Islands reported that there were no damages in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there are no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has detained tourists as hostages in Hong Kong, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza has shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been saved and there are currently at least six confirmed deaths.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released earlier.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Ligins followed in his father's footsteps and began a medical career.
She trained as a midwife and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature birth in his spare time.
His research shows that if a hormone is applied, it will accelerate the fetal development of the baby's lungs.
Government investigators have found two flight recording devices "black boxes" on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.
Luna was honored and respected by her fellow fighters.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extremism. My first manager. Luna went away on the night of the two moons. Quite unique, like her. She was a strong woman."
"The moon is strange like me... maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... let's hope she is in a better place," commented Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
Out of 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, those who oppose the idea of turning Australia into a republic have increased by 8% since 2008.
The acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the campaign for the federal elections in 2010 that in her opinion Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of the surveyed people who want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In the end, 29% of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and participate in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition is under question due to his complaints.
He couldn't take the necessary medication to manage the pain, as they are banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different software and hardware before the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
The scientists hope to understand how the planets were formed, especially how Earth was formed, after many years ago comets collided with Earth.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriages.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
There are speculations that he will run for president in 2016.
FAA asserts that NextGen is a system that will allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel every year, and reduce carbon emissions.
She uses satellite-based technology, unlike the older ground-radar technology, to allow flight controllers to provide pilots with more accurate information and determine the exact location of aircraft.
Additional transport will not be provided and ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there is no parking available with facilities for leaving your vehicle.
The fear of lack of transportation raised the possibility for the game to be held behind closed doors without the fans of the team.
A study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" reported the emergence of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species have evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process takes much longer, due to hybridization between the endemic Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis) and the non-native cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into any form. It can be twisted into small forms.
It can be pulled like a thin wire, which can be twisted and coiled, and then it can be forged or wound into sheets.
It can be crafted very thinly and adhered to another metal. So thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books, known as "illuminated manuscripts".
This is the pH of a chemical substance. By using red cabbage juice, you can make an indicator.
Depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is, the cabbage juice changes its color.
The amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in a chemical solution indicates the level of pH.
The hydrogen ions are protons from which the electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powdered substances and then shape them into a ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, you will feel it a little strange and something like a film will form.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a complex sewer system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women gathered together in mixed company.
You use a satellite when you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away.
The satellite in space receives the call and almost instantly reflects it back.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of the light and our view.
To place a satellite or telescope in space, a giant rocket with a height of over 100 feet is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The biggest thing we have thanks to the wheel is much easier and faster transportation.
He gave us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats, feeding on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
And finally, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats) feeding on a much wider range of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, special work that each cat occupies, which keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats living in large groups called prides.
The herd consists of one to three adult males with blood ties, along with up to thirty females and calves.
Women are usually closely connected, a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides act very similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behavior, and just as deadly to their prey.
The tiger, like a well-rounded athlete, can climb (although not well), swim, make huge leaps and pull with the strength of five healthy men.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as the lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that are known for roaring.
The roar of the tiger does not fully resemble the roar of the lion, but rather sounds more like the uttering of growling, screaming words.
The ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate prey through their sense of smell, sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
With their night vision, they can see very well in the dark and move very quietly. Hyenas hunt their prey by blending into the surroundings and pouncing on their victim.
When a small group of living creatures (small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it passes through a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island, making it difficult to return), it often ends up in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different functions or adaptations than before in order to be a strong competitor.
The indigenous population has not changed at all, it still requires the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it starts to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
At the end of the day, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will differ so much that they will not be able to be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and take in carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants produce their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, as well as make clothes from them. Most edible foods are plants. Animals would not be able to survive without plants.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing except for other mosasaurs.
His long jaws had been studded with more than 70 sharp, razor-like teeth, along with an additional set in the upper part of his mouth, meaning there was no salvation for anything that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a split tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may have even been a cannibal.
It attacked everything that entered the water, not even a giant dinosaur like T. Rex could measure up to it.
Although most of their food is known to us, the Romans also had quite unusual or uncommon delicacies, including dormice, peacocks, snails, and various rodents called "dormice."
The other difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together, reclining while they eat.
The ancient Roman dishes could not have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn, nor potatoes, nor tomatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tried turkey.
The Babylonians built a first-rate temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People were making sacrifices to the gods, while the priests were trying to satisfy their needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower represented a special sanctuary of the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not of such importance.
The majority of the Jewish family's life happens outdoors.
The women were cooking in the yard; the shops only had shelves facing the street. The houses were made of stone.
In the land of Canaan, there are no extensive forests, so the wood has been extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
But despite its discovery, at that time, Inuit tribes were already living there.
Although each of the countries was "Scandinavian", there were many differences among the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland.
You might think that the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence if you have watched the movie "National Treasure".
This is not true, though. This is not a treasure map, even though there is something written on the back of the document.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text appears at the bottom of the document with the head down.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that initially, after it was created, the large parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be preserved.
Most likely the notation was added only as a label.
With the landings on D-Day and the subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French from Vichy. These are the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked together with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
The allies entered Southern France on August 15, 1940, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
Within just two weeks, American and French forces liberate Southern France and move towards Germany.
Civilisation represents a culture shared by a substantial and large group of people, working and living together, society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis", which means "civil", related to the Latin "civis" or "citizen" and "civitas", which in turn is "city" or "city-state", and this somehow determines the size of the society.
City-states have been predecessors of nations. Culture in the context of civilization implies passing on knowledge through several generations, leaving a lasting cultural imprint, and naturally spreading.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving the corresponding historical evidence of their existence, and therefore they fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states for the first time formed a weak central government, with the Congress as its only component according to the Constitution of the Confederation.
The Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and as there was no national judicial or executive power, it relied on state authorities, which often refused to cooperate and enforce all of its acts.
Also, they do not have the authority to reject tax laws and intergovernmental tariffs.
The clauses required unanimous agreement from all states in order to be changed, and the states treated the central government so unseriously that their representatives often were absent.
Together with the German national football team, the Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world. They were champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
The popular sports include football, volleyball, basketball, cycling, water polo, fencing, rugby, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 races.
The most popular in the northern regions are winter sports, with Italians competing both in international competitions and in the Olympic Games.
Japan possesses almost 7000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, as a geographical concept, it is often called an "archipelago".
Taiwan was first discovered in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as "Ilha Formosa" or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing changes in local customs for grain production and hiring Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal regions of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan to be a province of the Qing empire.
In 1895, after the loss of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures, namely the Temple of the Sun, Intihuatana and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the boundaries of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of how they appeared.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration work continues today.
The most common format for still photography in the world, for example, is 35 mm. This was the dominant size of film at the end of the analog film era.
He is still being produced today, but more importantly, its image format is inherited from the sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The ratio of the sides of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest denominator of whole numbers), therefore, is 3:2.
The same or very similar to this ratio are very common formats (for example a group of APS formats).
The much abused and often mocked rule of thirds is simply a rule that creates dynamics while at the same time maintaining balance in the composition.
The most suitable place for the main subject is indicated to be at the intersection point of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which has already become wealthy and powerful, is subjected to criticism.
The Christian religion has connected European countries for over a thousand years, despite linguistic differences and different customs.
His all-encompassing power reached everyone - from the king to the common man.
The main Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the financial resources of the church exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church has continued in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to wonder if this principle has been upheld.
Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the outbreak of military operations.
Despite violating the established international law, codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries, the strategy proved to be effective, disrupting vital military and civilian supplies.
Great Britain mines international waters to prevent ships from entering certain ocean areas, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic is limited, Germany expects a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, an attitude of pacifism and isolation predominated among most citizens and nations.
The nations wanted to avoid a military situation again in the future, after witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War.
In order to take a job at the Edison company in New York, Tesla moves to the United States in 1884.
He arrives in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a poetry collection, and a recommended letter to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job).
In ancient China, there existed a unique way of displaying different periods of time; for each stage of history or for each ruling family, there was a separate dynasty.
Between every two dynasties there were also unstable times of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods is the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, there has been a fierce war between many noblemen, fighting for the throne.
The three kingdoms were one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of ancient China. Fighting to sit on the highest seat in the grand palace Xian, thousands of people have died.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just to one ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, positions were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, because instead of the division in the army being based on class, now it is based on caliber.
The French Revolution is also an inspiration for many other oppressed people from the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohamed was deeply interested in things beyond this worldly life. To contemplate, he often visited a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain of Nur (light).
The cave itself, survived through time, reveals a very vivid picture of the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is entirely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists. Once you enter the cave, the isolation is complete.
Nothing else is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above us and the many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen.
The Great Pyramid in Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that currently exists.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramidal structures constructed to honor the deceased pharaoh.
In the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, on the Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," there are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid is in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples are in honor of his wives and family members.
The "upward bow" symbol looks like a V, and the "downward bow" symbol looks like an arch or a square without a bottom.
Up means you start from the top and press the bow, and down means you start from the frog (where your hand holds the bow), and then pull it.
The upward-facing bow usually produces a softer sound, while the downward-facing bow is louder and more confident.
Feel free to place your own marks, but remember that the printed bow strokes are there for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), as well as the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, are forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and screaming threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, one of the crowd swung the head of a royal guard, killed at Versailles, in front of the horrified queen.
The Filipinos themselves paid for the military expenses of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines.
The colonial regime of the USA forced them to pay taxes to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
The super profits obtained from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people are, of course, the main gains of American imperialism.
In order to understand the meaning of the Templarism, the context that led to the creation of the order must be clear.
The period during which the events took place is usually referred to as the Late Middle Ages - the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 - 1300 AD).
The true Middle Ages is preceded by the early and followed by the late, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice - from technological push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is governed by the logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Two common ideas are shared among most interpretations of technological determinism: the development of technologies follows a path far surpassing cultural or political influence, or the technology itself influences inherent, rather than socially conditioned societies.
For example, one can say that motor vehicles necessarily lead to the development of roads.
A national road network, however, will not be economically viable only for a handful of cars, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars also led to a higher frequency of road accidents, which necessitated the invention of new techniques in healthcare for the recovery of injured bodies.
Romanticism contains a significant element of cultural determinism, whose beginning is attributed to writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shapes individuals and over time, traditions and culture related to this geography emerge, and they, being in harmony with the society's place, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
By the way, Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame at the epicenter of luxury dates back to around 400 BC and continues until around 1100 BC.
Her status declined in the twelfth century mainly because the crusaders returned with gifts such as spices and silk, which were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
During this time, the title "Fashion Capital" is transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
At the beginning, the clothing was heavily influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication, Western styles may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. As a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to fasten their clothes, which is one of the greatest developments of that time.
Agriculture as a means of subsistence is agriculture that is carried out to produce enough food solely for the needs of the farmer and his family.
The market-oriented agriculture is a simple, often organic system, often using saved seeds from the same ecological region, combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
In historical terms, most farmers have been involved in agriculture for subsistence, and this still holds true for many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel neglected by societal standards. They allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The signs that define a subculture as separate can be of linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic nature, or a combination of factors.
Members of a particular subculture often signal their membership through characteristic and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most commonly used means of illustrating the importance of socialization is the example of several unfortunate cases with children who, due to neglect, mistreatment, or deliberate violence, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been kept in captivity by people (usually their own parents); sometimes the abandonment of such children was due to the rejection of severe intellectual or physical disability of the child by the parents.
The wild children before being abandoned or running away may have been severely mistreated or traumatized.
Others are supposed to have been raised by animals; for some, it is said that they lived alone in the wild.
When fully raised by animals, the wild child demonstrates behavior (within physical limitations) closely resembling that of the specific caring animal, as well as their fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a step further.
The building of scaffolding is not a method of training, but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals undergoing new training, such as a new computer program or starting a new project.
The skeletons can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of scaffold, as well as the little man with the brackets in Microsoft Office.
The software includes built-in virtual skeletons, which aim to ask questions, provide hints, and explain procedures that may have been too difficult for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster families for many different reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but that happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
It is believed that our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, as well as reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide everything that was missing in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and individual communication.
The special features of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of using the satisfaction approach.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are identified as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Emir and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
It is argued more specifically that a person can discover if a certain person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his work "The President's Speech," Oliver Sachs points out that regardless of the fact that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are able to perceive sincere attitude.
He even assumes that similar abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are 2 groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variations forward and backward between the two pools with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its need for amino acids through available plant resources.
The consequences of failure are serious: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins from the leaves and seeds of leguminous plants, but they are difficult for us to digest unless cooked.
Unlike vegetable-based foods, animal products (termites, ants, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
Taking all this into account, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do it today.
The interruption of sleep is the process of intentional waking up during your usual sleep time and falling asleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock that can bring you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find that you are turning off your alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it at the other end of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before bedtime, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person possesses is in inverse proportion to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the stronger the positive life force. Every person has the potential to discover absolute calm and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. Our own tension and negativity are the only thing standing in the way of reaching this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it is enriched with many techniques from Indian yoga and the Mahayana path of love.
Tibetan Buddhism is built on a very simple principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the energy of kundalini (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, visualizations, and mantras.
At the center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, the energetic channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and enlightenment of consciousness is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to collaboration between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, differences in their systems, processes, and cultures led to conflict between these states.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies and the Cold War had begun.
She continued over the next 40 years and waged a real battle through mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Cuba, Afghanistan, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense is already broken and the only hope is to withdraw along the Romanian bridgehead and reconsider its organization.
These plans, however, became invalid almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after taking over the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is the most efficient way to transport a huge number of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional task of naval fleets is to ensure the ability of your country to move your people and goods, while at the same time interfering with the ability of your enemy to move their people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to get people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy is trying to stop this traffic, mainly with the help of submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have conquered Britain, like the rest of Europe.
Goats were likely domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountain range in Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them in order to have easy access to milk, wool, meat and skins.
Home goats are usually raised in herds that roam the hills or other pastures, often accompanied by goatherds, who are usually children or young boys, similar to the more widely known shepherd. These methods of herding are still used.
The railway lines were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the railroad tracks consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to achieve greater speed and pull heavier loads than on the more uneven paths typical of that time.
The crossties were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place. However, it was gradually understood that the rails would have been more effective with an iron band on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Gradually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known way of movement was walking, as people started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of homo erectus (or upright man).
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, usually did not walk upright.
Bipedal specializations have been discovered in the fossils of australopithecines from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living with more care for the environment, join the ecological movement, and even become activists to reduce the negative impact in the future to a certain extent.
In many cases, this is exactly like symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we need to find the roots of the problems and remove them.
It is obvious that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity and the problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of people.
After being accepted by the Congress on July 4 and signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, the handwritten copy was sent to John Dunlap's printing office, located a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The document was read for the first time publicly by John Nix in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8th.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops on July 9 in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 single-sided copies of the Dunlap on large sheets, for which it is still known to exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived.
In modern times, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs has survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Because they have feathers and can fly, many people don't think of them as dinosaurs.
But for the birds that still resemble dinosaurs, there are a lot of things.
They have legs with claws and scales, walk on both their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex, and lay eggs.
Almost all computers used today operate on the basis of manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
The binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning does not always manifest immediately. Such symptoms as vomiting are too general to make a diagnosis immediately.
The presence of an open container with medication or toxic household chemicals may be the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific instructions on administering first aid for this poison.
The term "butterfly" is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term originates from the long-standing acquaintance with termites, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing on humans.
Like the flying ants, the common ants are colorless, they live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the leading neurological disease among young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Studies show that the likelihood of having MS is twice as high in women as in men.
A couple can decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
When adopting, the parental rights of the biological parents are terminated, after which the other couple can be the parents of the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world functions through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
It's not just experimenting, although experiments are used to eliminate some of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and using guides also accompany scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers work more with classical texts, and in particular with the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West has been cut off from its Greek scientific and philosophical roots.
In physiology and behavior, many of the observed rhythms often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are more than reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to perform the cycle of free movement even if there are no external signals.
One of the leading assumptions that DNA is genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hursh and Chase have used phages or viruses to graft their DNA onto bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus, or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are embryonic cells, mutations can have a variety of effects.
Only mutations in cells of the germ line can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is appealing to people with an interest in visiting natural areas in order to admire the landscape, including wild plant and animal species.
The activities that can be carried out here include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as studying information about the ecosystem.
The visit, photographing, and studying of orangutans in Borneo are examples of this.
Every morning, people travel from small provincial towns to their workplace by car, passing others whose destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport system, everyone is to some extent connected to and maintains the transport system through private vehicles.
That this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution over the past two million years, is now shown by science.
Every person is part of the society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, there are rarely so many complaints about water quality or crumbling bridges.
Why do the transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they break down every day? Are the transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more important happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Since the behavior of drivers, unfortunately, cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty, studying the traffic flow is difficult.
Fortunately, drivers tend to stay within a relatively consistent range, so traffic flows have a certain logical sequence and can be approximately represented mathematically.
For better visualization of the flow of traffic, the links between the three main characteristics have been determined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections help in the planning, designing, and finally operating of road facilities.
Insects are the first animals to have flown in the air. Their ability to fly has helped them to escape their enemies more easily and to find food and mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings today.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people believe that he is right, but many are of the opposite opinion - that the Solar system revolves around Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because you don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth. It carries over 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river on Earth, at some points 6 miles wide.
The Amazon River contributes a full 20% of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans.
The main river Amazon is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. Thousands of smaller rivers pour their waters into it.
Despite the construction of stone pyramids continuing until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza remain unrivaled in size and technical superiority of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the country with the smallest population and the smallest independent state in the world.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and for official communication.
While Latin is often used in religious ceremonies, Italian is the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state.
All Vatican subjects are Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as all of them can be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is composed of one or more of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, it was like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Metals are considered elements like calcium and potassium. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe is made of matter, which in turn is made of small particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
When it appeared, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the pencil has been reduced to a lower status and usage.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens and don't have to touch pencil sharpeners.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new emerges.
The nuclear- plutonium bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a core with many protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing a heavy cart up the hill. Then the splitting of the core releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which is why they are prone to decay with little or no push.
The lunar surface consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
She is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more seas from the nearby country, because the crust there is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
The theories of happiness are focused on discovering what makes people respond or attract them.
These theories assume that people have certain needs and/or desires, which have been internalized by reaching adulthood.
These theories examine what causes certain people to desire the things they do and which things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's "Hierarchy of Needs" and Herzberg's "Two-Factor Theory of Motivation" are the two popular content theories.
Generally speaking, after managers start managing their former colleagues, two types of behavior may emerge. On one hand, there are those who try to remain "I'm one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of managers face difficulties in implementing disciplinary measures, making unpopular decisions, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
A person transforms, at the other end of the spectrum, into an unrecognizable individual who feels the need to change everything the team has done and make it their own.
In the end, the leader is responsible for the successes and failures of the team.
Such behavior often leads to a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as the normal ones, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team often serve as a point of contact with their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet across different time zones, which their local management may or may not understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
"The invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. This team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of creating a learning organization? Innovating in practice is one of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts.
When all available resources in the functional departments of an organization are used effectively, creativity and inventiveness can flourish.
As a result, the organization's process of overcoming obstacles can lead to a new innovative process serving the needs of the customer.
Before an organization becomes innovative, its leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as organizational training and knowledge sharing.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher results.
Physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of knowledge is provided by neurobiological data. This narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The link between pathology and brain behavior supports the research of scientists.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and alter some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that were previously unseen.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials for building simulation models, which help us understand the processes in our consciousness.
Although artificial intelligence has great significance in science fiction, it forms a very important branch in computer science, dealing with learning, behavior, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves creating machines that can perform tasks automatically, requiring intelligent behavior.
Some of the examples that can be listed are control, planning and scheduling, ability to respond to diagnoses and customer queries, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and face.
Similar problems have turned into separate disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life issues.
The artificial intelligence system, which is embedded in several home computer and software applications for video games, is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military affairs.
Excursions are a big part of school education. Often, the teacher would like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual tours. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire the beauty of art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a field trip is also a great way to document the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from the "Benet" school in North Carolina create an internet page about their trip to the capital of the state, every year this page is remodeled, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a sketchbook.
Bulgarian sentence: В помощ на подобреното писане на студентите могат да са блоговете. Докато студентите често започват опита си с блоговете с лоша граматика и спелуване, наличието на публика обикновено променя този факт. English sentence: Blogs can be helpful in improving students' writing. While students often start their blogs with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes this fact.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger has started striving to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Also, publishing in blogs "forces students to be more familiar with the world around them". The need to nourish the interest of the audience inspires students to be interesting and smart (Toto, 2004).
Running a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning far beyond the regular school day.
Through the appropriate use of blogs, "students can become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet materials in the context of other people's writings, students can define their positions and also outline their own viewpoints on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is a charming and bilingual capital of Canada, where there are numerous art galleries and museums where you can see Canada's past and present.
To the south is the Niagara Falls, while to the north are the pristine natural beauties of Muskoka and the surrounding lands.
All these things confirm Ontario as a model for typical Canadian according to foreigners.
The large northern areas are quite sparsely populated, with some of them being almost uninhabited deserts.
One surprising population comparison: the number of African Americans in the USA is larger than that of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean close to the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and by itself a separate continent in terms of its wild nature.
Most small islands are independent nations or are connected to France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands and it had a great influence in the Comoros and Mayotte islands.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India, known as the "Cape of Good Hope" route.
To the north, the region borders with the Sahel, and to the west and south with the Atlantic Ocean.
Jeni: It is advisable for every traveling woman to declare that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It is nice to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can lead to situations considered by them as harassment, in which they are often followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be firm when turning down men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name "Casa Branca", but they abandoned it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan restores the city as Dar el-Beyda, and the name Casablanca is given to it by Spanish merchants who create their trading posts there.
From all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping.
It's easy to find places around the old Medina, where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as tagines, ceramics, leather products, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near the eastern border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the volcanic eruption of Mount Nyiragongo, which flooded most of the city streets, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside of Goma should be carefully researched to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest ways to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use "boda-boda" (motorcycle taxi) to move around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
"Timbuktu", combined with its relative inaccessibility, has gained usage as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today Timbuktu is a poor city, despite being turned into a tourist attraction because of its reputation and having an airport.
It was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites in 1990 due to the threat of desert sands.
This was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS show "The Wonders of the African World".
The city sharply differs from the other cities in the country, because it has more of an Arabic look rather than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and stretches east along the border with Mozambique, with Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River as its southern boundary.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km², divided into 14 separate eco-zones, each with its own unique wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Usually all South African national parks require daily entrance and conservation fees.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either selected parks in South Africa, or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists believe is worth visiting.
The array of buildings that form the silhouette of Hong Kong resembles a glittering, columnar diagram that stands out because of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the islands and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of the well-developed part of Hong Kong Island is densely situated on reclaimed lands along the northern coastline.
This is the place that the British colonizers appropriated, and if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this territory, it is good to start here.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching for 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This part of the forest, located on Indian territory, is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just from mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining remnants of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², with almost one third of this area covered by water and mud.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are already 400 royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses depart throughout the day from the inter-district bus station (behind the river), although most of them, especially those moving east and towards Djakar/Boomtang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is recommended to purchase a ticket several days in advance, as intercity buses are often full.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way of traveling short distances, such as to Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock river is a cable-stayed bridge. It stretches over the Oyapock river to connect the cities of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two masts rise to 83 meters, the length is 378 meters, with 2 sails with a width of 3.50 meters each.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge is expected to be put into operation in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant local tribe, whose representatives inhabited present-day Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters, also practicing agriculture for sustenance.
Chaco region is home to other groups of local tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who have survived by hunting, gathering fruits, and fishing.
Paraguay, previously referred to as the "Gigantic Province of India," was founded in the 16th century as a result of the meeting of the Spanish conquerors with the local groups.
The Spanish started the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its distinct character and identity since the founding of Asuncion in 1537.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and individual players in the world in polo.
The biggest annual tournament is held in December at the polo field in Las Canitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be watched here at other times during the year.
Check Asociacion Argentina de Polo for news about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP) with a value equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the bank located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, which is the only one on the islands.
The British pounds are usually accepted everywhere on the islands, and American dollars are also often accepted within the "Stanley" credit cards.
On the remote islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, but British and American currency can be used; speak to the hosts in advance to find out the acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange currency on the Falkland Islands outside of the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures above +30 °C are normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but combined wind and moisture lead to a feeling of colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: throughout the year, the amount of rain remains approximately equal.
Despite the fact that many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals still remain wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how obedient they look, bisons, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they did not observe the necessary distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so do not enter their personal space.
In addition, keep in mind that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000 people.
Apia, which has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959, was founded in the 1850s.
There was a scandalous maritime collision at the port in 1889, as seven ships from Germany, the USA, and the UK refused to leave.
All ships are sunk, with the exception of one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lose their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the "Mau" movement, a peaceful gathering in the city ends with the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
As Oakland crosses two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Beach in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are guarded sandy beaches for bathing and most have shade under the trees huddled together.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are near the "Waitemata" harbor, in the vicinity of the expensive neighborhoods "Mission Bay" and "St Heliers" in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One". It is not a heavy beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. "Manta" is the name of the other local beer.
There are many French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian ones may be more popular.
The local tap water is completely safe for consumption, but bottled water is easily available if you are afraid.
The idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians. Short black is "espresso", cappuccino is topped with whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets the Belgian standard. The fruit juices are expensive but wonderful.
Many of the trips to the reef are year-round, and the accidents at the reef, caused by any of these reasons, are rare.
After all, pay attention to the advice of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay special attention to safety warnings.
The cubic jellyfish can be found near the beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the town of 1770. Sometimes they can be encountered outside of this period.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat is at the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance ensures peace of mind for the traveler that they will have somewhere to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Tourist agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may find other accommodation options, such as campsites, through a tourist agent.
Tourist agencies often offer packages with included breakfast, airport transportation, or even combined packages of plane and hotel.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should be directed first to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants choose to camp on the festival grounds, and most participants consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you will have to go early to get a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages may have finished, there may be festival stages where the music will continue to play late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the North Baltic in the winter, check the location of the hut, as for the most affected, crossing the ice causes quite a terrible noise.
Cruises to St. Petersburg also include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually put a lot of effort into getting guests to spend maximum time and money. Typically, there are no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
In order to keep the guests in a good mood and to keep them in the premises, they usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment deals.
At some places, free alcoholic drinks are offered. However, drunkenness affects judgment, and all good hosts know how important it is to remain sober.
Anyone who will drive at high altitudes or through mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice, or subzero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, traction is weak and you cannot drive as on clean asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time for you to get stuck.
Visibility can also be limited during snowfall or blizzard, as well as due to condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, freezing and snowfall are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic is almost continuous throughout the year.
Safaris may be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and are the ultimate goal for many visitors.
The term "safari" in its popular use refers to a land journey to observe the amazing African wildlife, specifically in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to the cars and it provides a good view with standard equipment.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy and are better observed with binoculars.
The pedestrian safari (also called "walk in the wilderness," "tourist safari," or "hiking") is a walk that lasts for several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some of the events will take place in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympic Games, after hosting the games in 1964.
If you have booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the season's postponement, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
The expectations are that most tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular ones costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels provide an iron and ironing board, even if the room does not have them.
If you don't have an iron or don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if there is one.
Do not allow the fabric to become too hot (which can cause shrinking or in extreme cases - burning).
The water can be purified in various ways, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others, several minutes are needed.

The distance between Point Marion and Fairmont represents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated remote areas.
If you are not used to driving on provincial roads, be prepared: steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp turns prevail.
The declared speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous or following sections, where they are usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), but strict compliance is more important than in other places.
The interesting thing, however, is that the mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other sections of the route, such as the Pennsylvania wild places.
The German sweets are extremely good, and the Bavarian ones are quite rich and diverse, similar to the ones made in their southern neighbor Austria.

The stirrups are hanging from both sides of the saddle as supports for the rider's legs.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but there may be concerns about safety due to the possibility of the rider's legs getting stuck in them.
In case a rider is thrown from a horse and his foot gets stuck in the stirrup, he will be dragged if the horse bolts. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First and foremost, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and smooth, narrow soles.
Afterward, some saddles, especially the English ones, have protective bars allowing the stirrup leather to escape from the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamo Valley - the best destination for climbers in Chile, known as the South American Yosemite, with an abundance of large granite walls and canyons.

Snow descents, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending on snowy terrain with attached skis or snowboard to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with many enthusiasts, more commonly known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations centered around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The skiing dates back as a sport at least from the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first ski club in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring or ski mountaineering.
They resemble each other, but usually do not include alpine-style ski tours or mountaineering, the latter of which involves steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Look at the ski route as similar to a tourist one.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than if you were walking - but you will very rarely reach the speed of skiing without a heavy backpack on maintained tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean multiple visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a single state in this respect.
While you are within the territory of this zone, in general you can cross the borders without passing through the passport control checkpoints again.
In the same way, if you possess a Schengen visa, it is not necessary to apply for separate visas for each of the Schengen member states, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which products are antiques. Some tax agencies define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be considered as antiques, even though they are not as old as the mass-produced ancient goods.
Raising reindeer is an important tradition for the Saami people, and the culture around this tradition is important for many with other trades.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but have survived with fishing, hunting, and the like, with reindeer being mainly draft animals.
Today many Sami people work in modern professions. Tourism is a profitable industry in Sápmi, one of the regions where the Sami people live.

The course usually covers all the topics discussed here, but in much more detail and usually in combination with practice.
The course usually lasts for 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid activities, and sometimes training in handling weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are common, but there are few publications that consider military zones.
Passengers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents for returning.
The readiness of governments to issue passports to individuals with an undetermined gender (X) or to update documents to correspond to the desired name and gender is different.
The readiness of foreign governments to adhere to these documents is also a variable quantity.
The searches at the checkpoint have also become much more thorough in the period after September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals awaiting surgery should not expect to go through scanners without the intact privacy and dignity of their personal lives.
The dead currents are the returning flow of the waves breaking on the shore, often at a reef or something similar.
The reverse flow, due to the underwater topography, is concentrated in several deeper sections and there may form a fast current towards the deep water.
Most deaths are due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which is likely impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming backwards is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim somewhere where you won't be caught again or may want to wait for the rescue, depending on your skills and whether you have been noticed.
The shock of returning happens faster than cultural shock (it has a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be heavier.
Travelers who have found it relatively easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly challenging to readjust to their own culture again.
When you return home after living abroad, where you have adapted to the new culture there, you have lost some of your habits from your home culture.
At first, when you moved abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that newcomers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not expect that returning home passengers also require patience and understanding.

The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The island of Kral George with the village of Vila Las Estrellas is the largest island.
Other include Livingston island and Deception island, where there is a spectacular natural harbor due to the flooded caldera of an still active volcano.
Ellesmere Land is the region to the south of the peninsula, bordering the Bellinghausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, after which they rise again to form a 360 km chain of the Elsuart mountains, intersected by the Minnesota glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range, is the highest mountain in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with its peak Vinson reaching 4,892 meters.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage, your only option may be a satellite phone.
The satellite phone in general does not replace the mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a phone call.
The service is often used by shipping, including recreational vessels, as well as expeditions in need of remote data and voice communications.
More information about connecting to this service can be provided by your local telephone service provider.
The increasingly popular option for those who plan to skip a year is to travel and study.
This is particularly popular among high school graduates, giving them a year off before university without compromising their education.

There is usually a "registration" fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a wonderful destination for boating. "The land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, located in the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes it is not necessary to have a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for yachts, the smaller boats and kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
The number is the same in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (for example in the Netherlands the number is from 1 to 40).
Most renowned Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.

For some people, understanding how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are paid well to deliver things quickly. Often time is very important for business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and for smaller companies, this has been a problem.
If they have sent things by air transport, unloading and passing through customs on some routes can take days.
The only way to speed up the process was to send it as checked baggage. Airline rules do not allow the sending of luggage without a passenger, such as in your case.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to cough up a fat stack of cash for that privilege (or better yet, get your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: in general, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the regular economy fare for business class and eleven times more for first class!
Overall, it doesn't make sense to even look for discounts for business or first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a specific core group of passengers who are willing to pay a significantly higher price for the privilege of traveling somewhere quickly and comfortably, and consequently be charged for it.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the declaration of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Moldovan Republic, which, although having its own government and currency, is not recognized by any UN member state.
