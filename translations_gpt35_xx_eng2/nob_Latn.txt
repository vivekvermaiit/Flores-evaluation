This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already popular, but also shows details that fossils usually do not have the ability to show, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on top with a pale or a carotenoid color on the underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called rachis, but have other functions for feathers - barbs and quill tubes - the researchers assumed that rachis was likely a later evolutionary development like the other relevant functions.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or appearance. The researchers suggested that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathering and not chicken fluff.
The researchers suggested that, even though this was the tail of a dinosaur, the sample showed the feather coat of an adult and not a chick's down.

The work that was undertaken was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the Milky Way.
Just as the moon affects the gravity on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way affects the Sagittarius galaxy with its forces.
The researchers came to the conclusion that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory suggests that the vast majority of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll encountered the tuberculosis (XDR-TB) that was particularly resistant to medication in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very concerning and alarming because of the extremely high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll believes that some of the patients may have been infected by the bacteria at the hospital and at least two of them were healthcare workers.

In France, the right to vote has traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters go into a booth alone, place a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating their candidate's choice in an envelope on paper.
After officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting register.
The French election law has quite strict codification of legal proceedings.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the voting and that no envelopes are added except those that are carefully counted and from approved eligible voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness all parts of the process. Throughout the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers according to specific procedures and under strict control.

Schneider was a witness from his country through a video link from a USAF base.
Carpanedo competed in 2 individual races in the championship in addition to Wednesday's event.
Her first discipline was Slalom, but she did not finish the race. 36 out of 116 competitors did not finish the Slalom race.
In her second race, she drove to tenth place in the women's sitting category with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than Austrian Claudia Loesch in first place and 1:09.02 minutes behind Hungary's Gøngyi Dani in ninth place.
In the women's slalom group, there were four skiers who did not manage to complete the race, and 45 out of the total 117 athletes in the giant slalom did not manage to advance.
The Madhya Pradesh police retrieved the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and found her mobile phone and laptop."
The suspect has been identified as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The suspect appeared in court with covered faces, said police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki.
Even though there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
The driver, on the other hand, sustained serious head injuries.
The emergency services helped the driver out of the red Audi TT, while the street where the accident had occurred was temporarily closed.
He was originally admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh court for killing her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any potential eyewitnesses may have been influenced since her picture has been widely exposed.
This is common in other parts of the UK, but Scottish law operates differently, so courts consider the publication of images potentially harmful to the victim.
Professor Pamela Ferguson at the University of Dundee notes "journalists seem to be on thin ice if they publish photos, etc. of suspects".
Journalists have been informed by the Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, that no further comments will be presented until charges are brought.
The document is, according to the leak, supposed to refer to the territorial disputes, which Palestine wishes to be based on the borders as they were before the 1967 war in the Middle East.
The future situation of Jerusalem, which is holy for both nations and the Jordan Valley, was among the topics discussed.
Israel still demands military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian state agrees to let this force remain for only five years.
Shooters in the supplementary pest control were closely monitored by foresters, resulting in the trial being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In cooperation with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters received comprehensive safety and training instructions for the first shooting operation.
Martelly inaugurated a new election council (CEP) of 9 members yesterday.
It is actually Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
A presidential commission recommended last month the former dismissal of the CEP (Haiti's electoral commission) as part of a package of measures to drive the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime, which began in October.
The sometimes violent demonstrations arose due to the lack of held elections, some overdue since 2011.
Around 60 cases of overheated iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and giving four people minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that they had been aware of 27 accidents related to the facilities.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "very regrettable".
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time (19:19 GMT on Friday).
The crisis management office of the Northern Mariana Islands said that there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there was no indication that a tsunami would come.
A Filipino man who has previously been a police officer has held tourists in Hong Kong captive by hijacking their bus in the capital of the Philippines, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
As time went on, a photographer took the seat of an old woman when she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician, and in 1959 he began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital.
Liggins began researching premature birth in his spare time while working at the hospital.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would speed up the development of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that state investigators retrieved two "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated that "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died on the night of two moons. Quite unique, just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that "Luna was as weird as me... maybe even more... love her and will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place".
Of the 1400 people who voted before the federal election in 2010, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The temporary prime minister Julia Gillard claimed during the campaign for the federal election in 2010 that Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent in the poll share this view, and wish to have Queen Elizabeth II as Australia's final monarch.
At the extremes of the opinion poll, 29% think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim both 100 m and 200 m freestyle and three relays during the Commonwealth Games, but due to the complaints, his form has started to be doubted.
He has not been able to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain, because they are banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, who is a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, it was reported on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the reason for water on Earth, in addition to organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Since comets collided with Earth a long time ago, researchers hope to understand how planets are formed, especially with the Earth in mind.
Cuomo (53) began to be governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month that legalized same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and stupidity".
There is speculation about whether he will run as a presidential candidate in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, will enable shorter routes and annual savings on fuel while reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike the older ground-based technology, enabling air traffic control to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transportation will be added, overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and short-term facilities are unavailable on the ground.
The possibility of having to carry out the game behind closed doors without the support of the team's supporters was raised due to fear of lack of transportation.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species had evolved in just two generations, though many had believed that this process would take much longer due to hybridization between the endemic Darwin's finch, medium ground finch, and the immigrant cactus finch.
Gold can come in all possible forms. It can be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be pulled into a thin wire, which can also be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into a sheet.
It can be made very thin and adhere to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used as decoration in the hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called a chemical pH. You can create an indicator using cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice will change color entirely depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons without electrons (as hydrogen atoms are one proton and one electron).
Stir together the two dry powders and then, with clean, wet hands, press them together into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, and this feels strange and creates a sort of shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had water closets connected to an advanced sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in the homes of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient times, there were also toilets in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together.
Those times you call someone who is several thousand kilometers away, you use satellite.
The satellite in space receives the conversation and then reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A gigantic rocket of over 100 British feet is needed to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in great ways. The best thing the wheel has given us is a means of transportation that is much easier and faster.
It has given us many means of transportation such as the train, the car, and several others.
Under them, there are several medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey such as hares, antelopes, and deer.
Finally, there are several small cats (including loose pets) that eat the much more numerous prey animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret behind the success is the niche concept. Each cat has a specific job that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the feline species and they live together in larger groups called prides.
The alliances consist of 1-3 adult males who are related, along with up to thirty females and pups.
The females are usually closely related to each other, as they make up a large family of sisters and daughters.
A lion pride behaves much in the same way as a wolf or dog pack, animals that have surprisingly much in common with the behavior of lions (but not with other large cats). They are also deadly for their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (not very well), swim, jump over long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These 4 big cats are the only ones that roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full-grown roar of a lion, but more like a sentence with whiny words.
The ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and even birds if they can. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Researchers believe that the ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by smelling, sniffing the ground to find where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move completely unnoticed. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then attacking the prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population where they came from, for example, by moving across a mountain area or a river, or by moving to a new island where they cannot easily move back, they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
The new population will need different functions or adaptations than they needed before to be a strong competitor, since this new environment has different resources and different competitors.
The original population has not changed, they still need the same adaptation as before.
When the new people eventually start to adapt to their new surroundings, they look less and less like the other population.
After a couple of thousand years or after millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We have named this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is a consequence that cannot be avoided and is a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale (so just breathe out well).
The plants conduct their cooking from the sun using photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Animals wouldn't survive without plants.
The mosasaurus was the ultimate predator of its time, not afraid of anything, except for other mosasaurs.
The long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the upper jaw, no one who crossed its path came out alive.
We're not entirely sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. The diet consisted of turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have also been a cannibal.
In addition, it also attacked everything that came down into the water, even a gigantic dinosaur such as T. rex would not be a match for it.
Even though most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
The fact that poor people and women ate their food while sitting in chairs, while the rich men enjoyed having banquets together where they lay on their side while eating their meals, was another difference.
The ancient Roman meals could not have included food items that came to Europe from the USA or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn or tomatoes, nor potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Romans have tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each god and these were seen as the home of God.
People brought offerings to the gods and the priests tried to fulfill the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes they built special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary made for the god.
House was not as essential in the high-temperature climate of the Middle East.
The Hebrew family mainly lived outdoors.
The women did the cooking in the garden; shops were only open counters pointing out towards the street. The houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in the land areas around Canaan, which made the wood extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, it is told that Erik the Red was deported from Iceland for murder, and then they found Greenland while traveling westward and named it Greenland.
But there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time, independent of his discovery.
There were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, even though all the countries were "Scandinavian".
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you can probably imagine that there is a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
It is not true, however. Despite there being something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, it was written: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text can be seen at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence, the large parchment document (which measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
The comment was probably added as a label.
The invasion and subsequent battles on D-Day liberated Northern France, but Southern France was still not liberated.
It was controlled by French "Vichy" individuals. These were French individuals who had negotiated peace with the Germans in 1940 and actually worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
The invasion on August 15, 1940, when the Allies invaded southern France, was called "Operation Dragoon".
Within just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated the southern part of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a fairly large population who live and work together as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to Latin civis, which means inhabitant, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and this defines the size of the society in a way.
City-states are precursors to nations. A civilization culture presupposes passing on knowledge through multiple generations, a linguistic footprint, and lasting equitable communication.
Smaller cultures usually disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not considered proper civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak central government with the Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national leader or legal system, it relied on state authorities, which were usually not willing to cooperate to enforce its actions.
It also had no authority to override the tax laws and tariffs between the states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all the states before they could be amended, and the states took such a lax attitude toward the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian and German national teams are the second best teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula-1 car racing are popular sports.
Winter sports are most popular in northern areas, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (the largest is called Honshu), making it the world's 7th largest island!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical context, as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginning goes back to the 1400s when European sailors passing by gave the island the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to transition to the indigenous people's grain production practices and employed Chinese workers to work in their rice fields and sugar plantations.
Forces from the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's coastal areas in the west and north in 1683, and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) in 1895, the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki which transferred the rights to Taiwan to Japan, which continued to rule the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has 3 important structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of how they were originally built.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976 and the restoration is still ongoing.
For example, 35 mm is still the most common format for still image photography in the world, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
Today, production still exists, but even more importantly, digital camera image sensor formats have inherited the aspect ratio of the camera.
The 35mm format is actually 36mm in width and 24mm in height, which can be a little confusing.
The aspect ratio of this format (division by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as APS family formats) are similar, or approximately similar to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds is often misused and ridiculed, but is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while also providing a sense of order in an image.
It establishes that the most effective placement of the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds horizontally and vertically (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was investigated during this period of European history.
For thousands of years, Christianity had connected European states despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-pervading authority affected everyone, from king to common people.
One of the essential principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, which is why the church's financial resources are there.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being followed.
A short time after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain began a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy demonstrated that the effect of cutting vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law that has been codified through several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain bombed international waters to prevent any ships from entering certain parts of the sea, creating danger for even neutral ships.
Germany was prepared for a corresponding response to its unrestricted submarine warfare as there was limited response to this tactic.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing all the fear and atrocities of war during the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the USA to work for Edison's company in New York City.
He came to the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a poetry book, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the manager from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each phase of China or each family that held power, was a distinctive dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable age of divided provinces. The best-known in these periods were the Three Kingdoms which took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these periods, there was fierce warfare between many kings fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the ancient history of China, with thousands of people dying while fighting to sit on the throne in the great palace at Xiadel.
There are several social and political effects of using the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation is governed by the citizens instead of just one ruler.
Even after the revolution, it was open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful ones to succeed.
The same applied to the defense, because instead of military hierarchies based on class, they now based themselves on caliber.
The French Revolution was a motivation for other oppressed people in the working class in other nations to also start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things that go beyond mortal life. He often used a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light), where he went to think.
The cave itself, preserved through the years, provides a very vivid portrayal of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
On a mountaintop north of Mecca, the cave lies completely isolated from the rest of the planet.
It is actually not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. As soon as you are inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
There is nothing else to see than the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The only of the seven wonders that still stands today is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, includes many pyramids (where the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the wives and family members of Khufu.
The "upstroke" symbol resembles a V and the "downstroke" symbol resembles a nail or a square without a bottom.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and push the bow.
A stroke usually produces a softer sound, while a down stroke is stronger and more determined.
You can use a pencil to make your own marks, but don't forget that the printed bowing marks are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be taken into account.
The terrified royal family, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, along with their two young children (Marie Therese at 11 years old and Louis-Charles at 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were pressured to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women on October 6, 1789.
The king and queen returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd shouting and yelling threats at them.
The ethnic group forced the king and queen to have their carriage windows completely open.
At one point, a member of the gang swung the head of a royal guard, killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The Filipino people had to pay for the cost of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They had to pay taxes by force to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the costs, and the interest on bonds was conducted in the name of the Filipino authorities through the banks of Wall Street.
The super profits extracted from the exploitation of the Filipino people were a fundamental gain of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the circumstances that led to the establishment of the order.
The age where the events took place is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages in the period of European history that is the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The high middle ages came after the early middle ages and was followed by the late middle ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
:The Mughal empire did not interfere in social culture and traditions for most of its existence, but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive governing elites, leading to more systematic, centralized and uniform rules.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general perceptions: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology also has "effects" on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
One can for example say that the development of roads is due to the car.
A nationwide road network is not economically viable if it is only used by a handful of cars, so new methods of production have been developed to reduce costs for car ownership.
Mass car ownership leads to more accidents on the roads, which has resulted in the development of new methods in the healthcare sector to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism had a larger element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
The characteristic of romanticism was that the landscape shaped individuals and that over time, geographical habits and cultures emerged, and that when these harmonized with one's position in society, they were better than randomly imposed laws.
. In the same way as Paris is known as the capital of fashion in our time, Constantinople was seen as the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
It has been known to be an epicenter of luxury from around 400 AD to around 1100 AD.
The status was not the same in the 12th century mainly due to the Crusaders who had returned with gifts such as silk and spices which were more appreciated than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, attire was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
But due to slow communication channels, trends in the west could lag behind by 25 - 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to create its own style. One of the biggest changes that came at that time, and as a result of the crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture for the production of enough food to exactly meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Self-sufficiency agriculture is a simple, often ecological, system that uses stored seeds specific to the area combined with crop rotation or other techniques to maximize relatively simple yields.
Historically, most farmers were focused on subsistence farming, which is still relevant in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel excluded from the social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique due to their members' age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
The qualities that specify a subculture include linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of several factors.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate how important socialization is, is to start with the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accidents or deliberate abuse, were not sufficiently socialized by adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "wildlings". Some wild children have been held captive by humans (typically their own parents), in some cases this was due to the parents' rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical disabilities.
It is possible that children who are wild may have experienced serious child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or managed to escape.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When a wild child is completely raised by animals, it develops behavior (within physical limitations) that is almost identical to that of the nurturing animal, such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
Even though project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it to a new level.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a tool that supports individuals undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and physical. A teacher can also in other words, be a form of scaffolding, but it is also the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support functions are incorporated into the software and are intended to question, encourage, and explain procedures that may have been challenging for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster homes for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even exploitation.
No child should have to grow up in an atmosphere that is not caring and educational, but it happens.
We perceive the foster care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system will ensure safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should be able to provide all the necessities that they did not have in the home they came from.
It is a combination of elements with both mass and interpersonal communication on the internet.
The special characteristics of the internet lead to extra dimensions in terms of usage and satisfaction approaches.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are considered important motivational factors for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord also identified "personal involvement" and "sustained relationships" as new motivational aspects when they investigated audience reactions to websites (1998).
Through the use of video recordings, significant discoveries have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
Particularly, it has been claimed that one can determine if a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks suggests in his paper, The President's Tale, how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to assess sincerity accurately.
He also claims that such abilities to explain human behavior can be shared by animals such as pet dogs.
According to modern research, there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new gene variation and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination alternate back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
It is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to get sufficient amino acids from the available plant resources out on the savannah.
Furthermore, it has major consequences not to do so: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The proteins found in leaves and legumes would have been the most accessible plant resources, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking them first.
Animal products (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide proteins in high quantities that contain all the essential amino acids.
We should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" with a method quite similar to the one that chimpanzees on the savannah use today.
Sleep interruption is the process of conscious awakening during the normal sleeping period while falling asleep again shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved by using a fairly quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you experience turning off the alarm in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives based on biorhythm involve drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before going to bed, which results in having to get up to urinate.
How much inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with how much tension there is in the body and soul.
The less tension, the more positive life force is present. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can become enlightened. The only thing standing in the way of gaining such insight is our own effort and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was expanded to include the Mahayana's focus on love and several methods from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and complete love.
Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) can be awakened with kundalini yoga through yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
Tibetan meditation is about deity yoga. The energy channels are cleansed by visualizing different deities. This will activate the chakras and enlighten consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which caused collaboration between the USSR and the USA. The clashes between system, process, and culture led to the countries falling out towards the end of the war.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had now become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and was really going to be fought out by proxy armies on battlefields in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places from Africa to Asia.
By 17.09.1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the last possibility was to retreat and reorganize along Romania.
These plans were nevertheless quickly outdated, as over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the peace treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish peace treaty and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is undoubtedly the most effective way to move large amounts of people and goods across the ocean.
The job of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while also interfering with the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
The campaign in the North Atlantic during World War II is one of the most important recent examples of this. The Americans attempted to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to provide assistance to Great Britain.
The German navy simultaneously attempted to stop this traffic, mostly using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Great Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Probably goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
It started with ancient cultures and tribes keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed on hills or other areas for grazing, usually tended to by goat herders who were often children or young people, similar to the more well-known shepherd. These herding methods are still used today.
Lanes in England were created as early as the 16th century.
Even though the wagon roads consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull in order to achieve greater speeds and carry more cargo than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
To keep the tracks in place, the crossbar was introduced quite early. However, it was later realized that the tracks were more effective if there was a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Over time, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first full iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first known mode of transportation. People began walking upright 2 million years ago when Homo Erectus (which means upright man) emerged.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, usually did not walk upright.
Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago, and two-way specialization has been discovered in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago.
We can start by adopting a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, joining the environmental movement, and also becoming activists to some extent to alleviate future suffering.
This is often just like symptomatic treatment. But if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
The world has changed a lot due to human scientific and technological advancements, and difficulties have become more complicated due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyles.
A handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary General Charles Thomson and then sent a few blocks away to the printing office of John Dunlap after its introduction by Congress on July 4th.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight and these are now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the garden of Independence Hall on July 8th.
The one arrived to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 remaining Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The first handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today - they are called birds.
Some people do not see those as real dinosaurs because they have feathers and the ability to fly.
But there are many things about birds that still remind one of dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all PCs used today are based on manipulation of information that is coded using binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1. These numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are generally not sufficient for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be finding open medicine containers or toxic household items at the site.
For first aid guidance specifically for the relevant poison, see the label.
Entomologists use the word "insect" in a formal sense for this group of animals.
This term comes from ancient association with midges, insects highly adapted to attacking humans.
Both Assassin bugs and Bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
As far as we know, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) across the entire USA, making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women have twice the chance of getting MS than men.
A couple may come to the conclusion that it is not the best for them, or the child, to raise a child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. Most scientific research is actually guided by this method.
Experimentation is, however, not the only thing, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the potential hypotheses through questioning. Observations also contribute to guiding scientific research in the right direction.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's view on everything related to science, including psychology, was accepted.
When the knowledge of Greek deteriorated, the West became more distant from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms that can be observed in physiology and behavior are usually completely dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented in virtually all living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, not just as reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a period of independent cycles without external influence.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the foremost proposals that claimed that DNA could be a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or in other words viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They made 2 attempts to label either the DNA in the cell with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the cell with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are bacterial or clinical cells.
Only mutations in bacterial cells can be transferred to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plant and animal life.
Examples of activities in the area include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying details about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people drive by car to get to work outside the village, while others drive in the opposite direction because their workplace is in the village the others are driving out of.
In this dynamic mode of transport, everyone is in one way or another connected to, and supporters of, a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows that the large carbon economy has loosened the biosphere from a stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of the society and uses the transportation system. Most people are dissatisfied with the transportation system.
In developed countries, one rarely hears complaints about the quality of water or about bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems bring about such dissatisfaction, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual drivers and vehicle movements between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it is complicated to study traffic flow, since it is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with one hundred percent certainty.
Drivers usually behave with some degree of consistency so that traffic flow remains fairly consistent and can be mathematically calculated with a reasonable degree of certainty.
To show the flow of traffic better, relationships have been established between three important characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in connection with planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals that could fly. Their ability to fly made it easier and more efficient for them to escape enemies, find food, and mates.
Most insects benefit from being able to fold their wings backwards along their body.
Because of this, they have several small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold back their wings are dragonflies and hoverflies.
For thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus believed that the solar system was moving around the sun.
Some believed he was right, but many thought the opposite, that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and the other stars).
This seems reasonable, as it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on earth. Here, more than 8 times as much water flows as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, it is ten kilometers wide in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water flowing out from the rivers on Earth and into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from several thousand smaller rivers.
Even though pyramids continued to be built in stone until the end of the ancient Egyptian kingdom, they never surpassed the size and technical execution of the pyramids in Giza.
Egyptians from the New Kingdom in ancient times marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the language used by the Vatican City in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the language used in daily by the state employees, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
Every inhabitant of the Vatican is Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as they are found in their natural form in nature and because they are relatively easy to extract, even with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had theories that everything involves a mixture of one or more of the earth's four elements. The four elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the 4 states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also believed that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of 2 or more metals. Remember that there is a variety of elements on the periodic table.
The elements calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good helper for many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, now that newer methods of writing have emerged, the pencil has been considered to be of lower status and use.
People are now writing messages on PC screens, and must never come close to a sharpshooter.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb operates on the principle that in order to assemble a core with multiple protons and neutrons, energy is required.
A bit like pushing a heavy wagon up a hill. Split the core anew and release some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they have a tendency to fall apart more or less spontaneously.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the front side and 100 km thick on the long side.
Thinner under the sea, and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there is more magma on the side facing us, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature and approach adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about certain individuals that makes them want the things they want and which things in their environment prompt them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Usually, two behavior patterns emerge when leaders start leading their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the gang"
For this type of leaders, it may be difficult to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary measures, performance assessments, allocate responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable person who feels he or she must change absolutely everything that has been done and make it their own.
In the end, it is the leader who is responsible for whether the team wins or loses.
This behavior often ends in conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They usually have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet in accordance with many different time zones, something that the local management may not always understand.
An "invisible team" that is present (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p 109) is also a unique element in a virtual team.
The "invisible group" is the management group that each member reports to. The invisible group sets the standard for each individual member.
Why would an organization go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal is to put organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively by all functional departments in an organization, creativity and innovation can occur.
The process where an organization works together to overcome a hindrance can thus lead to a new innovative process that can help meet the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must create an innovation culture and share knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a way to assist organizations in improving performance levels.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. It narrows the scope of research and makes it more precise.
. The interaction between brain pathology and behavior is a confirmation for researchers in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
Brain structures and processes we have never seen before are now possible to investigate thanks to the emergence of new technologies.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes that occur in our brain.
Even though artificial intelligence AI gives a strong sense of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence is about creating machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control and planning of the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting analysis, voice and facial recognition.
These have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and defense, built on several home PCs and videogame software.
Excursions are an important part of all classrooms. Teachers usually love to take students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology provides the opportunity for a solution with virtual excursions. Students can observe museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire great art while sitting with their class.
A great method for reflecting on a trip and sharing experiences with future classes can also be to share the excursion virtually.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the capital, the website is restructured every year, but old versions are kept online to be used as a scrapbook.
Bloggers can also contribute to improving student writing. Even though students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
The blogger started to improve his writing to avoid criticism, as students are often the most critical audience.
Also blogging "forces students to become more updated on the world around them". The need to provide what is desired to the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that motivates to work together, and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the typical school day they are used to.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students to think more analytically and critically; through actively responding to internet materials, students can define their positions in relation to others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada with several art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's history and present.
Further south lies the Niagara Falls, and in the north, in Muskoka and beyond, one can find unspoiled nature in all its beauty.
All this and more shows Ontario what outsiders consider to be true Canadian.
Large areas to the north are very sparsely populated and some places are almost entirely uninhabited wilderness.
A comparison of the population that surprises many: There are more African Americans residing in the USA than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest of them, and is a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most small islands are independent nations or associated with France, and known as luxury holiday destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the nations, and it became popular in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north region it is bordered by the Sahel, in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Ladies: It is recommended that female travelers let people know they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they may perceive as harassment and that it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be determined to say no to men, and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it still doesn't make it acceptable!).
The city we know as Casablanca today was founded in the tenth century BC, and was used as a strategic port under the name Anfa by Berber fishermen, Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese tore it down and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to leave it abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan built up the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was called Casablanca due to Spanish merchants who had established their trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping places in all of Morocco.
Places where one can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hoodies and a whole range of gadgets, are easy to find around the old medina, but they are mainly sold to tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is located in the east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava coming from the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, which led to most of the city's streets, especially the city center, being buried.
Even though Goma is quite safe, all visits outside of Goma should be researched in advance to understand the ongoing conflicts in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing up the Nyiragongo volcano alongside some of the most affordable mountain tours to see gorillas in Africa.
To get around in Goma, you can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The regular (local) price is approximately 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
"Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands, combined with relative inaccessibility.
Even though Timbuktu has its own airport and its reputation has made the city a tourist attraction, it is a very poor city.
Due to the threat from desertification, it was added to the 1990 list of World Heritage sites at risk.
It was one of the major stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in strong contrast to the cities in the rest of the country, because it has more of an Arabic than African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and Crocodile River as the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and can be divided into 14 different eco-zones, which support different wildlife.
This is one of the most popular attractions in South Africa and it is considered the most beautiful national park in South Africa (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It can also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card (a ticket), which provides access to either a selection of parks, or all the national parks in South Africa.
The name Hong Kong comes from Hong Kong Island, and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering bar chart that is clearly visible thanks to the water that makes up Victoria Harbor.
If you want the finest view of Hong Kong, you can leave the island and travel to Kowloon's waterfront located opposite.
The majority of the urban development on the Hong Kong island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, and a good place to start if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past.
The largest mangrove forest in the world is Sundarbans, which stretches 80 kilometers (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps - here are some of the last remaining areas of jungle, which once covered the giant plains.
The Sundarbans consists of an area of 3,850 km² with approximately one third of the area covered by water and marsh.
The Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axis deer in the area.
Buses depart from the bus terminal (across the river) throughout the day, despite the fact that most, especially the buses going eastward and to Jakar/Bumthang, travel between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the local buses are often overcrowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Small Japanese coastal buses that are both comfortable and sturdy, serve most districts.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It stretches across the Oyapock River and connects Oyapock and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers tower 83 meters, it is 378 meters high and it has two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is fifteen meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was closed to traffic until March 2017.
The plan is for the bridge to be fully operational from September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The most significant indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay was the Guaraní group, who were semi-nomadic hunters, but agriculture was also their livelihood.
The Chaco area was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as "The Giant Provins of the Indies," became a country as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous people.
The colonization period that lasted for 3 centuries was initiated by the Spaniards.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its unique character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams with some of the best players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December, at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here.
See Asosiacion Argentina de Polo to find news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The Falkland pound (FKP) is the official currency of the Falkland Islands, with a value equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank located in Stanley above the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are likely not accepted on the outlying islands, but British and American currencies may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to find out what is an accepted payment method.
It is difficult to exchange Falkland currency outside of the islands, so make sure to exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the northern part of the planet and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in subtropical regions; in the summer months, temperatures over +30°C are common.
The cold can be deceptive in winter as the temperature rarely goes below freezing, but a combination of wind and moisture makes it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
The "rainy season" and "dry" seasons are not particularly distinct - the amount of rain is consistent throughout the year.
Most of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but still, the animals are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
You should stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves according to park authorities, and 25 meters from any other wild animals!
Bison, moose, deer, bear, and almost all large animals can attack regardless of how peaceful they may appear.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they have not kept a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous meals and keep a clean camp.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
When seven ships from Germany, USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor in 1889, it became the infamous site of the maritime protest.
Apart from one British cruiser, all the ships were sunk and almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful urban gathering led to the killing of the leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to Auckland's 2 harbors, there are several beaches. The most popular ones are in 3 locations.
The North Shore beaches in the North Harbor district are located in the Pacific Ocean. The beaches there stretch all the way from Long Bay in the north to Devonsport in the south.
Almost all beaches are safe for swimming, and most have shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
Sometimes you find crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast. It is safe to swim.
The most important local beer is "Nummer en", which is not a complex but pleasant and refreshing beer. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that should be tested, but wine from New Zealand and Australia may travel better.
The local water from the tap is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
For people from Australia, the idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is "espresso", cappuccino comes with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The cocoa lives up to Belgian standards. The fruit juice is expensive, but fantastic.
All year round, many trips are made to the reef and rarely are there any injuries due to any of these things.
However, take advice from authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and near rivers from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be observed outside of this period.
There are sharks, but it is unusual for them to attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not primarily live in the sea. Their main habitat is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind since they now have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although there may be opportunities to book accommodation in other areas, such as at a campsite, through a travel agency.
The travel agencies usually sell package deals with included breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even package combinations with flight and hotel.
They can also reserve a seat for you if you need time to consider an offer or obtain other documents for your agreement (for example, a visa).
Various changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the large majority of festival guards decide to camp on the site, and most guards consider it to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to where the action is, you have to come early to get a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night even though the music on the main stage is finished.
At some festivals, there are special camping areas for families with young children.
If you plan to cross the North Baltic Sea in the winter, you should check the location of the cabin, as driving through ice generates extremely high levels of noise for those most affected.
Cruise to Saint Petersburg includes time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos tend to make many attempts to maximize how much time and money is spent by the guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offers for the guests, to keep them in a good mood and to make them want to stay at the location.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages. But alcohol impairs judgment, all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Everyone who is going to drive at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or cold.
The friction is low, on icy and snow-covered roads you cannot drive as you would on dry asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall for you to fall in a very short time.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic goes mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest form of tourism attracting tourists to Africa and is the main attraction for many visitors.
The term "safari" in popular discourse refers to trips to countries to see the magnificent African wildlife, specifically on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, like to approach cars and standard equipment, which will allow for good viewpoints.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards can be quite shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk" or "balancing walk") involves walking either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be from 24.08.2021 to 05.09.2021. Some events will be held in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics. The city held the games in 1964.
If you have booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may struggle.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March, the cancellation policies will not be extended to July 2020, when the Olympics were planned.
It is expected that most activity tickets will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets priced around ¥7000.
It can help to iron damp clothes to get them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, even if it is not in the room.
If an iron is unavailable or you want to avoid wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer instead, if available.
Be careful so the fabric doesn't get too hot (which can cause shrinking, or in extreme cases, scorch marks).
There are different ways to purify water and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil the water for one minute, while in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in terms of effectiveness, and if you are in doubt, you can always buy the water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter infectious animal diseases that they are not familiar with from their home areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case lead to allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals capable of harming or killing people with their power, are usually not classified as plagues.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from tax and can only be purchased at certain locations.
Travelers going to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most challenging conditions for driving on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway are the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, which often goes through isolated backwoods terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your head cool: there are many steep inclines, narrow roads, and sharp curves.
Speed limits posted are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) - and it is even more important to respect them than elsewhere.
Oddly enough, the mobile coverage is much better here than in many other places along the route, for example, Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very flavorful. In Bavaria, they are rich and varied, and can be compared to the pastries of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit baking is common, with baked apples year-round, and cherries and plums making their entrance in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain nuts such as almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Many of the popular cakes taste even better with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but filling pastries, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the area.
A curry dish is based on herbs and spices, mixed with either meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid one has in, a curry dish can be either dry or moist.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is regularly used in curry dishes, while it is common to use coconut milk in South India and some other coastal regions on the subcontinent.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian dishes is an umbrella term, covering a wide range of regional cuisines across the nation.
If used without further pointers, however, the term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now much is available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by lightly spiced dishes, with a dominant flavor of peanuts, chili, sugar, (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups hang down on each side of the saddle and provide support for the rider.
They provide more stability for the rider, but can be less safe due to the possibility of a rider getting stuck.
If a rider is thrown from a horse with a foot caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged by the horse if it runs away. To minimize this danger, many precautions can be taken.
Most riders use riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole for first.
Then some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that cause the leather of the stirrup to fall down from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The largest climbing destination in Chile, Cochamó Valley, is known as the South American Yosemite, with many large granite walls and crags.
The summit climbing offers stunning views from the mountain tops. Climbers from all over the world continuously create new routes in the endless seas of rock walls.
The snow sport in downhill slopes, which includes both skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve riding down snow-covered areas with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a popular activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums", who plan entire vacations around skiing in a specific location.
The thought of skiing is very ancient - cave paintings depict skiers dating back as far as 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 1600s. In 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity also has other names such as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is associated with, but usually does not include cross-country skiing or alpine climbing, the latter being performed in steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as something similar to a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover larger distances than if you walk - but it is very rare that you will achieve high speeds without a heavy backpack in the tracks.
Europe is a fairly small continent, but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several nations would mean multiple visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, functions almost like one country in this regard.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control points again.
At the same time, you do not have to apply for a visa to each individual Schengen member country if you have a Schengen visa, and you therefore save time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal explanation for what kind of manufactured items are antiques. Some tax authorities consider items that are over 100 years old to be antiques.
The definition has geographic differences, including that the age limit can be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques even though they are newer than corresponding mass-produced products.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sami people and also important for the trading culture of many with other professions.
Although traditionally not all Sami people have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, they lived off fishing, hunting, and the like, while reindeer were mostly used as draft animals.
In our time, many Sami people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
Even though the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Romanians, it is often considered impolite because of its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate impressions of the Romanian people.
If a travel advisory is issued for the country you are planning to travel to, it may affect your travel insurance or cancellation insurance.
It's possible that you may also want to consult with other authorities than your own, but their advice is intended for their own residents.
An example could be that American citizens in the Middle East encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The guidelines are only brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The presentations that are presented are often superficial, general, and simple compared to the more detailed information elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for all very serious weather phenomena with the potential to cause damage, serious social consequences, or loss of life.
Dangerous weather can occur anywhere in the world, there are different types. Weather types can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy precipitation, and forest fires are forms of and effects of extreme weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, heavy rainfall, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena consist of snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of bad weather affecting their area, as it may impact any travel plans.
Those planning to visit countries considered war zones should receive professional training.
A search on the internet for "hostile environment training" will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues mentioned here much more in detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last for two to five days and involves role-playing, some first aid, and occasionally training with weapons.
It is common with books and magazines that deal with wilderness survival, but there are few publications that deal with war zones.
Travelers planning gender-confirming surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.
The government's willingness to issue passports where gender is not marked (X) or documents updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
Foreign governments' willingness to honor these documents is just as variable.
In the time after September 11, 2001, searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive.
Preoperative trans persons should not expect to be able to go through the scanners with privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves breaking on the beach, a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated to some deeper sections, creating a fast current that allows for the formation of deep water there.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion during attempts to swim back against the current, which can be very problematic.
As soon as you get out of the main current, it's no more difficult than usual to swim back.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be dragged back in or, depending on your skill and whether you've been noticed, you may have to wait to be rescued.
A return shock occurs earlier than a culture shock (the excitement phase is not there in the same way as with emigration), it lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes have a particularly difficult time readjusting to their own culture.
When you return home after having lived in another country, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the old habits from your home culture.
The first time you traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, since they know that the traveler must adapt to a whole new country.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
One of the most exciting things for kids in the area is the pyramid's sound and light show.
The pyramids are visible at night and you have the opportunity to see them in peace and quiet before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and sellers here. The story of the sound and the light is just like a fairy tale book.
The sphinx is placed both as a background and as a narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, have been claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with 16 active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest of them is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Other includes Livingston Island, and Deception where the flooded caldera of a volcano that is still active provides a spectacular natural harbor.
The area south of the peninsula is Ellsworth Land, which is bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on the peninsula here merge into the plateau, then reemerge to form the 360 km long mountain range which is the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Ice Sheet.
The Mount Vinson summit has an elevation of 4892 meters and is located on the highest mountain in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, in the northern part of Sentinel Range.
In remote areas with a lack of mobile coverage, satellite phones may be your only alternative.
A satellite phone usually cannot replace a mobile phone, as one must be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, leisure boats, and also on expeditions that have remote data and communication needs.
You can get more information about connecting to this service from your local phone service provider.
Getting education while traveling is an increasingly popular option for those who are planning to take a gap year.
This is especially popular among the graduates, so they can take a gap year before university, without weakening their education.
In many cases, embarking on a gap year abroad can actually improve your chances of getting into higher education when you return to your home country.
Usually there will be a school fee that needs to be registered in this type of educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boat enthusiasts. "The land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelago.
It is not necessary to have a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland with one boat per 7th or 8th person.
Even though this is the same for both Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, it is otherwise quite unique (as in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
The vast majority of the distinctive Baltic cruises had an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend a couple of whole days in the historic city, and go back to the boat to sleep at night.
If you only go ashore via cruise excursions, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some of the cruises have included Berlin in the brochures. As you can see on the map, Berlin is not near the sea, and the trip there is therefore not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
There is nothing to be ashamed of, it is no different than other things that a lot of people fear or dislike.
Understanding how the plane works and what happens during flying can help some people to overcome a fear based on the unknown or on not being in control.
Shipping companies make a lot of money for delivering things quickly. Often, time is very important when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for an emergency repair.
On some routes, larger companies use their own planes, but for smaller companies, it was problematic.
If they sent things by air freight, it may have taken days on some routes to get through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to fork out a thick stack of money for the privilege (or even better, get your company to do it for you).
This, however, will not be cheap: As a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to have to pay up to four times more than the regular economy price for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point in looking for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain group of people who are willing to pay well to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and are willing to pay accordingly.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova. Romanian is the local language, but Russian is also widely used.
The multi-ethnic republic of Moldova has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but has not been recognized by any of the UN member states.
Economic connections have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the 3rd largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million. Izmir is the second largest port after Istanbul and is a very good center for transportation.
Smyrna was previously just an old city, but is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, the buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers are drawn with traditional red pitched roofs, the square from the 18th century along with old mosques and churches, even though the city has an atmosphere more similar to the European Mediterranean area than traditional Turkey.
You can see the island of Eysturoy from the village of Haldarsvík, which also has an unusual octagonal church.
There are fabulous marble sculptures of doves on some of the graves in the cemetery.
It is worth spending half an hour strolling in the exciting village.
Northward and not too far away lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra. It became known among foreigners after Lord Byron gave it a glowing review.
The Scotturb bus number 403 travels regularly to Sintra and has a stop at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you must also visit the enormous crypt Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place with Marian art that is popular all over the world.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site, in addition to a place that has an almost immeasurable significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive today who survived their time here, and many more who loved those who were killed or worked to death there, both Jews and others.
Please treat the place with the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not tell jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Please do not damage the area by marking or scratching graffiti into the structures.
Barcelona's official language is both Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer Catalan, and most understand the language, but practically everyone can speak Spanish.
Most signs, however, are only indicated in Catalan because it is enforced as the first official language.
Spanish is also used in public transport and other facilities nevertheless.
Regular announcements at the Metro station are only made in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide range of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The rumor about Parisians is that they are egocentric, rude and arrogant.
Although it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get ahead in Paris is still to behave as best as possible, acting like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will considerably make it easier to get around.
The Parisians' quick facade quickly disappears if you show a little basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered by a lot of forest, mainly of beech, fir and spruce trees, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly large variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soil, and varying levels of elevation.
The area also houses a large number of animals and bird species.
There one rarely finds fauna such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owls, lynx, wildcat and capercaillie, along with several common animal species.
When they are visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries offer shawls to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it has bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Along the same line, men are required to wear shorts that go above the knees.
This could also be borrowed from the storage at the entrance, but the clothes may not be washed after each use, so it may be less comfortable to wear these skirts. One size fits all!
Dishes in Mallorca, like in similar areas in the Mediterranean, are based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and use olive oil for everything.
A light and well-liked dinner, at least in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: Slice with olive oil, tomato and any accompaniments such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns that stand with the word 'Sie' for you always start with a capital letter, even if it is in the middle of a sentence.
This is a significant method for distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
It certainly makes reading easier as well, even though writing is a bit difficult, as one then needs to figure out if a verb or adjective is being used in its substantiated form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The capital letters one must be aware of are c and g, since their pronunciation varies based on the following vowel.
In addition, you should be aware that the pronunciation of r and rr is different: caro means dear, while carro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively easy and quite straightforward grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand the sentences better.
If you already know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
People who know a little Spanish quickly find out that Portuguese is close enough that you don't need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually a bit outdated in our time and are often used for museums or educational institutions.
As light pollution was not the type of problem in their heyday as it is today, they are usually located in cities or at educational institutions that are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The cherry blossoms on display have been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century and are also known as hanami.
The concept originated from China where the blooming plum blossoms were the most popular flower.
The first cherry blossom festivals were arranged by the emperor in Japan only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
The plants look best in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally designed garden and pick some "samples", you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is usually a place with high security, it's a very easy place to navigate, and you can find most things there once you arrive.
But if you are placed in the "tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you need to consider both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which does not occur as often).
There are also a couple of buses that go north to the city of Hebron, to the traditional burial site where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives are buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes into Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, which is close by.
The waterways in the inland can be a nice theme to base a trip on.
Visit for example the castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also provide routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions that we have during the holiday season have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
It is a tradition to stay awake through Easter night at an exposed point to watch the sunrise.
It may well have been a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual, but there are of course also Christian theological interpretations of this tradition.
Several traditional churches often hold the Easter service on a Saturday evening in the Easter weekend, with the congregations often starting the celebration of Christ's resurrection at midnight.
All animals that originally came to the islands did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
The mammals did not manage the journey due to the long distance to the continent, and as a result, the giant land tortoise became the first grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Many mammals have been introduced after humans came to the Galapagos, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to discover the Aurora Borealis, as the sky remains dark more or less around the clock.
Since the places are sparsely populated and light pollution is rarely a problem, you will also have the opportunity to see the stars.
The work culture in Japan is more hierarchical and formal than Western individuals are used to.
Dress is the standard work attire, and employees address each other by last name or job title.
Interaction is important in a workplace, with an emphasis on group effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Employees often need to get their superiors' approval on any decisions they make, and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without questioning.
