This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely spread, but also provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brown chestnut on the upper part, with a pale or carotenoid coloring on the lower part.
The discovery also allows obtaining detailed information about the evolution of birds' feathers.
Since the dinosaur's plumage does not have the basic structure, called the rachis, but instead has other characteristics typical of feathers, such as barbs and barbules, researchers have concluded that the rachis is probably the result of evolutionary development following such characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. Researchers hypothesize that, despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen exhibits adult plumage rather than downy feathers.
According to the researchers' hypotheses, although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals an adult specimen's plumage and not that of a chick.

The work carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the surveys carried out in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The sought-after effect by the team was supposed to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force of attraction on Earth that generates tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to deduce that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that normal matter has.
This theory argues that a large part of the dark matter around a galaxy is gathered in a kind of halo, formed by a multitude of small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally a non-technological experience: voters enter an isolated booth and put a pre-printed sheet indicating the chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials have verified their identity, the voter deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.

Since 1988, voting urns must be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that at the beginning of the voting there are no envelopes present, and that no others are inserted other than those of the voters, duly counted and authorized.
Candidates can send their representatives to assist in every phase of the process. In the evening, volunteers carry out the vote count under strict supervision, in accordance with specific procedures.

The bill provides that violent video games sold in the state of California have a label with the word "18" and makes the sale to minors punishable by a fine of $1,000 per violation.
This morning the Director of Public Prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, released a statement stating that both Huhne and Pryce will be charged.
Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in the government by Ed Davey MP. It is expected that Norman Lamb MP will take over the role of Minister for Business vacated by Davey.
The appearance of Huhne and Pryce at Westminster Magistrates' Court is scheduled for February 16th.
The victims were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old driver Zachary Cuddeback.
Edgar Veguilla has sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will have to undergo reconstructive facial surgery.
Schneider has constant pain, is blind in one eye, missing a section of his skull, and his face has been reconstructed in titanium.
Schneider testified via video conference from a USAF base in his country.
In addition to the Wednesday event, Carpanedo participated in two individual races of the Championships.
The first in the slalom, where she recorded a DNF on the first run. 36 other competitors out of 116 in the same race did not finish the race.
In the other race she participated in, the giant slalom, she placed tenth in the women's sitting category, with a combined time of 4:41.30, slower by 2:11.60 minutes than the first-place finisher, Austria's Claudia Loesch, and slower by 1:09.02 minutes than the ninth-place finisher, Hungary's GyÃ¶ngyi Dani.
Four female skiers from the women's group were unable to finish their races, and 45 out of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not classify in the race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh managed to recover the laptop and the cell phone that had been stolen.
The deputy inspector general, DK Arya, announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We have also recovered her cell phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to the police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
Notwithstanding, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while rescue services were freeing the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
From that moment, Adekoya is at the sheriff court in Edinburgh accused of killing his own son.
She is detained pending trial and process, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be tainted, as her image has been widely published.
It is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice has different parameters. Scottish courts have indeed considered the publication of the photos potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee, "journalists who publish photos or other material of suspected subjects are walking on thin ice".
The Crown Office, which has general responsibility for judicial proceedings, has informed journalists that no further comments will be released until formal charges are filed.
According to leaked reports, the subject of the document will be the dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 Middle East War borders.
According to what is said, the other topics addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon such presence only for five years.
The shooters within the experimental program for controlling harmful animals had to be carefully supervised by the rangers, since the experiment was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Within the framework of the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program, the NPWS, in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters chosen for the first shooting operation have received extensive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Temporary Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
It is the fifth provisional electoral council of Martelly in four years.
Last month a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission constituted Martelly's response to the widespread protests, which began in October, challenging the regime.
Occasionally violent protests have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled as far back as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating malfunctioning iPods have been reported, leading to a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that they are aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had informed them of 34 more incidents related to overheating, which the company defined as "not serious".
In its response, the ministry defined Apple's postponement of the report as "absolutely deplorable".
The earthquake shock in the Mariana Islands was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands, there have been no reported damages in the nation.
And furthermore the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has reported that there were no signs of tsunami in effect.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists.
Many of the hostages have been saved, at least six have died.
You are hostages, including children and the elderly, were immediately released along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was fatally struck.
Liggins has followed in his father's footsteps and has pursued a career as a doctor.
After completing training in midwifery, she began working at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying cases of premature labor in his free time.
Her research has shown that administering a hormone would accelerate lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two 'black boxes' with flight recordings.
Even her wrestling teammates wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer declared: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
"Luna was quirky like me... Maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... Hopefully she's in a better place," was the comment from Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
According to the survey conducted on 1,400 people before the 2010 federal elections, the people opposed to Australia's transition to a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the campaign for the 2010 federal election, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of the survey participants, according to whom Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
Opposite of the survey, 29% of those interviewed support that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% are of the opinion that it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but has suffered several disturbances that have raised doubts about her physical condition.
He could not take the necessary medication to overcome the pain because they are prohibited by the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known to date.
The discovery was confirmed by several people using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to Earth, that is, the matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
The scientists hope to understand how planets form and in particular how Earth formed, having collided with comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, has been in office since the beginning of the year as governor; last month he put his signature on a law that makes same-sex marriage legal.
According to him, speculations are nothing more than "political chatter and nonsense".
A presidential candidacy is being considered for 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of the obsolete ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
Extra transports are not being set up and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while there are no available car parks or interchange parks on site.
The fears related to the absence of transportation means have brought up the possibility of having the match played behind closed doors, without the support of the team's fans.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of birds would have been born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers at Princeton University, USA, and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the time required for this process was much greater; this was due to the mating between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any shape. It can be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, suitable for twisting and braiding. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it has been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts" precisely because of its ability to be made so thin.
It is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice, it is possible to build a pH indicator.
The color of cabbage juice changes based on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the analyzed chemical substance is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the letter H in pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped away (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, roll them into a ball.
Between the moisture on your hands and the outer layers, a reaction will be triggered that will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water connected to an advanced sewage system.
In Greece, remains of sewer systems have been discovered in the dwellings of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
The toilets in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, they were sometimes incorporated into public baths, frequented by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, a satellite is used.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and visibility.
To transport a satellite or a telescope into space, a rocket taller than 100 feet is necessary.
The wheel has greatly changed the world. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important one consists in providing us with simpler and faster transportation.
Thanks to his invention, the train, the car, and several other means of transportation appeared.
Below them there are other medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including free-roaming domestic cats) that feed on small prey, significantly more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The concept of niche constitutes the secret of their success, a particular goal that every feline has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called prides.
The packs are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and pups that can reach up to 30.
Usually females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The pack of lions behaves very similarly to the pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is surprisingly analogous to that of lions (but not to that of other large felines), even in terms of deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (although not very well), swim, make very long jumps, and exert a pulling force five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar. These four felines are the only ones that roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but it resembles more of a phrase of shouted and angry words.
The ocelots love to feed on small animals. If possible, they go hunting for monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds and almost all the prey they catch are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find prey thanks to their sense of smell, sniffing the ground where they have been.
Thanks to their night vision, they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, ocelots camouflage themselves with the surrounding environment and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example, by crossing a mountain range or a river, or moving to a new island, making a possible return difficult), it will probably find itself in a different environment from the one it was in before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, therefore, in order to position itself as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than those required previously.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to require the same adjustments as before.
With the passing of time and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it resembles less and less the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be considered belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists of the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide expelled by them (through exhalation).
Plants produce their own food using the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and produce clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is made from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the super predator of its era and for this reason feared nothing, except for other mosasaurs.
From its long maw protruded more than 70 teeth sharp as razors, plus an additional row located on the palate, so for anyone who crossed its path there was no escape.
We do not know for certain, but it is possible that he had a bifurcated tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it is also possible that he was a cannibal.
He would attack anything that entered the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like the T-Rex wouldn't have been able to compete with him.
Although most of their food would appear familiar to us, Roman banquets also included several strange or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the wealthy men loved to feast together lying on one side while consuming their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include various foods, which arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each deity, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to provide for the needs of the divinities through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built and became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the life of the Jewish family took place outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard, while the shops were simple outdoor counters that faced the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas it is told that it was Erik the Red who gave it its name, having encountered Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of his discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Despite all being "Scandinavian" countries, the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is false. Even though something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is well known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was only added as a label.
The landings of D-Day and the subsequent battles had brought the northern France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was governed by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French people who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied themselves with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action was called "Operation Dragoon".
The American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France in just two weeks and were heading towards Germany.
With civilization, it refers to a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, forming a society.
The word civilization derives from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis", which means citizen, and "civitas", which means city or city-state, and in a certain way it also defines the dimensions of society.
The city-states are the first entities to anticipate the idea of a nation. The culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through multiple generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through fair dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and therefore are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War for Independence, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government, and the Congress was its only component, according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of a national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, for the implementation of its acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass fiscal laws and tariffs between states.
To amend the articles required the unanimous consent of all the states. These, in turn, had such little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports there are: soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 car races.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
They are part of Japan almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago", considering the presence of groups of islands that make it up.
Taiwan is born in the 15th century, when soon after European sailors passing through the area record the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan in 1624, beginning a transformation that involved the cereal production systems of the indigenous people and hiring Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan come under the control of the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan is declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, thus ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan; the island remained under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
A large part of the peripheral buildings has been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still image photography, for example, is 35mm, the same as the most used film at the end of the analog photography era.
It is still being produced today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers) are therefore considered to be 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (for example the APS format family) are equal to or very close to this value.
The much exploited and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point to position the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
In this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had acted as a bond among European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and cultural differences.
His omnipresent power has influenced everyone, from the king to the common citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth should serve to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial reserves exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this convergence of power and money has led many to wonder if this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it involved the interruption of any essential military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating the international law usually respected and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent any boat from accessing entire sections of the ocean, putting neutral ships at risk.
As this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its campaign of indiscriminate submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of many citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his supervisor in his previous job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, the different periods of time were indicated in a very singular way: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
Even the intervals between the individual dynasties were characterized by periods of instability and division among the provinces. The most well-known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
In these periods, among many nobles fighting for the throne, fierce wars broke out.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent epochs in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to secure a place of honor in the imposing palace of Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous, among these we can mention the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same goes for military personnel, as army rankings are now based on caliber instead of class.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers from different countries to start their own revolution.
Mohammed had a deep interest in matters beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers a very clear image of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave rests on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In fact it is not at all easy to find, even if its existence was known. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
One can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a large quantity of mountains around. From inside the cave, you can see or hear very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has reached our days without being in a state of ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramid structures erected in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), various smaller tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of the pharaoh Cheops, and many of the pyramids, tombs, and smaller temples were built to honor the wives and family members of the pharaoh.
The indication "up bow" resembles a V and the indication "down bow" resembles a staple or a square without the bottom side.
Upward means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and downward means that you should start from the frog (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards you.
An ascending bow usually generates a softer sound, while with a descending bow it results in a stronger and more decisive sound.
You can choose to add your personalized markings in pencil, but keep in mind that the parking signs that you find printed have a musical value, so in general they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced King Louis XVI, in a state of terror, to leave Versailles and return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and Elisabeth, the king's sister.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the rulers.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At a certain point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover a large part of the expenses and the interest on the bonds fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government through the banking institutions of Wall Street.
Clearly, the enormous profits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people formed the basis of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly known as the Early Middle Ages, the period of European history that covers the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice includes a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the strict sense according to which the fate of man is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
The majority of interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can affirm that the car necessarily entails the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for just a few cars is not economically sustainable, therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs associated with car ownership.
The ownership of a large number of cars also leads to a higher percentage of accidents on the roads, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a significant component of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the framework of romanticism, geography has influenced individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to this geography have emerged, which, being in harmony with the context of society, have proven more effective than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Similarly to Paris, known today as the capital of the contemporary world fashion, Constantinople was the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
His reputation as a hub of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until approximately 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century, its prestige decreased, especially because the Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 11th century, and in the 14th century.
Initially, the clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
But the slowness of communication routes means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, resulting from the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons to fasten clothing.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practiced solely for the purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, usually organic, that uses locally adapted seeds from the ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at maximizing yields.
Historically, many farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries it is still the case.
Subcultures bring together individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel represented by society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished based on age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be of a linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic nature or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their belonging through a unique and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unhappy cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortunes, or intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some of them have been isolated by people (often their own parents): in some cases, the abandonment is motivated by the rejection of a serious intellectual or physical disability by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma prior to abandonment or fleeing.
Other children might have been raised by animals; others still seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is completely raised by non-human animals, it shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that took care of him, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning should make the learning itself simpler and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a bit further.
The scaffolding is not a mode of learning, but rather a support for those who are embarking on a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding", but so is the small paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to inquire, prompt, and explain the procedures that the student may have had difficulty handling on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, and even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that doesn't guarantee them nourishment, care, and education, but it happens to them.
We believe that foster care represents a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
It is supposed that foster care will make up for all the unmet needs in the home from which they were taken.
Internet brings together elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and gratifications theory.
For example, important motivations for the use of the Internet are suggested to be "learning" and "socialization" (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study on public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships."
The use of video recording has allowed significant discoveries to be made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is believed that it is possible to discover if a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even argues that such abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With mutation, a new genetic variability is added, with selection it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet its amino acid needs with the plant resources available in the savanna.
Furthermore, the failure to carry out these activities has serious consequences: slowing of growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins present in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they are difficult to digest, unless they are cooked.
Animal foods (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a high amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way similar to how the savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a return to sleep (10-60 minutes later).
This process can easily be put into practice by using a relatively silent alarm clock to bring you to a state of consciousness, without fully waking you up.
If I were to decide to reset the alarm clock in my sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, so you will be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options centered on the biorhythm involve consuming a lot of fluids before sleeping (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get up to urinate.
A person enjoys inner peace proportional to the tension existing in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Each of us has the potential ability to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. This goal is only hindered by our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana ritual and various Indian yoga techniques.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Deity Yoga is the core of Tibetan meditation. Through the portrayal of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, system, procedural, and cultural conflicts have caused a rift between the two countries.
Two years passed from the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies; thus began the Cold War.
It would have lasted for the next 40 years and would have been truly fought by mercenary armies on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken through; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, immediately proved to be obsolete, as more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral treaties.
Utilizing ships for the transportation of goods is definitely the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navy has always been to ensure the country's ability to move people and goods, while at the same time countering the enemy's ability to move their own people and goods.
One of the recent examples supporting this theory and most noteworthy is represented by the battle of the Atlantic during the Second World War. During the battle, the Americans sought to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was attempting to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, probably Germany would have had the chance to conquer Great Britain, just as it had done in the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
They began to be raised by ancient cultures and tribes in order to easily have access to milk, fleece, meat, and skin.
The domestic goats were usually raised in herds left free to roam the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds (similar to shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These pastoral methods are still used to this day.
Already in the 16th century in England, wagonways were built.
Despite being simply made of parallel wooden planks, the wagonways, when compared to the slightly rougher roads of the period, allowed the horses that traveled on them to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
The sleepers were introduced relatively early to keep the rails in position. Gradually, however, it was understood that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, even though iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first completely iron rails made their appearance.
The first means of transportation that humans ever knew were their legs. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
His predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Signs of specialized bipedalism are present in the fossils of Australopithecus dating back to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate to some extent future suffering, we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, join the environmentalist movement, and also engage in activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If instead we do not want just a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problems and deactivate it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, while the problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After the Congress adopted it on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by President of the Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were produced, now known as the "Dunlap Broadside".
The document was publicly read for the first time on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall and the task was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on the 6th of July, who had it read to his troops stationed in New York on the 9th of July, while a copy reached London on the 10th of August.
The 25 shots by Dunlap, still known today, are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists today, a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are what we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and ability to fly.
However, birds have many characteristics that they share with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they are equipped with scaly feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is at the foundation of all computers currently in use.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and in the technical computer language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, making an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the house of an open container of drugs or harmful chemicals.
Check if the label has first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term "acaro" is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from ancient familiarity with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become human parasites.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, meaning that they are adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) has about 400,000 known cases, ranking as the top neurological disease affecting young and middle-aged adults.
SM is a pathology that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research has shown that the likelihood of developing MS among females is twice that of males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their own child.
These couples have the opportunity to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the natural parents renounce their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method effectively guides the majority of scientific inquiry.
But it is not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also helps to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's opinions on various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West has been isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior are decisively influenced by the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not only reactions to external periodic signals, in relation to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, i.e. viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells belong to the germline.
The mutations that can be passed on to children are only those at the level of germ cells; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and wild fauna.
Among the examples of activities to do on site are hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example by visiting, photographing and getting to know the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small countryside towns to drive to work, crossing paths with other people whose workplace is the place from which they have just left.
In this dynamic back and forth, everyone is in some way connected to a transportation system based on private cars, which at the same time support.
Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has pushed the biosphere outside of one of its stable conditions that have allowed human evolution over the last two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transportation systems, of which almost everyone complains.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints regarding water quality or crumbling bridges.
Why do transportation systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Is it the engineers designing them who are incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
The "Traffic Flow" (or "flusso del traffico") is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is complex because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers' behavior tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so traffic flows in turn tend to show reasonable consistency and can be generally represented mathematically.
The three main variables (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed have been correlated to obtain a more accurate representation of traffic flow.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing, and managing the road structures.
The insects were the first animals to take flight. The ability to fly has enabled them to escape from enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Many insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings along their bodies.
This allows them to take advantage of a greater variety of small crevices to hide from predators.
Among all the insects existing today, the only ones that are unable to fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
For some, it was true, but many others believed the opposite, namely that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), moved around the Earth.
That seems sensible, because we don't have the sensation that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest river and the second longest on Earth. It carries a water volume equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that in some points reaches six miles.
20% of the total water from the planet's rivers flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River is the main river and is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It is fed by the waters of thousands of smaller tributaries.
Piramidi were continued to be built in stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of their size and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained spellbound admiring the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were already over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City is composed of about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the lowest population.
The language of the Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian: Italian is also the daily language spoken by the majority of people who work within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In the Vatican City, all citizens are Roman Catholics.
The man began to learn about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper already in ancient times: these elements can be found in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them quite simply with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These actually resemble the four states of matter, namely (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma. However, he also theorized that they would transform into new substances, forming what we see.
The alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There can also be alloys composed of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil has therefore proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new methods of writing, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and its use has become increasingly rare.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never need to get close to a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what fate the keyboard will have when something newer arrives.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of how a fission bomb works.
In practice it's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. So, by further dividing the core, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart in the presence of weak or no force.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the farthest side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under mountainous areas.
Mary could be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner. This has facilitated the ascent of the lava to the surface.
The theories on content are focused on the search for what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what unifies certain people and drives them to want to do what they do, and what are the contextual factors in which they live that drive them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most widespread content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor theory.
In general, when managers start to supervise their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
The manager of this kind finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibilities.
On the other extreme, the manager transforms into a completely different person, feeling the need to change the entire team's work and make it their own.
In the end, the leader is the person who ultimately is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence for virtual teams is equivalent to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
The members of the virtual team often serve as a point of contact for their next physical group.
They often have greater autonomy compared to members of conventional teams, as meetings can take place depending on different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The management team to which each member refers is known as the "invisible team" and it sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization have the willingness to undergo the long process that leads to building a learning organization? A good reason to implement the concepts of organizational learning can be innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the collaboration within an organization to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
For an organization to be defined as innovative, it is necessary for leaders to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates the theory of continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area becomes more restricted and therefore much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is at the basis of scientists' research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors can influence behavior and modify certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before observed.
This gives us a large amount of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong science fiction connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research on AI includes the development of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, speech, and facial.
These things have become distinct disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering, and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
The field trips represent a fundamental part of education. Teachers often want to take their students to places that are not reachable by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual field trips. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great opportunity to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing of students. Often, in fact, their first experiences with blogs are characterized by poor grammar and spelling, but generally the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgement the blog author strives to improve their writing.
I blog also "force students to become more aware of the moment that surrounds them." The need to feed the public's interest motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the picturesque and bilingual capital of Canada, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the past and present of the country.
Further south you will find the Niagara Falls, and to the north you can admire the natural and unspoiled beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All of this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to the opinions of foreigners.
The vast areas further north are sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited wild landscapes.
If a comparison is made of the population, the result can be surprising for many: in the United States the number of African American citizens is higher compared to that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and its natural heritage makes it a continent by itself.
Almost all the smaller islands, known as luxurious beach resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
In the lands the Arabs also brought Islam, which undertook a long journey towards Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the route around the Cape from Europe to India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For female travelers: it is recommended that all declare to be married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
It is important for women to realize that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to refuse men, and do not be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a strategically important port used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city formerly known as Daru l-Badya, which was later named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who chose these places for their commercial bases.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the surroundings of the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and lots of knick-knacks, but all of this is reserved for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying a large part of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to thoroughly research before making any visits outside of Goma in order to properly assess the state of the ongoing conflicts in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the less expensive opportunities to see Africa's mountain gorillas.
It is possible to use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Also due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for an exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a decaying city, but due to its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
In the PBS special "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates, it was one of the main stops.
With its more Arabic-influenced than African touch, the city stands out distinctly from the others in the country.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches east along the border with Mozambique, to the north it borders Zimbabwe, and its southern boundary is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 kmÂ², the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which supports different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the most important of the South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, daily contributions are required for conservation and park entry.
The purchase of a Wild Card could also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong, which gives its name to the entire territory, represents the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been likened to a glittering bar chart, made even more apparent because it is framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the waterfront of Kowloon across.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island has focused on the reclaimed land of the densely populated northern coast.
This is the place that the English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this land, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world. It stretches for 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The portion of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 kmÂ², of which about one third is made up of marshy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; the area is estimated to be home to 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer.
The buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those headed east and to Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the service buses between different districts are often full, it would be a good idea to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, in Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
His two towers have a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and have two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
Under the bridge, the vertical clearance space is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic only occurred in March 2017.
In September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The GuaranÃ­ were the most important indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the PayaguÃ¡, who lived off of hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the foundation of AsunciÃ³n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its native identity and peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place at the polo fields of Las CaÃ±itas.
Here one can attend minor tournaments and games also at other times of the year.
To receive information about tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, it is necessary to contact the Argentine Polo Association.
The Falklands have their official currency, the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, offers currency exchange services.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. In Stanley, you can often pay with credit cards and US dollars.
On peripheral islands, they may not accept credit cards, although British and US currencies may be accepted. Check in advance with the owners to decide on an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside of the islands, so change your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures above 30Â°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity creates the sensation of a lower temperature than indicated by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains fairly constant throughout the year.
Even though many of the park animals are used to the sight of humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals.
It doesn't matter how docile they may seem: bison, elk, deer, bears, practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not keeping a proper distance. It is necessary to leave these animals with adequate space, as they are large, wild, and potentially dangerous animals.
Please also keep in mind that odors can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking foods with very strong odors, and try to keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoa Islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population is just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port, the notorious naval deadlock of 1889 occurred, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the paramount chief.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two harbors. The most popular ones are divided into three areas.
The beaches overlooking the Pacific Ocean of the North Shore (in the district of North Harbour) stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
It mainly consists of sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches, sometimes a bit crowded, surrounded by a wide selection of shops. It is safe to swim.
The most well-known local beer is a simple, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have many French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines might handle the journey better.
The tap water in the area is completely safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to the Australians, the 'flat white' coffee originates from a foreign idea. The 'espresso' is a short black coffee, the cappuccino is covered in cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is on the same level as the Belgian one. The fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year, many excursions are made on the coral reef and injuries due to these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Always ask for advice from the authorities, follow the instructions, and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish appear from October to April near the beaches and river estuaries north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside of this period, they can only be found occasionally.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear it and tend to keep their distance.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles mainly consists of the river estuaries north of Rockhampton, as they do not actively live in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the peace of mind of finding a place to stay once they have arrived at their destination.
Travel agencies often will make agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight+hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain further necessary documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests must be made through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
On the occasion of some music festivals, most of the participants choose to camp on site, considering this aspect a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action, it is necessary to arrive early and secure a space near the music.
Remember that once the music on the main stages is finished, there may be festival sections where the music continues into the late night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of your cabin, as crossing the ice causes quite annoying noises for those who are more exposed to it.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time for exploring the city. Cruise passengers are granted exemption from the visa requirement (verify conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything possible to increase the amount of time and money spent by their guests. Usually, there are neither windows nor clocks, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests' spirits high and ensure they stay longer.
In some establishments, alcoholic beverages are offered by the house. However, the state of drunkenness alters the capacity for judgment and every good gambler knows how important it is to remain sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes should take into consideration the possibility of snow, ice, or near-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as when on a clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that it can leave you stranded.
Even precipitation and snow gusts, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle's windows, can reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the major tourist attraction of Africa and the highlight of the vacation for many visitors.
In its popular usage, the term safari refers to land-based trips, particularly in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars more closely, so a normal equipment is sufficient to obtain a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes timid and for this reason it is possible to observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "on foot safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2012, and part of the events will be held in other locations scattered throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games. The first Olympics had indeed taken place in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary, however most of the coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not extend beyond July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the cost of most event tickets will be between 2,500 Â¥ and 130,000 Â¥, while regular tickets will cost around 7,000 Â¥.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry more easily. Many hotels offer the use of an iron and ironing board, even if they are not present in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one available.
Pay attention to not subjecting the fabrics to too high temperatures, to avoid shrinking or, in the worst case, burning.
There are various ways to sanitize water and some of these prove to be more effective against specific risks.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil the water for one minute, while in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of filters is variable, so in case of doubts it is advisable to consider purchasing packaged water in sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travelers can come into contact with animal parasites that are not common in their home regions.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritations, or, in the worst case scenario, trigger allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force are not usually classified as harmful animals.
Duty Free purchases are an opportunity to buy products exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one with the most challenging driving conditions, as it often passes through isolated areas surrounded by vegetation.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes wide open, as steep slopes, narrow roads, and tight curves prevail.
The displayed speed limits are significantly lower compared to those applied in the previous and subsequent sections (usually 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the mobile phone coverage is much higher compared to that present in other parts of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German desserts are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite flavorful and varied, similar to those of the neighboring Austria further south.
Fruit desserts are a timeless classic, from those with apples available year-round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The most popular cakes often pair very well with a strong cup of coffee.
Those who want to taste small but rich in flavor pastries can opt for those which, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid contained.
In northern India and in Pakistan for curries in the inland regions, yogurt is normally used; in southern India and in some other coastal region of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found in the country.
However, when used without further specifications, the term generally refers to the foods originating from the central and eastern area of the main island, Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of easily prepared dishes; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The staffs are supports for the rider's feet and are hung on the two sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider but can pose safety issues as the rider's feet might get stuck in them.
If a jockey is thrown off a horse but has a foot stuck in the stirrup, he could be dragged by the escaping horse. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures that can be adopted.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth and rather thin sole.
Some saddles, especially English ones, have added safety bars, which cause a leather stirrup to detach from the saddle when the rider pulls it back in the event of a fall.
CochamÃ³ Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where you can find a large number of huge granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks of the summits include breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world continuously blaze new paths on its potentially infinite walls.
Snow sports like downhill skiing and snowboarding are very popular and involve sliding on the snow using skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes even referred to as "ski bums," who dedicate entire vacation periods to skiing in a particular resort.
The principle behind skiing is very ancient: the first cave paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861, the first recreational skiing club was opened in Australia by the Norwegians.
Hiking on skis: the activity is also called off-piste, ski mountaineering or ski trekking.
It is connected, even if usually not included, to ski touring or skimo, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a route similar to a hiking trail.
If the conditions are good, you will be able to cover distances somewhat greater than those traveled on foot, but you will rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but formed by many independent countries. Normally, to travel through multiple countries you would need to apply for a visa and go through passport control multiple times.
However, regarding this aspect, the Schengen area operates more like a single country.
If you stay within this area, it is usually possible to go from one border to another without having to go through passport controls again.
In the same way, if you have a Schengen visa, it is not necessary to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus saving time, money, and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an object an antique. Some tax agencies consider an object to be antique if it is at least 100 years old.
The definition presents geographical differences with respect to the age limit, which may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
The craft objects could be defined as antique pieces, even if more recent than similar mass-produced items.
The breeding of reindeer is an important source of livelihood for the SÃ¡mi and the culture on which this trade is based also forms the basis for many other professions.
Even over time, not all SÃ¡mi people have always been involved in large-scale reindeer herding; some lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as work animals.
Today many SÃ¡mi people hold modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in SÃ¡pmi, the SÃ¡mi territory.
Even if widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the word "zingaro" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misconceived perception of Romani people.
If a travel advisory were to be issued for the destination you will be visiting, there may be consequences for your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance.
You might also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that these opinions are targeted at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The notices simply constitute a brief summary of the political situation of a country.
The reported opinions are often superficial, generic, and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general term used to indicate any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruptions, or loss of human lives.
In every part of the world, extreme weather conditions can occur, and there are different types depending on the geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong gusts of wind, hail, excessive precipitation, and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Among the intense regional and seasonal weather phenomena there are thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to check the adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as they may affect travel planning.
Anyone planning to visit a potentially war-torn country should undergo professional training.
Searching on the Internet for 'Course on hostile environments' is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually drawing on practical experience.
A typical course lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many training activities on first aid and sometimes on weapons.
The books and magazines that deal with wilderness survival are widespread, while there are few publications that focus on war zones.
Travelers planning to have gender change surgery abroad should make sure to have valid documents for their return trip.
The intention of governments to issue gender-neutral passports (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
The availability of foreign governments to accept such documents is equally variable.
Inspections of security checks have also become much more thorough in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender people in the pre-operative phase should not expect to pass through checkpoints without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Rip currents are formed by the backflow of waves that break on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Given the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current towards the open sea can form.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion in trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back will not be more difficult than usual.
Try to identify an area where you won't risk being trapped again, or consider waiting for rescue, based on your abilities and whether you have been spotted.
The re-entry shock manifests in a shorter time compared to the cultural shock (since there is a shorter "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes have difficulty readapting to the culture of their home country.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and will have lost some of the customs of your original culture.
In the first experience abroad, it is likely to have encountered patient and understanding people, aware that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine that patience and awareness were necessary even for those returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is the most interesting thing in the area for children.
Before the start of the show, it will be possible to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally you always hear the noise made by tourists and vendors. The show of sounds and lights is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx becomes the background and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the Southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the highest number of bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of a still active volcano filled with water gives rise to a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region located south of the peninsula and facing the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, and then re-emerge to form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km long chain cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, lacking cellular coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a cell phone, because in order to make a call, one must be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
The service is often used by pleasure boats, including those for recreational use, as well as by missions that require remote data and voice.
Your local phone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options for those planning to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly popular among high school graduates, as they can take a year before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a sabbatical year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education upon returning to one's home country.
Usually, enrollment in these educational programs requires payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love sailing. In the "Land of a thousand lakes" there are also thousands of islands, within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are certainly vast enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime of Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This also happens in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but in general it is quite a unique fact (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Many of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic town for two full days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
For landing, a separate visa will not be required (starting from 2009) by using shore excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and the city visit is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can scare people of all ages and conditions, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not unlike the personal fears and aversions that many people show towards other things.
For some people, understanding a little bit about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can be useful in overcoming a fear based on the unknown or lack of control.
The couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often timing is very important in the case of company documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
For some routes, larger companies use their own planes, but there were problems for other routes and in the case of smaller companies.
On some routes, air shipments would have required days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to make it arrive faster would be to send it as checked baggage. And this is where you come into play, since airline regulations do not allow for luggage to be shipped without a passenger.
To fly in first class or business class the most obvious way is to fork out a pretty penny for the privilege (or even better, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to pay is high: roughly, one can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for Business trips and up to eleven times the fare for first class trips!
In general, on direct flights from A to B, it's not even worth looking for discounts on first class or business class seats.
Airlines know that there is a category of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and as a result, they apply certain fees.
The capital of Moldova is ChiÅŸinÄƒu and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been the scene of ethnic conflict in the past.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodox.
Smyrna is the third largest city in Turkey by size, with a population of around 3.7 million inhabitants; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna develops around a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains, and currently constitutes a modern, evolved, and active commercial center.
Although the city has an atmosphere more similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey, wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are punctuated by characteristic red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik, you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and visit a unique octagonal church.
In the churchyard, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
A half an hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north lies the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, easily reachable. It has become famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant account of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Always to the north, visit the large sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of famous Marian apparitions around the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is essentially a mass grave, and has an almost incalculable significance for an important part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who have survived these places, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or worked to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid defacing these places by smearing the structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority is able to understand it; Spanish is practically known by everyone.
However, most of the signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transportation and other services.
In the subway, regular announcements are only in Catalan. Any unplanned service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
The Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and presumptuous.
Although it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to feel comfortable in Paris continues to be to behave as best as possible, relating to others as a "bien Ã©levÃ©" (well-mannered) person. This will definitely facilitate your movements.
The rough outer appearance of the Parisians will quickly vanish if you display some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, predominantly of beech, fir, and spruce, and is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a variety of microclimates, soils, and different altitude levels, it has a great variety of plant communities.
The area also hosts a very wide variety of animal species and birds.
In these places, rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the capercaillie live alongside several other more common animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and to cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide stoles for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if it's brightly colored, you will earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants below the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however, the garments are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts you may not feel comfortable. For men, one size fits all!
The cuisine of Mallorca, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
The Pa amb Oli is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all available condiments, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the pronoun "Sie" used for the formal form which means "you", always start with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This represents an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a nominal form makes the writing quite complex.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced just as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, since their pronunciation changes based on the following vowel.
Make sure to also pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: caro means beloved, while carro means carriage.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and understanding sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with basic knowledge of the Spanish language may quickly conclude that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore does not need to be studied separately.
Nowadays, premodern observatories are usually obsolete and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
The majority of modern telescopes used for research are huge structures in remote areas where the atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The admiration of cherry blossom, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the blooming of plum trees was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants thrive best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take "just" one specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even collecting some plant specimens will cost you being expelled from this place, no discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe city and easy to get around; you can buy practically anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics", just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north, towards Hebron, the traditional site where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their respective wives were buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reaches the inside of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland waterways can be a great theme around which to organize a vacation.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube, or you can sail on the Erie Canal.
Furthermore, they define the routes of well-known hiking trails and bike paths.
Christmas represents one of the most important holidays in Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
The majority of the traditions related to this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
One tradition involves spending the night of Easter staying awake in an outdoor place to be able to admire the sunrise.
There are naturally Christian theological explanations behind this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In the more traditional churches, an Easter vigil is often celebrated on the Saturday night of Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning the ceremony at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally reached the islands arrived there by swimming, flying, or floating.
Since the distance from the continent was considerable, mammals were unable to make the journey. This made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
In the Galapagos, numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs, and cats were introduced after the arrival of humans.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during the winter, it will be possible to experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the possibility to witness the Northern Lights, because the sky remains dark almost all day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution often is not a problem and you can even enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal compared to what Westerners tend to be accustomed to.
The office attire usually consists of a suit and tie or a pantsuit, and colleagues are addressed by their last name or professional title.
The harmony of the workplace is crucial, as it gives importance to the commitment of the group rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to receive the approval of their superiors regarding every decision, and they are expected to follow instructions without asking questions.
