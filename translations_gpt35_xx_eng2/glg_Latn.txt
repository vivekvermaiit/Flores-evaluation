Although the indications point to an experimental vaccine being able to reduce mortality caused by Ebola, so far, no medicine has clearly demonstrated its ability to treat that infection.
A cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, initially showed promising results in that field, but other formal studies pointed to it presenting fewer benefits than expected in preventing mortality.
In the trial against PALM, ZMapp acted as a control, that is, scientists used it as a baseline and compared it with three other medications.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the US Olympic Committee and accepts the urgent need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and of their sport, could be better served by considering a significant change within our organization for the future, rather than withdrawing certification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could clarify how abuses of the dimensions described with so much courage by Larry Nassar's survivors could have gone unnoticed for so long and welcomes all necessary and appropriate changes.

This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (an already widespread theory) and also provides other data that, generally, fossils do not offer us, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists claim that the animal's feathers were chestnut-colored on the upper part and pale or carotenoid-colored on the lower part.
The finding also provides a perspective on how feathers evolved in birds.
As the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called rachis, but do have other characteristics of feathers (barbs and barbules), researchers deduced that the rachis probably represents a later evolution of those other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but for regulating temperature or as decoration. Researchers suggested that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample presents adult plumage and is not the down of a young hatchling.
The researchers suggested that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and it is not the feathers of a young chick.

The work carried out was fundamentally theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations made in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by the forces of the tides between the dark matter of the galaxy and the Milky Way's.
Just as the Moon exerts attraction on Earth, causing the tides, the Milky Way exerts its attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory asserts that the majority of dark matter around the galaxy is located around it in a kind of halo and is composed of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he stated that the new variant was "extremely worrying and cause for alarm, due to its very high percentage of mortality".
It is possible that some patients contracted the illness in the hospital, in Dr. Moll's opinion, and at least two of them were healthcare workers there.

In France, voting has traditionally been an experience with little technological presence: voters go into a booth and insert a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the chosen candidate into an envelope.
Once officials verify the voter's identity, they place the envelope in the ballot box and sign the voter registry.

Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that no ballot was inserted at the beginning of the vote, as well as that no envelopes are added, except for those of the properly accounted and authorized voters.
The candidates can send representatives to witness each and every part of the process. At night, volunteers carry out the vote recount under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider required reconstructive surgery on his face.
The weapon of Uka failed when he was aiming at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers constant pain, he went blind in one eye, lost part of his skull and had to have his face reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider offered his testimony through a video link from a USAF base in his home country.
Besides the Wednesday competition, Carpanedo participated in two other individual races in the championship.
His first event was slalom, where he received a "Did Not Finish" in his first race. 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result in that competition.
In the other competition, the giant slalom, she finished in 10th position in the seated women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first position of the Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the 9th position of the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female skiers in the seated category were unable to finish their races and 45 out of the total 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not qualify for the competition.
The police of Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General, Mr. K. Arya, said, "We arrested five people who raped the woman of Swiss nationality and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused respond to the names of Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki explained that the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Despite there being three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extricated the driver of the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya appeared before the Edinburgh Sheriff Court accused of murdering his son.
He is held in custody pending the filing of charges and trial, but any evidence from the witnesses could be altered due to the extensive publication of his image.
This is a common practice in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice works differently and according to the courts' consideration, the publication of the photos could potentially be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee points out "journalists seem to be following a dangerous line when they publish photos, etc. of the suspects".
The Crown Office, which generally handles judicial processes, told journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the charges are formalized.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the dispute over the borders, which the Palestinians demand to be based on the pre-1967 Six-Day War borders.
Other issues allegedly addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which has sacred significance for both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while PA accepts to maintain that presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control test would be closely supervised by guards, during the test supervision and evaluation of its effectiveness.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were hired as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage for NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation were given comprehensive safety guidelines and training.
Martelly invested yesterday in the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) integrated by nine people.
It is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the prior resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
Martelly responded to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October with the commission.
At times, violent protesters were frustrated by the impossibility of holding elections, some pending since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPod failures due to overheating were reported, which caused a total of six fires and resulted in minor burns for four people.
The Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan stated that they were aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple informed it of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company classified as "not serious".
The Ministry responded by qualifying as "truly regrettable" that Apple postponed the report.
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The emergency management agency of the Northern Mariana Islands stated that no damages were reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that no tsunami notification was recorded.
A former Filipino policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Great number of hostages were rescued and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were initially released, as well as the photographers from the Philippines.
Subsequently, the photographers were replaced by an elderly woman who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Liggins began studying premature births in his free time while working at the hospital.
His research showed that by administering the hormone, the maturation of the fetus's lungs would be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators recovered the two flight recorders: the "black boxes".
The fellow fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first Queen of 'Extreme'. My first representative. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. Something extraordinary, almost like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as strange as me...maybe even more...love her and will miss her...hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
The acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard expressed during the campaign for the 2010 federal elections that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of participants in the survey share the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The holder of the Olympic gold medal was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to problems with his fitness, it's up in the air.
He couldn't take the medication he needs to cope with the pain because it's prohibited in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number to date.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February, a fact that was made known on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were the origin of the arrival of water on Earth along with organic matter that can create proteins and sustain life.
The scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, especially how Earth formed, as comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his term as governor this year and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriages.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
It is rumored that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA ensures would allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, instead of older ground radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to locate an aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more precise information.
Extra transport is not being offered and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley; surface parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available.
The fears about the lack of transportation opened up the possibility that the game would have to be held behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
The researchers from the University of Princeton in the USA and the University of Uppsala in Sweden pointed out that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it is thought that this process took much longer due to the breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch (geospiza fortis) and a cactus finch from Espanola (geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be molded into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can transform into a fine thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can also be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be reduced to a minimum thickness and stuck to other metals. Its thickness can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted frames, called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. An indicator can be created using the juice of a red cabbage.
The cabbage changes color depending on the degree of acidity or alkalinity (base) of the chemical substance.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
The ions of hydroxide are protons from which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry ingredients and then, with clean and moist hands, shape them into a ball.
The moisture from the hands will react with the outer layers, which will give a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a cistern in practically every house, connected to an advanced sanitation system.
In the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remains of sewage systems were found.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets sometimes formed part of public bathhouses, shared equally by men and women.
When calling someone who is thousands of kilometers away, a satellite is being used.
The satellite in space receives the call and then immediately bounces it back.
A rocket launched the satellite into space. Scientists use telescopes in space, because Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is necessary to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel did for us is to offer easier and faster methods of transportation.
They gave us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Underneath these, there are more medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including pet cats in freedom) that eat a lot more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the idea of the niche, specialized work that each cat has assigned and prevents them from competing with each other.
The lions are the most social felines and live in large groups, called prides.
The herds are composed of between one and three adult males who are related, along with up to thirty females and young.
The females are usually related to each other, as they are part of a large family of sisters and daughters.
The pride of lions act in a very similar way to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (although not to other large felines) in their behavior and also highly deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can stalk (though not very well), swim, leap long distances, and strike with a force five times stronger than a strong human.
The tiger is included in the same group ("genus panthera") as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that have the ability to roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full roar of a lion, but rather a phrase with words growled in shouts.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds, if they can. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
The scientists believe that ocelots hunt and find animals to eat (prey) using their sense of smell, sniffing where they have moved on the ground.
They can see very well in the darkness thanks to their night vision and also move silently. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which they come (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were previously.
This new environment has different resources and different competencies, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they needed to be up to that point.
The original population has not changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
With the passage of time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it also begins to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will have such a different appearance that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that we can exhale (that is, expel through breath).
The plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and also make clothes with them. Most of the food we consume also is. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the ultimate predator of its time and was afraid of nothing, except other mosasaurs.
His long jaw was adorned with more than 70 teeth sharp as knives, plus an additional set on the roof of his mouth, which meant that nothing that crossed his path stood a chance.
We can't know for sure, but it's possible that it had a bifid tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it's even possible that it was cannibalistic.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-rex would not be a rival for it.
Despite the fact that most of their foods would be familiar to us, the Romans had a handful of elements for strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting in chairs, rich men liked to celebrate banquets together where they could recline on one side while eating.
The meals of ancient Rome could not include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have maize, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor coconuts, and no ancient Roman ever tried turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a primary temple that was considered the home of that deity.
People offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to attend to their needs through ceremonies and festivals.
All temples have an open courtyard, and then an internal sanctuary that only priests can access.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called "ziggurats," were built to be integrated as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, houses were not as important.
The majority of the life of Hebrew families developed in the open air.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were simple open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the region of Canaan there were no important forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas it is told that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for committing a murder and that, while traveling west, he found a territory which he named Greenland.
Despite its discovery, the Inuit tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian", there were many distinctions between the people, the kings, the traditions, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie The Search, you probably think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not correct. Even if something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" appeared on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text appears at the bottom of the document upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence, that document on a large parchment (measuring 29¾ by 24½ inches) was stored rolled up.
So, it is likely that this annotation will simply be added as a label.
The D-Day landing and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south remained invaded.
It was governed by the French from "Vichy". These were French who agreed to peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of confronting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation forces liberated the south of France and were heading towards the Germans.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a sizable group of people who live and work cooperatively: a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", which means civil, related to the Latin "civis", which means citizen, and "civitas", which means city or city-state, and which also, to some extent, defines the size of a society.
The city-states are the ones that give rise to nations. A civilized culture means that knowledge is passed down through different generations, a lasting cultural legacy, and considerable dissemination.
Minor civilizations often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as civilizations in their own right.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first created a weak central government (composed solely of Congress) under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to impose taxes and, as there was no national executive or legislative for the application of all its laws, it depended on state authorities, who often refused to cooperate.
He did not have the authority to invalidate fiscal legislation or state tariffs either.
The articles required unanimous approval from all states before they could be modified, but the states took the government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian team, along with the German team, are the second most successful team in the world and were champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Some popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 competition.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, while Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that make it up, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago."
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when European navigators passing by recorded the name of the island as "Formosa Island" or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established their base in southwest Taiwan, thus initiating the transformation of production practices among the local indigenous people and providing employment to Chinese workers who worked in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared the country a province of the Qing empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely, Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally were.
In 1976, 30% of the restoration of Machu Picchu had already been completed, which continues until today.
For example, the most common fixed photographic image format in the world is 35 mm, which was the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more important is the aspect ratio relationship inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format, in fact and to create more confusion, measures 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Thus, it is said that the aspect ratio of this format (when divided by twelve, a ratio of the simplest whole number is obtained) is 3:2.
Different common formats (the APS format family, for example) are the same or very close to this aspect ratio.
The excessively traveled and often ridiculous rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamic while maintaining some order in an image.
Establish that the most effective position for the main subject is found at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For thousands of years, the Christian religion has united European states despite differences in languages and customs.
His dominant power in all areas affected the whole world, from the king to the commoner.
One of the fundamental principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used for the relief of suffering and poverty, and that the monetary funds of the church exist specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was Rome for a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question if this vow was being fulfilled.
Immediately after the start of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, by cutting off vital civilian and military supplies, even though this blockade violated the general international acceptance law codified by many international agreements in the last two decades.
Great Britain seeded international waters with mines to prevent any ship from entering entire areas of the ocean, even endangering neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany was expecting a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among the majority of citizens and nations was pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horror and atrocities committed during the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to live in the United States of America where he accepted a job with the Edison Company in the city of New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter recommending him from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his last job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was an exclusive method to show the different time periods; each era of China or each family that came to power was a particular dynasty.
Likewise, between each of the dynasties there was a period of instability with the division of provinces. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods of time, a fierce war occurred between different nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dead fighting to sit at the highest position in the grand palace of Xi'an.
It had many social and political consequences; for example, the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Likewise, after the Revolution, occupations were open to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and determined to achieve success.
The same thing happens with the military, because the army ranks, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mahoma had a great interest in matters related to the afterlife. He often went to a cave that became known as "Hirana" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
That same cave, which survived the passage of time, provides an intense image of Mohammad's spiritual tendencies.
Located on one of the mountains of Meca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to discover at all if one knew it existed. Inside the cave, the isolation is complete.
You can see nothing but the beautiful clear sky above the numerous mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramidal structures that were constructed in honor of the death of the pharaoh.
The Guiza Plateau or "Guiza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt contains many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, while a large number of other pyramids, tombs, and smaller temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
The "arco arriba" mark looks like a V and the "arco abaixo" mark looks like a staple or a square missing the bottom half.
Up means to start at the tip and push the bow, while down means to start at the heel (where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The upward movement of the bow normally produces a smoother sound, while the downward movement is more intense and assertive.
You can write your own annotations, but do not forget that the printed marks on the bow are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a multitude of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, 11 years old, and Louis Charles, 4 years old), as well as the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that was shouting and making threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At one point, a member of the mob beheaded a royal guard murdered in Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The bellicose expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They had the obligation to pay taxes to the US colonial regime in order to cover most of the expenses and the interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Filipino government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Of course, the extraordinary benefits resulting from the long exploitation of the Filipino people would be the basic achievements of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which those events occurred is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history that includes the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000 to 1300).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological drive or technological imperative to a narrow sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two main ideas: that technology development itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that motor cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are designed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The ownership of mass vehicles also generates a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism contained an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to that geographical context emerged, which, being in harmony with the place of that society, proved better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the capital of fashion of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a cradle of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
His status declined during the 12th century, primarily due to the fact that the returning crusaders brought gifts such as silk and spices that were more valued than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was during this time that the title of fashion capital changed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th or 11th and the 14th centuries.
At first, the clothing was very influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, as a result of the slowness of communication channels, Western styles could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to create its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten their clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is carried out to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, usually organic, that uses native seeds saved from that ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, farmers worked in subsistence agriculture and it is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures gather individuals with similar mindset who feel ignored by the norms of society and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive by the age, ethnic origin, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine the differences of a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of all these factors.
The members of a subculture often make their association evident through distinctive and symbolic use of a style, including fashion, way of acting, and outlook.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to use the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, tragedy, or deliberate mistreatment, were not socialized by adults as they were growing up.
These children are called "wild" or wild. Some wild children have been confined by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of these children is due to the rejection by their parents of their severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the feral children experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others were allegedly raised by animals; some say they lived solitary lives away from civilization.
When raised by non-human animals, wild children show behaviors (within their physical limits) almost completely identical to that particular animal that took care of them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the state goes a step further.
The method itself is not a way of learning, but rather a kind of support that provides assistance to individuals who are undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program, or starting a new project.
The stays can be both virtual and real, that is, the teacher is a form of stay, but so is the little man clip in Microsoft Office.
The virtual stamens are internalized in the software and their purpose is to question, provoke and explain procedures that could be difficult for the student to face alone.
The minors enter into foster care for a wide range of different reasons, which can range from abandonment and abuse to blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not enriching, affectionate, and educational, but it happens.
We perceive the reception system without adoption as a safe zone for these kids.
It is assumed that our foster care system provides safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
The adoption in foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that are missing in the home from which they were removed.
Internet combines elements of Mass communication as well as interpersonal communication.
The particular characteristics of the Internet led to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important motivations in the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivating factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to fundamental discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for milliseconds.
It is claimed that it is possible to detect when a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how people who lack the ability to comprehend speech as a result of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately determine sincerity.
It even suggests that these abilities of interpreting human behavior could be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
The research conducted in the 20th century showed that there are two reserves of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection eliminates it from the set of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variations up and down between both reserves in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet their amino acid requirements from existing plants.
In addition, not doing so has serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and vegetables, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large amount of protein that contains all essential amino acids.
Taking everything into account, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a relatively similar way to chimpanzees on the savannah today.
The interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally waking up during the normal sleep period and then falling back asleep shortly thereafter (between 10 and 60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a relatively quiet alarm clock that helps to regain consciousness without fully waking up.
If you find yourself constantly snoozing the alarm without waking up, you can place it at the other end of the room, to force yourself to get up and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking a lot of fluids (particularly water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before going to bed, forcing you to get up to pee.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present life force will be. All people have the potential to find peace and complete satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve a state of enlightenment. The only obstacle that stands between us and this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism builds on the teachings of Buddha, but these were expanded through the Mahayana path of love, as well as through many techniques of Indian yoga.
In the beginning, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path to love that encompasses everything.
Through Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (illuminating energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through the visualization of the different deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are reactivated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, clashes between systems, processes, and culture led to disagreement between the countries.
After two years since the end of the war, the former allies have now turned into enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next forty years and was fought in reality, through representative armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and other different places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize at the head of the Romanesque bridge.
However, those plans became obsolete overnight when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Non-Aggression Pact between Russia and Poland, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for the transportation of goods is, by far, the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and cargo across the ocean.
The function of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that the country maintains the ability to transport people and goods while interfering with the enemy's ability to move their own.
One of the most recent notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using U-boats, tried to halt that traffic.
If the allies had failed, Germany probably would have conquered Great Britain in the same way it had done in the rest of Europe.
It is believed that goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them to have easy access to milk, fur, meat, and leather.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended to by goatherds who were often slaves or adolescents, in a similar fashion to the more commonly known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
The "waggonways" (horse-drawn carts on rails) were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the wagonways consisted simply of parallel wooden boards, this allowed horses to pull them to achieve higher speeds and to move heavier loads through the slightly more rudimentary roads of the time.
The sleepers were introduced very early to secure the tracks in place. However, gradually, it became evident that the tracks would be much more efficient if they had an iron piece on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused a stronger wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels replaced the iron ones. In 1767, the first completely iron spokes were introduced.
The first known method of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of homo erectus (which means "upright man").
His predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as is usual.
The specialization in bipedalism is found in the fossils of the Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more respectful way towards the environment, we can join a movement to defend the environment, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, it amounts to treating the symptoms. However, if we do not want a purely temporary solution, we should seek the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is more than evident that the world has changed considerably as a result of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and problems have increased due to overpopulation and the excessive lifestyle of human beings.
After the Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a couple of streets away to John Dunlap's printing house.
That same night, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was performed by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. Another additional copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 known Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of that document. The original handwritten document did not survive.
Different paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. They are called birds.
Many people do not consider them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
These birds present many characteristics still very similar to those of the dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs just like T-rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, that is, 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits or bits in the language of computer science.
It's possible that internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so generic that it's impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household substances.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term has its origins in the classic familiarity with bedbugs, insects with a great ability to adapt to parasitize humans.
Both fleas and bed bugs are bloodsuckers, adapted to living in their own nest or in that of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research discovered that women have twice the likelihood of suffering from multiple sclerosis than men.
A couple can decide that having a child does not benefit them or the child.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to determine the functioning of the world through scientific methods. This method, in fact, guides the majority of scientific research.
It is not only through experimentation, but the experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and observations that guide scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, and particularly on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's opinion was accepted in all matters related to science, including psychology.
As the wisdom of the Greeks declined, the West distanced itself from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often have a vital dependence on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
There are documented periodic rhythms, which are nothing more than responses to external periodic patterns, in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free running even in the absence of external cues.
The experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase was one of the leading suggestions that DNA constitutes genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They carried out two experiments in which they labeled either the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have multiple different effects depending on their type, the relevance of the compromised genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ line cells.
Only mutations in germ line cells are prone to be transmitted to offspring, while mutations in other areas can lead to cell death or cancer.
Tourism focused on nature attracts people interested in visiting natural spaces to enjoy the landscape, as well as the fauna and flora.
Examples of "in situ" activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird-watching, and visiting parks, as well as studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, taking photos, and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural villages by car to go to their workplace, crossing paths with others whose work destination is the same place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transportation service, everyone is somehow connected and supports the private vehicle-based transportation system.
Science today shows that this massively coal-dependent economy changed the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses means of transportation. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, a similar level of complaints about water quality or bridge collapse is rarely heard.
Why do transportation systems generate these kinds of complaints? Why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there some other more fundamental problem?
The traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and private vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they maintain with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within reasonably consistent boundaries; therefore, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
For a better representation of traffic flow, relationships were established between its three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan and design traffic service operations.
The insects were the first to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to escape from enemies more easily and to find food and mates in a more effective way.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings against the body.
This offers them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the devil's horses and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought I was right, but many others thought otherwise; the Solar System was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems logical, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and most voluminous river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a width of six miles.
20% of the total water from the planet's rivers that flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon has a length of 6,387 km (3980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite the fact that stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they were never surpassed in size or technical superiority by those of Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest number of inhabitants.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
The Italian language is also commonly used by the majority of people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Humanity has known the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times, as they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but the theory was also formulated that they transform into new substances that give shape to what we see.
The axes are, basically, a mixture of two or more materials. It should not be forgotten that the periodic table includes many elements.
The elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is composed of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
In this way, the pencil became a good friend for many people at the time of its invention.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower condition and uses.
Now people write messages on computer screens without ever needing to reach for a pencil.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something new replaces it.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to unite a core with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to dragging a heavy cart uphill. When splitting the nucleus again, it releases part of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable cores, that is, they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of approximately 70 km in the nearest area and 100 km in the furthest area.
It is thinner under the sea zones and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there is more lava on the nearest side, because the bark is thinner. The lava found it easier to rise to the surface.
The theories about contents focus on researching what motivates people or what they find attractive.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalized as they matured and became adults.
These theories study what makes certain people want certain things and what things in their environment will lead them to perform or not perform certain actions.
Two popular theories about content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general terms, two types of behaviors can occur when managers start leading their former colleagues. At one extreme, they will try to continue being "just another colleague" (or coworker).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and demanding accountability from people.
On the other side of the coin, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who believes that they must change everything the team has done and adopt it as their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behaviour often creates divisions between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The virtual teams respond at the same levels of excellence as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
The members of virtual teams often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They usually have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as their teams will be able to meet depending on different time zones, which the national management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) also constitutes an exclusive component of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the management group that each member answers to. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the slow process of establishing a learning-promoting organization? One of the goals of implementing the concepts of organizational learning is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can result in a new innovation process that responds to the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as share knowledge and learning as an organization.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach in cognition research. This narrows the research area and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the research of scientists.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The extension of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before seen.
This offers a great deal of information and material that allows us to build simulation models to help us understand the process in our mind.
Although AI has strong shades of science fiction, it constitutes an important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The research in artificial intelligence seeks for machines to automate activities that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to patient diagnosis and questions, as well as recognition of writing, voice, and face.
This type of things have become independent disciplines, which seek to provide solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, as it has been integrated into multiple domestic software applications and video games.
Excursions are a very important part of any classroom. Teachers often love taking their students to places that are not reachable by bus.
Technology offers the solution through virtual school visits. Students can see the museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art from their desks.
Sharing a virtual school trip can also be a great way to reflect on the trip and the experiences shared with other classes in the future.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; every year the website is remodeled, but previous versions are stored online to act as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often start their experiences with blogs showing poor grammar and spelling skills, generally, the presence of an audience makes them change.
When students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts to make an effort to improve their writing and avoid criticism.
In addition, maintaining a blog "obliges students to learn more about the world around them." The need to feed the interests of the public inspires students to show their intelligence and be interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that promotes collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
An appropriate use of blogs "empowers students to have a more analytical and critical spirit; by offering an active response to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the text written by others, as well as define their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the lovely bilingual capital of Canada that has a selection of art galleries and museums where you can contemplate the country's past and present.
More to the south are the Niágara waterfalls and the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and many more make Ontario an example of what foreigners consider inherently Canadian.
Large areas along the north are sparsely populated and many are practically uninhabited wild areas.
Here's a comparison on populations that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean on the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and most unique continent in terms of its flora and fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and famous as luxury holiday destinations on the beach.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region that settled deeply in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Women traveling here are recommended to claim to be married, regardless of their marital status.
It can also be useful to wear a wedding ring (that doesn't look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences could result in something they would consider harassment, and it is common for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Show firmness in rejecting men and do not be afraid to assert your position (whether it be due to cultural differences or not, it is not acceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sailors in the 10th century BC and used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as the White House, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city with the name Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants, who established trading posts there, named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
In the outskirts of the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as textiles, ceramics, leather goods, "hookahs" and a wide range of trinkets, but all of this is aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and most of the city's streets, especially in the center, were left buried.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside the city should be researched to know the state of the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province.
Likewise, the city is the base from which one can ascend to the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as some of the most affordable mountain gorilla treks in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use boda-boda (mototaxi). The normal price (locally) is approximately 500 Congolese francs for that short trip.
Together with its relative inaccessibility, the term Timbuktu in English has become a metaphor for exotic and remote islands.
At present, Timbuktu is a very poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it also has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites at risk, due to the threat to the desert area.
It constituted one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special about the Wonders of the African World.
The city offers a stark contrast with the rest of the country, due to its more Arab than African atmosphere.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northwest of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each maintaining different fauna and flora.
This is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African national parks (SANParks).
Just like in other South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees to the park.
It is likely that it will also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which offers access to either a selection of parks in South Africa or all the National Parks of South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the entire territory and is the place that many tourists consider as the most relevant.
The parade of buildings that define the skyline in Hong Kong has been compared to a shining bar graph made evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, you will have to leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite shore.
The vast majority of the urban development on the island of Hong Kong is densely concentrated on land reclaimed from the sea on the northern coast.
The British colonizers adopted this place as their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial history of the territory, this is a good starting point.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt on the planet, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest located in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not mere mangrove swamps: they include some of the last strongholds of the imposing jungles that once covered the genetic plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², of which approximately one third is covered by water and marshes.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for wildlife and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and almost 30,000 spotted deer in that area.
The buses leave from the inter-district bus station (crossing the river) uninterrupted throughout the day, but the majority, particularly those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 am and 7:30 am.
Since buses between districts typically run full, it is recommended to purchase the ticket in advance.
Most districts have the service of small Japanese Coaster buses, comfortable and sturdy vehicles.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient method for traveling to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Both towers reach a height of 83 meters, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The bridge span underneath is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when it is anticipated that Brazilian customs controls will be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group that inhabited what is now known as eastern Paraguay; they lived as seminomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the guaycurú and payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "the giant province of the Indies," was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous native groups.
The period of colonization initiated by the Spanish lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain to a large extent its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Here too smaller tournaments and matches can be witnessed during other times of the year.
To obtain information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, you can consult with the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), whose value is fixed in equivalence with the pound sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store.
The pound sterling in general is accepted on all the islands and in Stanley itself, credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
In the outskirts islands, credit cards probably won't be accepted, although British and American coins will be accepted; it should be discussed with the owners in advance to determine the most acceptable payment method.
It is practically impossible to exchange currency from the Falkland Islands outside of the islands, so it is recommended to make the exchange before leaving.
When Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months temperatures above +30 °C are common.
The winter can be disappointingly cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to create a feeling of colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year.
Despite many of the animals in the park being accustomed to the presence of humans, they are all wild fauna and should not be fed or bothered.
The park management recommends maintaining a minimum distance of 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from other wild animals.
It doesn't matter how docile they may seem: bison, moose, bears and practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries for not maintaining a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so space should be left for them.
In addition, it should be taken into account that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so it is necessary to avoid bringing or cooking foods that smell and to keep the camping area clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of only 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the place where the infamous naval confrontation occurred in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to abandon it.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence led by the Mau movement, a peaceful demonstration in the city ended with the assassination of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to the fact that Auckland is situated between two ports, it has many beaches. The most popular ones are distributed in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and go from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
All are safe sandy beaches for swimming and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Bay, in the stylish residential neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They tend to be very crowded family beaches with a good variety of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The most famous local beer is "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is called "Manta".
There are many types of French wines to choose from, but probably New Zealand and Australian wines better withstand the travels.
The local tap water can be safely drank, but bottled water is easy to find in case of doubt.
For Australians, the idea of a "café con leche" is foreign. A coffee is just an "espresso", cappuccino has a layer of whipped cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
The chocolate in the cup meets Belgian expectations. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are organized throughout the year and injuries caused by those reasons in the reefs are rare.
However, the advice of the authorities must be followed, the indications of the signs must be complied with, and special attention must be paid to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish are found near the beaches and river estuaries between the months of October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside of that season.
The springs exist; however, they rarely attack humans. Most springs are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is found in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance provides peace of mind to the traveler, knowing that they will have a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents usually have offers with specific hotels, although it may also be possible to book other types of accommodations, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport or even combined packages of plane and hotel.
You can also keep the reservation if you need time to evaluate the offer or look for other documents for the destination (e.g. visas).
However, any modification or request must be processed first through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, most attendees decide to camp within the festival grounds and consider it a fundamental part of the experience.
In order to be closer to the action, it will be necessary to arrive early in order to secure a camping spot near the music.
It should not be forgotten that even though the music may end on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play music well into the early hours of the morning.
Some festivals have camping areas specifically for families with young children.
If crossing the northern Baltic during winter, it will be necessary to check the location of the cabin, as the crossing through the ice generates an extremely unpleasant noise that affects some people more.
The cruises to St. Petersburg include some time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from requiring a visa (conditions apply).
Casinos usually make a great effort to maximize the time and money spent by guests. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
There are usually special offers of food, drinks and entertainment to ensure that the guests are in a good mood and stay on the premises.
In some places, alcoholic drinks are offered for free. However, drunkenness clouds judgement and all good players are aware of the importance of staying sober.
People who are going to drive at high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or below-zero temperatures.
On icy or snowy roads, the friction is low, so you cannot drive in the same way as you would on normal asphalt.
During a brief period of time in a very short space, enough snow can fall to become trapped.
Visibility can also be reduced by snow or sleet or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic remains virtually uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest attraction for tourism in Africa and the most prominent for many visitors.
The term safari is widely used to refer to trips on land to see the impressive African wildlife, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, come very close to the cars, so a normal team will allow to obtain a good vision.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes show themselves to be timid, so the best way to see them will be with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "mountain walk", "hiking safari" or "going for a run") consists of hiking, for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some of the events will take place in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, after hosting the games in 1964.
If the flights and accommodation for 2020 were booked before the announcement of the postponement, the situation may become complicated.
The cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, the majority of cancellations due to coronavirus will not extend beyond July 2020, the scheduled date for the Olympics.
It is expected that the majority of tickets for the event will cost between 2500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, with the average ticket cost around 7000 ¥.
Ironing the wet clothes can help dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for use, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no clothes iron available or if you don't feel like ironing your socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you have one.
Do not let the material overheat (this can cause it to become sticky or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some of them more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil the water for one minute, while in others it is necessary to do it for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, so if in doubt, you should consider buying water in sealed bottles from an accredited company.
Travelers may encounter pests of animals with which they are not familiar in their regions of origin.
The pests can spoil food, cause discomfort or, in the worst cases, provoke allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals capable of injuring or killing people using force are generally not considered plagues.
Shopping at Duty Free is an opportunity to acquire items free of taxes and consumption duties in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxation may be able to save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often passes through isolated land in the middle of nowhere.
If you are not used to driving on secondary roads, stay calm: steep slopes, narrow paths, and tight curves are predominant.
The indicated speed limits are considerably lower than those of previous and subsequent sections (generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) and their strict compliance is even more important than otherwise.
However, it is curious that the mobile phone service has more coverage here than in other parts of the route, for example, in Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German pastries are quite good and, in Bavaria, are quite sweet and varied, similar to those of their neighbors to the south: Austria.
The fruit pastries are common, with apples cooked in the filling throughout the year, with cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many German pastry products also include almonds, hazelnuts, and other types of dried fruits. Popular cookies often pair perfectly with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want to try some hard and consistent pastries, try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, combined with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.

Currently easily available throughout the archipelago, Xava's cuisine includes a range of dishes with simple seasonings, with the favorite predominant flavors of the Xavanese being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Xava coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on each side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability for the rider, but they can present safety issues due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting trapped in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and their foot gets stuck in the stirrup, they could be dragged by the horse if it takes off running. To minimize this risk, there are a series of safety precautions that can be adopted.
Firstly, most drivers wear high-heeled boots with a smooth and quite narrow sole.
After, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to fall from the saddle when pulled backward in the event of a rider fall.
The Cochamó Valley, Chile's main destination for climbing, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks have stunning views. Climbers from all over the world continuously establish new routes among their walls of infinite potential.
Alpine snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular and involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard on your feet.
Skiing is a significant travel activity, with many enthusiasts, occasionally referred to as "ski bums", who plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings representing skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also called ski touring, ski touring or trekking skiing.
It is related, although it usually does not involve alpine skiing tourism or mountaineering, since the latter is done on steep terrain and requires much harder skis and boots.
The ski route should be considered similar to a hiking route.
In good conditions, slightly longer distances can be covered on foot, but speeds similar to cross-country skiing will only be reached occasionally without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would require applying for different visas and going through multiple passport controls.
However, the Schengen area in that sense functions to a certain extent as a single country.
Whenever staying in this area, generally you can cross the border without having to go through passport control points again.
In the same way, by having a Schengen visa, it is not necessary to apply for visas for each member country of the Schengen agreement separately, so time, money, and paperwork are saved.
There is no universal definition that determines which manufactured objects are considered an antique. Some tax agencies define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies geographically, with the limit of antiquity potentially being lower in places like North America than it would be in Europe.
The handicraft products could be defined as antiques, although they are more recent than similar items produced on a large scale.
The reindeer breeding is an important means of livelihood among the Sámi and the culture surrounding their trade is also important for many other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sami people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, primarily taking care of reindeer as draft animals.
At present, many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.

The views presented are generally superficial, general and excessively simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather conditions is a generic term for any type of dangerous atmospheric phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
The extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types, which will depend on the geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
The gusts of wind, mist, excessive precipitation, and forest fires are forms and effects of extreme weather conditions, just like thunderstorms, tornadoes, water spouts, and cyclones.
Some serious regional and seasonal atmospheric phenomena include droughts, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly encouraged to check for any severe adverse weather conditions that may affect their area, as this could impact their travel plans.
Any person considering visiting a country considered potentially as a conflict zone should obtain professional training.
A search on the Internet for a "Hostile Media Course" will likely find the address of a local company.

A course will typically last between 2 and 5 days and will include role-playing games, many first aid exercises, and sometimes, weapons training.
The books and magazines that deal with survival in the wild nature are common, but the publications that talk about war zones are less so.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents to travel back.
The will of the governments when issuing passports without indicating the gender (X) or updated documents to correspond with a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to fulfill these documents also varies considerably.
The security checks at airports also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not had surgery will not be required to go through scanners to preserve their privacy and dignity.
The return currents are the flow that returns from the waves after breaking against the beach, usually against a reef or similar.
Due to the topology of the underground waters, the flow of return concentrates in a few deeper sections and it is possible that a fast current towards the deep waters may form from that point.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
It should be attempted again in an area where there is no possibility of getting trapped or, depending on the ability to swim and if you have already been spotted, wait to be rescued.
The shock of the return occurs before the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to readapt to their original culture.
Returning home after living abroad, one has already adapted to the new culture and lost some of their own habits.

The sphinx appears as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids, which all light up.
Many countries claim the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819. These are home to the largest number of bases, with sixteen of them active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other include Livingston Island and Deception, where the water-filled crater of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region to the south of the peninsula that borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge here with the plains to then rise again and form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, with Mount Vinson in the Vinson Range reaching 4892 m.
In remote locations, without mobile phone coverage, it is likely that a satellite phone is the only possible option.
Satellite phones are not generally a substitute for mobile phones, as it is necessary to be outdoors with a direct line to the satellite in order to make a call.
This service is frequently used for making shipments, including recreational boats, as well as expeditions that need remote data and voice.
The local phone service provider should be able to offer more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those considering taking a sabbatical year is to go on a trip and learn.
This is particularly popular among those who finish school, as they can take a gap year before entering university, without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can actually improve the chances of accessing higher education in the home country.
In general, a registration fee is applied to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, it is not necessary to have a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are undoubtedly large enough for any type of yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak allow for a different kind of experience.
Sailing is the national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
The same happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but overall it is quite exceptional (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include an extension of the stay in St. Petersburg (Russia).
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days and then return to the boat to sleep at night.
If you only plan to go ashore with shore excursions, you will not need an additional visa (from 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin (Germany) in their brochures. As you can see on the previous map, Berlin is far from the sea and visits to the city are not included in the cost of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.

For some, understanding something about the functioning of the airplane and what happens during a flight could help them overcome the fear that is based on the unknown or not having control.
Courier companies receive a good payment for delivering articles quickly. Often, time is very important when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
In some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and for smaller companies this posed a problem.
Things were sent by airmail, it was possible that in certain routes it would take several days to clear customs.
The only way to make it arrive earlier was to send it as checked baggage. But the regulations of the airlines prohibit sending baggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
An obvious way to fly first class or business class is by shelling out a lot of money for the privilege (or even better, getting the company to pay for it).
However, it is not cheap: as a rough rule, you could end up paying four times the price of a regular business ticket and up to eleven times for a first class ticket!
In general, it is not worth looking for discounts on business class or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know perfectly well that there is an exclusive group of passengers willing to pay exorbitant prices for the privilege of reaching their destination quickly and comfortably, at the corresponding cost.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, although Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered due to ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistria Republic in western Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but no UN member country recognizes it.
The economic ties have been restored between those two parts of Moldova despite the failed political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

This place must be treated with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Making jokes about the Holocaust and the Nazis is prohibited.
Prohibited to deteriorate the environment with marks or scratches painted on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Castilian. Almost half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, which most people understand, and almost everyone knows Castilian.
However, most signs are written exclusively in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.

The regular announcements on the metro are made only in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are announced through an automated system in a wide range of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The Parisians have the reputation of being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although often the subject of an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris still remains by maintaining good behavior and acting as someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make getting around the city considerably easier.
The abrupt exterior of Parisians will quickly evaporate if some basic courtesy manners are shown.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park has a dense forest cover, principally of beech trees, different types of spruces like firs and false firs, and a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a considerably wide variety of plant communities, due to its extensive range of microclimates, different soils and variety of altitudes.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animals and bird species.
Here you can find exotic wildlife such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wildcats, and grouse, as well as many other common species.
During visits to the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer cloths for women who do not come prepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
In the same way, men should wear pants that cover them to the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the pile at the entrance, but that clothing is not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing those skirts. One size fits all for men!
The Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (pork, in particular) and uses olive oil for everything.

However, people who know some Spanish might jump to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is similar enough to not have to study it separately.
The premodern observatories are generally obsolete today and are preserved as museums or educational centers.
Given that at its peak moment, light pollution did not pose the problem that it does at present, it is usually found in cities or campuses, which were much easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes consist of gigantic facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Contemplating the blooming of the cherry blossoms, known as "hanami," has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where the plum tree shoots were the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were celebrated by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
The plants are more beautiful when they are in their natural environment, so one must resist the temptation to even pick "just one" specimen.
When visiting a garden with a formal design, collecting "samples" will result in immediate expulsion, without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to visit where it is very easy to navigate; you can also buy practically anything once you are there.
Nevertheless, being located in the "high tropic" just a few degrees north of the Equator, you will have to adapt to both the (constant) heat and intense sun (when the sky is clear, which is less common).
There are also some buses that go north towards Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.

Many of the traditions surrounding this celebration have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending the Easter night in vigil in an open place to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is likely to be a pre-Christian ritual to exalt spring and fertility.
The most traditional churches often celebrate a Easter vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, after which congregations usually break into a celebration at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that arrived at the islands in their origins did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey so the giant tortoise became the first grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience the polar night, that is, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This presents an excellent opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky will be dark for practically 24 hours.
As those areas are sparsely populated and light pollution, as a result, is not likely to be a problem, one can enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are accustomed to.
Suits are a standard business attire and coworkers address each other by last name or by their job title.
