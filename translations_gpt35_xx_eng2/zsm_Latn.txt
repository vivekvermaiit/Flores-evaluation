This not only confirms that certain dinosaurs had feathers, a widely spread theory, but also provides specific details that generally cannot be determined from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists say that the animal's fur is brown on the top and pale or carotenoid in color at the bottom.
The study also provides insights into the evolution of feather plumes in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have well-developed structures called barbs, but have other feather features - spines and barbules - researchers concluded that barbs are likely an evolutionary development of these other features that came later.
The feather structure suggests that it is not used for flying but more for temperature control or display. Researchers suggest, although the tail is from a young dinosaur, the samples show the feathers belong to an adult, not a young one.
The researchers suggested that, although it is a young dinosaur tail, the sample shows adult feathers and not downy chick feathers.

The work is mostly done theoretically, but the program is written to simulate observations made on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team is caused by the gravitational interaction between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just like how the moon exerts gravitational force on the Earth and causes tides, so does the Milky Way exert force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists can conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as regular matter.
This theory states that dark matter is scattered throughout the galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made up of many small particles.

He was then transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya is now in Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of killing her child.
He is in temporary detention awaiting charges and trial, but any witness evidence may be tainted as his picture has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK but the administration of justice in Scotland is different and the court considers that publishing the photo may cause prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee stated, "Journalists are like walking in dangerous territory when publishing photos and other belongings of suspects."
The Crown Office, responsible for the overall prosecution, has informed journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the prosecution.
Based on leaked documents, the document refers to the border dispute claimed by Palestine based on the pre-1967 Middle East War border.
Other topics covered in the report include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands the continuous presence of troops in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to the presence of troops for only five years.
Shooters in the attempt of additional pest control need to be closely supervised by the rangers, while the attempt is monitored and evaluated for its effectiveness.
Under the partnership between NPWS and the Australian National Rifle Association (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are recruited under the hunting program of the Rifle Association.
According to Mick O’Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conversation and Heritage with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Martelly took an oath in the new Temporary Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of nine members last night.
It is CEP fifth Martelly within four years.
The President's Commission last month recommended the previous CEP's resignation as part of the move to push the country towards implementing new elections.
The commission is Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime riots that began in October.
The protest, sometimes violent, has occurred due to the failure to hold elections, some since 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods that were too hot have been reported, causing six fires and four people to suffer minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan stated that they are aware of 27 accidents associated with the device.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 incidents of excessive heating, but the company deemed it "not serious."
The Ministry has responded by calling the delay in Apple's report "very disappointing".
An earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands reported that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there are no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has turned Hong Kong tourists into hostages by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired shots from an M16 rifle towards the tourists.
A number of hostages have been saved and at least six have been confirmed killed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, have been released earlier, as well as a Filipino photographer.
The photographer then took the place of the old lady because he needed to use the restroom. Mendoza has been shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in the field of medicine.
He was trained as an obstetric specialist and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature childbirth in his free time.
His research shows that if hormones are administered, it will accelerate the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two flight recorders "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Other members of the council also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna is the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away two months ago. Pretty unique like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels reviewed "Luna, as strange as me... maybe more... love her and will miss her... may she be placed in heaven."
Out of the 1,400 people who were surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of them in this survey are of the opinion, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last king of Australia.
In the extreme end of the public opinion poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible while 31 percent believe that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist should have competed in the 100m and 200m freestyle events as well as in three relay races in the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have led many to doubt his fitness.
He cannot take the necessary medicine to control his pain because it has been prohibited from the Competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of water delivery to Earth as well as organic materials that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed, since comets collided with the Earth at some time in the past.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his duties as governor earlier this year and has signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political discussions and nonsense".
He is speculated to become the president in 2016.
NextGen is an FAA demand system that will enable aircraft to fly on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the old radar-based ground technology to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately track the location of aircraft and provide more precise information to pilots.
No additional transportation is provided and the overground train will not stop at Wembley, while car parking facilities and platform access are not available at the station.
Fear of inadequate transportation raises the possibility that the game will be conducted without team supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the Science journal reported on the formation of new bird species in the Galápagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species has evolved after only two generations, even though this process is believed to take longer, due to breeding between an endemic finch bird in Darwin, the Geospiza fortis, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into various forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can then be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be produced very thin and adheres to other metals. It can be made so thin that it can be used to decorate books with hand-painted designs called "interleaved manuscripts".
This is called chemical pH. You can produce indicators using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice will change color depending on how acidic or alkaline a chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (letter H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ion is a proton with an electron being removed (because a Hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Spread both dried powders and then, with clean wet hands, roll the powders into balls.
The liquid on the hands will react with the outer layer, which will feel strange and form a shell-like layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have public toilets in almost every house that are connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
The remains of the sewerage system have been found in the urban houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. During the Roman civilization, toilets became part of public bathhouses where men and women mingled freely.
When you contact someone who is thousands of miles away, it means you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space received a call and bounced it back down, almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in outer space because the Earth's atmosphere disrupts our visibility and lighting.
It took a giant rocket over 100 feet tall to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an extraordinary way. The greatest contribution of the wheel to us is the facilitation of easier and faster transportation.
He has brought us trains, cars, and many other modes of transportation.
Underneath them are more medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized animals from rabbits to deer and mousedeer.
Finally, there are many small-sized cats (including stray cats) that consume more small prey such as insects, rats, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, specific tasks for each cat that prevent them from competing with other cats.
The lion is the most social of cats, and lives in large groups called "prides".
A group of lions is formed from one to three adult males, together with around thirty females and their offspring.
Women are usually close to each other, as they consist of large extended family of female relatives and daughters.
Prides Lion act the same as a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are startlingly similar to lion behavior (but not big cats) and also very dangerous to their prey.
Ready to attack, tigers can climb (although not very well), swim, leap long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. Only these four types of cats can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, more like a jumble of words, a scream of words.
The ocelot tiger enjoys eating small animals. It will hunt monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if possible. Almost all the animals it hunts are much smaller in size than itself.
The scientists believe that the ocelot tiger tracks and hunts animals to be eaten (prey) through the sense of smell, i.e. by sniffing the ground it has passed through.
The ocelot can see well using night vision and also move slowly. The ocelot hunts its prey by hiding in surroundings that resemble its body color and then pouncing on its prey.
When a small group of living organisms (small population) becomes isolated from the main population from where they originated (for example, if they wander across mountains or rivers, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily move back), they often end up in a different environment than before.
This new environment contains different resources and competition, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to become stronger competitors than they needed before.
The original residents have not changed at all, they still need adaptation just like before.
From time to time, as new residents who are beginning to adjust to a new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other residents.
Finally, after thousands or millions of years, both populations will appear so different that they are no longer from the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that is inhaled by humans and take in carbon dioxide that is exhaled by humans (when breathing).
Plants produce food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our house from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is made from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, making it fearless of anything, except for other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw is equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an additional set located in its palate, which means there is no escape for anything that crosses its path.
We are not sure, it may have a forked tongue. Its diet includes turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even be a cannibal.
It also attacks anything that enters the water, even a giant dinosaur like T. rex will not be able to compete with it.
Although most of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans also have strange or unusual feast foods, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of mouse called dormouse.
Another difference is that while poor people and women eat their food while sitting in chairs, rich people like to have feasts together where they will relax by their side as they eat their food.
The ancient Roman cuisine could not possibly include the food brought to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they do not have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a Dutch chicken.
The people of Babylon have built a primary temple for each of their gods, considered as the home of the respective deity.
The public will make sacrifices to the gods and priests will try to fulfill the needs of the gods through various ceremonies and celebrations.
Every temple has an open temple courtyard and inner sanctum that is only accessible to the priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats are built to be part of those temples.
The top of the tower has become a protected area for the deity.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house is no longer so important.
Most of the life of Hebrew families takes place in an open environment.
The women are cooking in the yard; the shop only serves as an open counter facing the street. Stones have been used to build the house.
There are no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood is a very expensive resource.
Greenland is sparsely populated. According to Norse saga, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, without any regard to his discovery, the Eskimo tribe settled there at that time.
Although each country belongs to 'Scandinavia', there are many differences in terms of the people, kings, culture, and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have ever watched the movie 'National Treasure', you might have thought about a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, the matter is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The original Declaration of Independence is dated July 4, 1776. The text is written below the document, upside down.
While no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that in the early part of his life, this large document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, it is possible that the notations are only added as labels.
The D-Day landing and subsequent battles have liberated northern France, but the southern part is still not liberated.
It was ruled by "Vichy" France. They were French citizens who made a peace agreement with Germany in 1940 and chose to collaborate with the colonizers rather than oppose them.
On 15 August 1944, the Allies attacked southern France, this attack was called "Operation Dragoon".
Only within two weeks, the American and Free French armies have liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization originated from the Latin word civilis, meaning public, which is related to Civis Latin, meaning citizen, and civitas which means city or metropolis, and it also however defines the size of a society.
The state-city is the beginning of a country. The culture of civilization signifies the spread of knowledge from generation to generation, the traces of culture that always exist, and fair distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as a complete civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with Congress as its sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The congress does not have the authority to impose taxes and, due to the absence of a national judiciary executive, it relies on the state's power, which often does not cooperate, to enforce all its acts.
It also does not have the right to refuse tax laws and interstate tariffs.
This article requires unanimous agreement from all districts before they can surpass and take over the central government as their representatives are often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern region, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands owned by the State of Japan, Japan, from a geographical standpoint, is usually referred to as an archipelago.
As early as the 15th century, Taiwan was already being observed and recorded by European traders who referred to the island as IIha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, bringing about a transformation in the indigenous grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work in rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) army seized the west and north coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan as a territory of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, where it ceded authority over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the old buildings have been restored to give tourists an idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu will have been restored and restoration work has continued until today.
For example, the most common image in the photography world is the 35mm format, which is equivalent to the dominant size of film at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced until now, but more importantly, the aspect ratio has been inherited by the digital camera image sensor format.
The actual 35mm format is quite confusing, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided into twelve to obtain the easiest overall ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many standard formats (such as the APS family format) are the same or almost the same as this aspect ratio.
One third of the frequently misused and mocked rules are concise guidelines that create dynamism while maintaining a sense of order in the image.
It states that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (refer to the example).
During this time in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become very wealthy and powerful, began to be doubted.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound the European countries together despite the differences in language and customs.
The absolute power greatly affects everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the main cores of Christianity is that wealth should be used to reduce poverty and suffering, and church financial funds are specifically for that purpose.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years and the power and wealth caused many to question whether this belief has been fulfilled.
Not long after the outbreak of the battle, Britain began naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy in question has been proven effective in cutting off crucial supplies to the military and civilians, despite this restriction not conforming to the universally accepted international laws established by several international agreements two centuries ago.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering certain parts of the ocean, posing danger even to regular vessels.
Since there has been a response to this tactic, Germany expects the same response with unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the common attitude for most people and countries was one of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horror and oppression of war during World War I, some countries want to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job offer with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a certificate from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods, each stage of China or each powerful family at that time had their own dynasty.
Among each dynasty, there were also times of unstable and fragmented territories. The most famous during this time was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During that period, intense warfare broke out among several nobles vying for the throne.
Three Kingdoms is a bloody era in the history of Ancient China where thousands of people died fighting to sit on the highest throne in the grand palace in Xi'an.
Various social and political impacts will arise such as the implementation of the metric system, the transition from absolute monarchy to a republic system, and the awareness and spirit of nationalism that the country belongs to the people and not a single leader.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, job opportunities were opened to all male applicants, allowing those with the highest ambition and success to succeed.
Similarly, with the military, the position of the soldiers is now based on their caliber instead of their class.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad SAW was very interested in matters beyond ordinary life. He often visited a cave later known as "Hira" on Mount Noor (light) to contemplate.
He carved out himself, to endure forever, providing a very clear image of the spiritual tendencies of Muhammad.
Located at the top of a mountain in northern Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is actually not easy to find even if someone knows of its existence. After stepping into this cave, it is completely quiet.
There is nothing to be seen except the bright and beautiful sky and the towering mountains around it. Only the whispers of the world can be heard or seen from inside this cave.
The great pyramid at Giza is one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.
Built by the people of Egypt in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many pyramid structures built to commemorate the deceased Pharaohs.
At the Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, there are several pyramids (including the largest pyramid), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
Many large pyramids were built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wife and family members.
The "upstroke" sign is similar to the letter V and the "downstroke" sign is similar to a square or rectangle shape without the bottom part.
On top means, you need to start from the end and push the bow, and on bottom means, you need to start at the frog (the part where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A up bow typically produces a soft sound while a down-bow produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Free to write your own notes, but do remember that the music notes printed there are for musical purposes. Therefore, they should always be respected.
King Louis XVI, who was frightened, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a group of women in the market on October 6, 1789.
Riding on horseback, they returned to Paris and were surrounded by a group of people screaming and shouting threats to the King and Queen.
The group of rioters has forced the King and Queen to open their chariot window wide.
At one time, a rioter raised the head of the royal guard who was killed in Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The imperialist war expenses of the U.S. to conquer the Philippines have been paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They have to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States of America to bear a large part of the expenses and floating bond interest on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the great benefits of continuous exploitation of the Filipino people will be the basic advantage of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one needs to understand the context that has sparked the formation of the relevant order.
The period in which the events usually known as the High Middle Ages occurred is the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000 -1300).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses various ideas practiced, from technological advancements or technological priority to the firm belief that human destiny is driven by the logic related to scientific laws manifested through technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two main ideas: that technological development itself follows a path independent of cultural or political influences, and that technology also has "effects" on the existing society, rather than the other way around.
For example, one might say that motor vehicles lead to the development of highways.
However, the road network throughout the country is not capable of advancing for only a few cars, so a new method of production is being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The high car ownership also leads to an increase in road accidents, leading to the creation of new techniques in health care to rehabilitate injured body parts.
Romanticism has a strong element of cultural determinism, inspired by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and with time, customs and cultures related to this geography emerge. And this, which is more in harmony with the position of society, is better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way, Paris is known as the center of contemporary world fashion, while Constantinople is considered the center of feudal European fashion.
It is known as a center of luxury starting around 400 AD and lasting until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, primarily due to the Crusaders who returned with gifts such as silk and valuable spices worth more than what was offered in the Byzantine market.
At this time, the exchange of the Fashion Model title from Constantinople to Paris is being carried out.
Gothic style peaked during the period between the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, the western style may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
As the Middle Ages drew to a close, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments at that time due to the crusades was the widespread use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Self-sustaining agriculture is the type of farming conducted to produce food for the needs of farmers and their families.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple system, usually organic, that uses saved seeds originating from a specific ecological area and combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
According to history, most farmers are involved in agriculture as a means of livelihood, and this is still a reality in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by societal standards and allow them to develop their own identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished based on age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of its members.
The quality that determines the different branches of culture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, sexual politics, geography or a combination of factors.
Members of a cultural branch usually display their membership through specific styles symbolically, whether in the form of fashion, behavior, and language.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to consider several cases of child neglect, accidents, or intentional abuse, not being social with adults when they grow up.
Children like that are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of these children is caused by parents rejecting the severe intellectual or physical disability of the child.
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Other children are claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the jungle.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child will exhibit behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely like the animals that raised them, such as fearfulness or indifference towards humans.
Even though project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more engaging, scaffolding provides more than that.
Scaffolding is not a way of learning but rather a support that provides support to individuals undergoing new learning experiences, such as using new computer programs or starting a new project.
The scaffold can be either virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffold and so is the small paper clip in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and acts to question, assist, and explain procedures that the student may find difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed with foster families for various reasons including neglect, abuse, and also for the purpose of exploitation.
No child should have to grow up in an environment with no caregivers, caring for and educating them, but they do.
We see the Maintenance System as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Caregiving should provide all the needs that cannot be provided at home where the child is taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet bring an additional dimension in terms of user engagement and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "imprisonment" are suggested as important motivations for Internet usage (James et al, 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continued relationship" have been identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro expressions, facial movements lasting several milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can detect whether someone is lying by interpreting subtle changes in facial expressions accurately.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper "The President's Speech," shows how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He proposes that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
The twentieth century study has shown that there are two types of genetic variation groups: hidden and visible.
New genetic changes with additional mutations and selection produce a set of prominent changes.
Separation and recombination reshape the variation between two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is very difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet their amino acid needs from the available plant sources.
Furthermore, failure to do so will have serious consequences: increased depression, unhealthy eating habits, and ultimately lead to death.
The most readily available source of plants is the protein found in leaves and nuts, but this is difficult to digest by primates like us unless it is cooked.
On the contrary, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digested, but it provides high quantities of protein that contain all essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors dealt with their "protein problem" in the same way the chimps in the savanna are doing today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a silent alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself constantly hitting the snooze button on your alarm, try placing it on the other side of the room to force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
The choice based on other biorythms involving a lot of liquid beverages (mainly water or tea, unknown diuretics) before sleep, forces someone to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the pressure, the more positive life spirit will be present. Everyone has the potential to seek true peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can attain awareness. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own pressure and negative nature.
The Tibetan Buddhist religion is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been extended with the path of Mahayana love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism has very simple principles. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a comprehensive path of love.
The Kundalini energy (the energy of consciousness) is activated through Kundalini Yoga with yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The foundation of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Deities. Depicting various deities cleansing energy channels, activating chakras, and internal awareness being manifested.
Germany was a common enemy during World War 2, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the US. Ultimately, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures caused those countries to argue.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies have turned into enemies and the Cold War begins.
It will last for 40 years and will be fought in a tangible manner by proxy armies on the battlefield from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
As September 17th, 1939 approached, Poland's defense had been crushed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, after 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and established the Belarus and Ukraine fronts after attacking the eastern territories of Poland by violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Poland Non-Aggression Treaty, and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
Using a ship to transport goods is the most efficient method for moving large amounts of people and goods across the seas.
Traditionally, the navy's task is to ensure your country's ability to move people and goods, while disrupting your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most famous recent examples of this is the WWII North Atlantic campaign. Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using U-boats, was trying to disrupt the traffic.
If the Perikatan party has failed, Germany may be able to conquer Britain just like other parts of Europe.
The goat seems to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Culture and ancient people began breeding it to obtain milk, fur, meat, and skin more easily.
Domestic goats are generally kept in wandering herds on hills or other grazing fields, often tended by goat herders who are usually children or teenagers, similar to the shepherds more commonly known today. This herding method is still used until today.
The carriage has been built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the train tracks consisted of only parallel wooden planks, it allowed the horses to pull it to achieve higher speeds and carry heavier loads compared to rough roads during that time.
The crossover tie was introduced quite early to support the local track. However, it was realized that the track would be more efficient if there were iron rails on the top part.
This has become a habit, yet the iron has made the wooden wheels of the cart become worn out.
Gradually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron track was launched.
The first known form of transportation is walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their supervisors, the Australopithecus, do not usually walk upright.
The specialization of bipedalism is found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living with care for the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce suffering in the future to some extent.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, then we must find the root of the problem and eradicate it.
It is quite clear that the world is changing significantly due to the advancements in scientific and technological human advancements, leading to bigger problems caused by overpopulation and extravagant human lifestyles.
After being accepted by the congress on the 4th of July, the written draft signed by President of the congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap located a few blocks away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first reading of this document to the public was by John Nixon at the Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which was read to his troops in New York on July 9. The copy reached London on August 10.
There are still 25 wide side book copies of Dunlap known to exist, which are the oldest surviving documents. The original handwritten copies no longer exist.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still living. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider it to be a dinosaur because it has feathers and can fly.
However, there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
It has scaly and clawed feet, laying eggs, and walking on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary form.
Binary numbers can only contain one of two values, which are 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary numbers, or bits, in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning cannot be quickly proven. Symptoms such as vomiting are quite common and cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of open medication leftovers or toxic household cleaning materials.
Check the label for specific emergency instructions for that specific poison.
The term "pepijat" is used by entomologists formally for this group of insects.
This term originates from ancient practice with "pepijat", which is an insect that has adapted well to become a human parasite.
Both assassin bugs and ants are altruistic, adapting to living in nests or dwelling places.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurologic disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to suffer from MS as men.
The husband and wife can decide that it is not the best for them or in the best interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In the process of adopting a child, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can take over as the parents of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world functions through scientific methods. These methods actually guide most scientific research.
It is not alone, experimentation and experiment are tests used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalist and philosopher focus on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
The reviews of Aristotle have been accepted in all scientific matters, including psychology.
When knowledge of the Greek language declined, the Western world found themselves unable to study the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior usually depend heavily on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through the biological clock.
Rhythmic oscillations, which are not just a response to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is an autonomous oscillator that will continue the cycle period even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment is one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase have used a phage, or virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two tests to determine whether the DNA in the phage was marked with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutation has various effects that differ depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the cells involved are bacterial cells.
Only mutations in germ line cells can be inherited by children, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people to visit natural areas with the aim of enjoying the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Example activities that can be done include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks as well as learning information about the ecosystem.
The example is visiting, taking pictures, and learning about the indigenous people in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small towns to the city for work and are overtaken by others whose destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation ecosystem, everyone, in any way, is involved in and supports the private car-based transportation system.
Science now shows that the large carbon economy has released the biosphere from one of its stable states and has supported human evolution for two million years.
Every person participates in the association and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why does the transportation system result in such complaints, why does it fail to function every day? Is it due to inefficient transportation engineers? Or is there something wrong at the fundamental level?
Traffic flow is a study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, traffic flow analysis is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave somewhat consistently; therefore, traffic flow is also somewhat consistent and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To represent a better traffic flow, a connection has been established between the three main features: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps in planning, designing, and operating highway facilities.
Insects are the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helps them to easily avoid enemies and to search for food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings back to the side of their body.
This gives them a large area with small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Many thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people think he is correct but many believe otherwise; that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and also other stars).
This makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the amount of water compared to the second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, measuring six miles across.
20 percent of the abundant water from the rivers on this planet flows into the oceans from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It gathers water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids continued to use stones until the end of the old kingdom, the Giza pyramid never exceeded the size and technical brilliance of their construction.
The new ancient Egyptian government admires their predecessors' monument, which is over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian language in its laws and official communications.
Italian language is the daily language used by most of those who work in the country whereas Latin language is typically used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
The people have been aware of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as these can all be found in nature in their original forms and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, has proposed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of four or more elements. It is earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it is also theorized that they can change into new substances to form what we see.
Aloi is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered as metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of an atom is so small that several trillion of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil is a good companion to many people when it is created.
Unfortunately, when newer writing methods emerged, the pencil was demoted to a very low status and usage.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens, without having to be close to a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer emerges.
The splitting bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pulling a heavy cart up the hill. Separating the nucleus once again and then releasing a little of that energy.
Certain atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means it can separate with little or no touch.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the earth's crust.
The crust has a thickness of 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner below the sea and thicker beneath high ground.
There may be more cracks in the nearby area because the crust is thinner. It becomes easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
The theory of content focuses on finding what makes people click or appeal to them.
These theories indicate that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are inherent when they reach maturity as adults.
These theories look at what is within a person that makes them desire the things they desire and the factors in their environment that will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors can arise when managers start to lead their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is an attempt to remain part of the old friend group.
Managers like this face difficulty in making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary actions, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, one will transform into an unrecognizable individual who feels the need to change everything the team has done and put their personal touch.
Leaders are responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often causes conflict between the leader and other group members.
The virtual team is held to the same standard of excellence as conventional teams, with only minor differences.
The members of the online team often serve as a point of contact for the nearby physical group.
They usually have more autonomy than conventional team members because their team might operate in different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of the "unseen team" is indeed a unique component of a virtual team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
"The unseen team" is a management team where all members report. This unseen team sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to engage in time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal for practicing the concept of organizational learning is innovation.
When all resources are effectively utilized across every functional part of an organization, creativity and intelligence can occur.
The result, a collaborative organizational process to overcome obstacles can lead to new innovative processes to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as sharing knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theory-based approach to cognitive investigation. Consequently, it refines the field of research, making it more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, trauma, wounds, and tumors will affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The existence of new technology allows us to observe and investigate the structure of the brain and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build a simulation model which helps us to understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations with science fiction, AI forms a very important branch in computer science, dealing with attitude, learning, and smart adjustment in machines.
Research in AI involves the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
For example, this includes control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose customer responses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Matters like this have become a separate discipline, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, as built into several home computers and video game software applications.
Study visits are a big part of any classroom. Often, a teacher wants to take their students to a place that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual visits. Students can view museum artifacts, visit the aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing virtual visits is the best way to showcase the visit and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their visits to the state capital, and every year the website will be updated, but the old version will be saved online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with grammar and spelling mistakes, the presence of an audience can generally change that.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger started to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Writing a blog also "forces students to be more aware of the world around them." The need to engage the readers' interest inspires students to write wisely and attractively (Toto, 2004).
Writing a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond traditional school days.
The appropriate use of blogs "can provide opportunities for students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to internet material, students can determine their position in the context of others' writing and also outline their own perspectives on related issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the bilingual capital city of Canada that is charming with various art galleries and museums displaying Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls and the northern part is the natural beauty area of Muskoka and the untouched.
All these and many more highlight Ontario as the true Canadian experience for visitors from abroad.
Some large areas in the northern part are quite sparsely populated and some are virgin forests with almost no inhabitants.
For a surprising comparison of population: There are more African Americans living in the US than the population of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean on the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and the continent alone when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are separate countries, or associated with France, and known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arab people also brought Islam to this land and it has rapidly developed in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and colonization of Europe began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
This region borders the Sahel in the north and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women: It is recommended for female travelers to state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring has its advantages (but not a ring that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may result in what they perceive as harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting people, and do not be afraid to stand strong (cultural differences or not, it does not matter!).
The modern city of Casablanca was discovered by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by Phoenician, Roman, and Merenid people as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese people destroyed it and rebuilt it with the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city of Daru I-Badya and named it Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established a business base there.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places for shopping in the Maghreb.
It is easy to find places that sell traditional Maghribi goods around the old Medina such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, shisha, and various small jewelry, but it is only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from Mount Nyiragongo, which engulfed much of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is quite secure, any visits outside of Goma should be carefully assessed to understand the ongoing conflict situation in the North Kivu region.
This city also serves as a base for hiking the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla treks in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to explore Goma. The usual price (for locals) is ~500 Congolese Francs for that short trip.
Combined with its difficult-to-reach location, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for a distant and exotic land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites, due to the threat of desertification.
This is one of the primary stops during the PBS special program "Wonders of the African World" with Henry Louis Gates.
This city is different from other cities in the country, because it has more of an Arab style than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and along the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500km² and is divided into 14 different ecosystems, each supporting various wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the pride of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all national parks in South Africa, there is conservation and entrance fees for the park every day.
It can also provide benefits to one to purchase the Wild Card, which provides entry to either the parks of South Africa or all National Parks of South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives the territory its name and is considered a primary focus by many travelers.
The row of buildings that adorn the Hong Kong skyline is likened to a glittering checkered chart that becomes increasingly interspersed with the reflection of Victoria Harbour waters.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The majority of urban development in the Hong Kong islands is dense on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that was taken by the English colonialists as their own, and if you are looking for evidence of the history of colonialism in this area, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, covering an area of 80 km (50 miles) from the coastal shoreline deep into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The portion of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forest is not only mangrove trees - it also includes some of the last remaining areas of discarded jungle forests covering the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², where one third is covered by water/marsh areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a protected area for wildlife and is now estimated to have as many as 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer living in the area.
The bus departs from the bus station in the area (across the river) throughout the day, although most of them especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06.30 and 07.30.
Because the bus between districts is always full, it is advised to buy tickets several days in advance.
Most areas have the reliable and comfortable Japan Coast Guard Bus service.
Sharing a taxi is a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It connects the Oyapock River with the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Both towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to fully operational in September 2017, when the expected completion of the Brazilian customs inspection facility.
The Guaraní people are the most prominent indigenous group occupying the area now known as Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practice subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous ethnic groups such as Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survive by hunting, gathering plants and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once called the "Giant Indian Territory", was born as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquistadors with the indigenous native groups.
The Spanish started a colonization period that lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has successfully preserved the character and identity of its indigenous people.
Argentina is very famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.

The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP) which is pegged at par with the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in this island located in Stanley, across from FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere in the islands and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also usually accepted.
In remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency can be used; check with the owner beforehand to determine what payment methods are acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it experiences summer there while it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures exceeding +30°C are common.
The cold season can be confusing: the temperature rarely exceeds freezing point, but the wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer reading.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons, the amount of rain is more or less consistent throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, maintain a distance of 100 ell/meters from bears and wolves and 25 ell/meters from all other wild animals!
How gentle their appearance, bison, deer, moose, bear, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain the proper distance. These animals are very large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be cautious because strong smells can attract the attention of bears and other wild animals. Therefore, avoid bringing or cooking strong-smelling food and always maintain cleanliness in the camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu with a population of less than 40,000.

Some places offer alcoholic drinks at home. However, getting drunk can impair judgment, and all sane gamblers know how important it is to not be affected by alcohol.
Anyone who will be driving at high latitudes or crossing mountains should think about the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
The slippery and snowy road conditions cause low traction and you cannot drive as if you are driving on a dry pavement.
During a snowstorm, you can quickly get stranded and buried in snow.
The range of vision may also be limited by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the contrary, being covered in snow and cold is normal in most countries, and the traffic is mostly smooth throughout the year.
Safari is the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the peak for many visitors.
The term "safari" is popularly used to refer to a land journey to observe the captivating wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles and standard equipment that allow for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes feel scared and you will see these animals better using binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "footing") involves a journey, either for a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24th August to 5th September 2021. Some events will be held at various locations throughout Japan.

Travelers heading to states with heavy taxation can sometimes save money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont provides the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through remote wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be careful as steep grades, narrow lanes, and sharp bends dominate.
The announced speed limit is significantly lower than before and subsequent subsections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict compliance with them is even more important than before.
It is surprising that mobile phone service is stronger here than in other parts along the route, for example, Pennsylvania Wilds.
The pastries found in Germany are quite tasty, and the pastries in Bavaria are also quite sweet, fatty, and varied, similar to the pastries available in the neighboring southern country, Austria.
Fruit pastry is a common dish, with apples made into pastries all year round, as well as cherries and plums that come out during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. The popular cake is usually delicious when eaten with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small yet fatty pastries, you can try pastries named after their original region such as Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices cooked with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the rural areas of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry; in South India and some coastal areas of the small continent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a umbrella term encompassing a variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, if used unqualified, the term refers to food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
