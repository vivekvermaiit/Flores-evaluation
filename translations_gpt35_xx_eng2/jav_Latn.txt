This is not only about whether there is a dinosaur with feathers, a theory that has been popular, yet overall there is still no fossil that can be used as evidence, such as color and three-dimensional shape.
The scientist said that the fruit of this plant is brownish with high fiber and pale or orange color of carotene at the bottom.

The comparison from the University of Princeton in the United States and the University of Uppsala in Sweden shows that new species arise only two generations, even though this process is believed to take longer, because there are among them endemik finches Darwin, Geospiza fortis, and a cactus finch struck, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into any shape. It can be rolled into small shapes.
This can be made into a very thin cable, which can be rolled up and inserted. It can also be twisted or made into sheets.
This can be made very thin, and adhere to another metal. This can be made very thin sometimes used for painting hand-drawn pictures in a book called "decorated manuscript".
This is called a pH chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice depends on the presence of acid or base (alkaline) compounds.
This pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ion is a proton with an attached electron (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).

When you find someone who has a mobile phone, you use a satellite.
The satellite is launched into space and then it orbits the earth with a certain distance.
The satellite was sent into space using a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and hinders their own observations.
An extremely large rocket, at least 100 feet tall, is needed to launch satellites or telescopes into the sky.
The world is changing in a good way. The biggest is to create vehicles that are easy and fast.
This has provided us with a train, car, and many other transportation facilities.
The afternoon is the time when the medium-sized cats eat medium-sized prey such as young deer and rabbits.
In conclusion, there are many small cats (including domestic cats) that eat smaller prey such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The key to success is the concept of positioning, a specific task that is carried out every moment to distinguish oneself from others.
The lion is the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
This lion group consists of one to three male adult lions, with around thirty female lions and their cubs.
Women lions usually have strong social relationships, so they form large families with female relatives and female offspring.
The lion behaves like a pack of wolves or hyenas, animals that natively fear lions (but are not large cats themselves), and are also deadly to them.
The athlete who is very smart, that tiger can jump (although not very good), run, and leap while carrying the weight of five people.
The tiger is a member of the group of animals of the same kind (Panthera) such as lions, leopards, and jaguars. The four cats mentioned are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's roar which is loud and roaring, but it is like a grating and squealing sound.
The ocelot enjoys eating small animals. They will hunt lizards, frogs, mice, and birds if they can. All the animals that the ocelot hunts are smaller than themselves.
The scientist thinks that ocelots hunt and catch other animals for food (especially) with their sharp teeth, ruling their place with a strong presence.
He can see clearly during the day and can also adjust to the darkness of night. The ocelot hunts its prey by blending in with its surroundings and then pouncing on the prey.
When a group of small living beings (small population) separate from the main population to where they originally come from (like if they all move through a line of mountains or rivers, or if they all move to a new island and then cannot easily move somewhere else) they will likely find themselves in a different environment than where they were before.
The new environment has different and competing sources, so the new population will need different appearances or adaptations to become stronger competitors than what was needed before.
The original mountain is still very dense forest, it still needs restoration that is similar to before.
Gradually, when the new population starts to adapt to their own environment, they will gradually not be seen and not mix with other populations.
Finally, after several decades or centuries, two populations will be very different and cannot be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of a new form of species. Speciation involves a sequence that cannot be bypassed and is a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that is inhaled by humans, and they absorb the carbon dioxide exhaled by humans (i.e., photosynthesis).
The process of making food from plants is done through photosynthesis. The process also provides oxygen.
We build houses from bamboo and make clothes from bamboo. The food we eat is bamboo. Without bamboo, we cannot survive.
Mosasaurus is the top predator of its time, so it's not afraid of anything, surpassing other mosasaurus.

Sometimes special towers resembling pyramids, called ziggurats, are built as part of a temple.
The top of the tower is a special protection board for the gods.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house is not very important.
There are many Hebrew families living in this region.
The woman was carrying a basket in the background; those shops only opened their trade tables facing the street. Stones were used to build the house.

If you've already watched the national movie Bandha, you can also think about the Bandha map written on the back of the Independence Declaration.
However, that's not correct. Although there is something written on the paper, it is not a treasure map.
The original text of the Declaration of Independence is written in the document below.
Although there is no one waiting with certainty for who wrote it, but it is expected when life begins, the large parchment document (measuring 29Â¾ inches by 24Â½ inches) is rolled up for storage.
Initially, it might seem overwhelming to add more details just for labeling.
The landing of D.Day and the subsequent battle have freed the north of France, but the south is not yet liberated.
This was led by the French "Vichy". They were French people who collaborated with the Germans in 1940 and worked for the colonizers instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the operation was called "Operation Dragoon".
Only in the second week, American and French troops liberated southern France and pushed back towards Germany.
Civilization is a common custom practiced by a large group of people who live and work together, which is called society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin word civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or urban area, which reflects how a society can also be measured.
The city is the heart of a country. Culture and civilization involve the inheritance of intergenerational knowledge, the preservation of enduring culture, and equitable distribution.
Cultural heritages that are small often disappear without historical evidence connecting and cannot be recognized as a civilization that once existed.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states formed a strong central government - with Congress as the only component - following the Articles of Confederation.
The congress does not have the power to levy taxes, and, because there is no national enforcement or judiciary, it hampers the national government, which is not cooperative, to carry out all actions.
This also does not have the authority to enforce tax and price regulations between countries.
All members of the state must agree to the article before it can be amended, and other state members may find it difficult to enter government positions because representatives often do not enter.

Japan consists of approximately 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
The cluster/group of islands that are in Japan, Japan is often called, in geographical terms, as a "cluster of islands" country.
Taiwan began in the 15th century when European fishermen discovered this beautiful island, known as Ilha Formosa.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southern Taiwan, which began the transformation of native wine production practices and employed Chinese laborers to work in the betel and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) conquered the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and made Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.

Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many buildings surrounding the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better understanding of the initial situation.
In 1976, thirty percent of Macchu Picchu had been restored and continued until now.
The standard photography format widely used in the world is 35mm, which is the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced until now, but the most important aspect is the rationality of the image sensor format inherited from digital camera.
35mm is actually, a bit confusing, the size is 36mm and 24mm.
The aspect of this format (specifically used for creating the most minimal number) is called 3:2.
The most common format (e.g. the format of APS family) is simple or requires this aspect.
The third rule most often neglected is the simple guidelines when creating dynamism also maintain a sense of order within the image.
This indicates that the most effective board for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the picture into three vertical and horizontal sections (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which was still wealthy and powerful, entered a period of decline.
More than a thousand years later, Christianity was able to unite European countries into one even though their language and culture are different.
This is all about the power that governs all people from kings to servants.
One of the principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to help the less fortunate and that the church exists for that reason.
The central church authority has known about Rome for a thousand years and this concentration of power and wealth makes many people wonder if this principle has been upheld.
Sanalika sakwise pecahe pamusuhan, Inggris miwiti pamblokiran angkatan laut tumrap Jerman. Translation: Meanwhile, tensions broke out in Europe with the British starting to blockade the German navy.
This policy is not effective, and it violates important military and civilian supply agreements that are generally regulated by some international treaties in the last two decades.
The English set up a minefield in international waters to prevent ships from entering the territorial sea, endangering neutral ships.
Because there is a warning issued for this plan, Germany hopes for a warning similar to the silent submarine war without boundaries.
During the 1920s, the actions carried out by citizens and the nation were to resist war and also isolation.

In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States because he received a job with the Edison Company in the city of New York.
He went to the United States only with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (a former colleague) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had an extraordinary way of marking time; each level of Chinese society or each family with power had its own distinctive dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there are times when the stability of the divided provinces is not stable. The most famous period of this is the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for about 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
This fierce battle occurred when many noble bloods fought for the throne.
The Telu Krajan is one of the most famous periods in ancient Chinese history, where people fought to sit on the highest throne in the Xi'an Grand Palace.
There is a great influence from social and political changes such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state is governed by all people, not just a single leader.
The Revolution of Work also opened up for all male applicants and is aimed at the most ambitious and successful people.
Those who are equal in the military because the rank of the soldiers is based on their own class they are now based on skills.
The French Revolution also gave inspiration to many working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad is very interested in matters that exist in his life in this world. He often goes to the cave now known as "Hira'" on Mount "Noor" (light) for meditation.
He himself is in his own cave, safe when giving a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
At the top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, this cave is really quiet away from the worldly noise.
However, it's not easy to forget even though I already understand about it. Basically, in and out, that's a total isolation.
There is no one who can fully grasp the beauty, the clarity up high, and the many mountains around it. Not many parts of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders that still exist until now.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the most important pyramid structures built to honor the deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, has several pyramids (where the largest pyramid is the biggest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor his family and relatives.

You must start from the top and descend down the stairs, and then you must start from the bottom and climb up (where your hands hold the stairs) and pull the mentioned stairs.
The curve above this notation can produce a smoother sound, and the sharp symbol on top of this notation can produce a stronger and more precise sound.
Do not just write in your own way, but remember that the notes are curved because of the music, so they must usually be obeyed.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two remaining children (Marie Theresa aged 11 and Louis Charles aged 8) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
In the carriage, she returned to the Paris accompanied by a group of confused people who kept whispering to the King and Queen.

The period when various conflicts are commonly called the High Middle Ages in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The middle of the High Middle Ages was marked by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
The determination of technology is the word that represents many thoughts for practice, from technology support or necessary technology to be present when the fate of humans is supported by thoughts that become the basis associated with scientific rules and their manifestation for technology.
The general opinion about technological determinism has two common interpretations: that the development of technology follows its own path independent of cultural or political influences, and that technology also has "effects" for societies that cannot be anticipated with social consequences.
For example, someone will be surprised if that machine becomes the foundation for developing roads.
However, the national road network should not only be for the economy but also for various vehicles, so that new production methods can be developed to support people's transportation.
Driving fast not only causes more accidents on the road, but also creates new techniques to maintain safety and repair damaged vehicles.
Romantic literary style has many elements of cultural determinism, as illustrated by authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and the unique customs and cultures related to that geography emerge, and this, in alignment with societal norms, is better than forced laws made arbitrarily.
Because Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern era, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of ancient Europe.
Metalworking for producing tools and utensils has been known and developed since around 400 A.D. and continued until around 1100 A.D.
Status was rejected when the role of the Crusader Warrior collapsed because the truth that the Crusader Warrior brought back was goods such as silk and spices with prices exceeding those offered by the Byzantine market.
At that time, the title of Fashion Capital was passed from Constantinople to Paris.
My Gothic style has a period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because the communication channels are limited, the lifestyle in the village can be left behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the European Middle Ages, fashion began to develop its own style. One of the influences of the customs that exist in this era is the influence of the crusades when many people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Farming self-reliance is farming carried out to produce sufficient food to meet the needs of farmers and their families.
Living sustainably is the easiest way, often organic, using original seeds stored for the combined ecoregion with crop rotation or the easiest way to increase.
The general condition of farmers is still facing challenges in their livelihoods and this is still prevalent in several developing countries.
Cultural branches need an individual who has the same mindset and feels not discriminated against due to social status and can provide a sense of identity.
Branches of culture can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, region, and/or gender of its members.
The quality that determines a particular branch of culture has to do with language, aesthetics, its connection to religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of factors.
Members of cultural branches often express their membership through different and symbolic styles, including clothing, behavior, and dialects.
The most common method used for drawing the importance of socialization is to utilize cases that are not beneficial for children, not considered, ignored, deliberately misused, not discussed with the younger generation.
Children like that are called "liar" or naughty. Some naughty children have been locked up by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, these children are abandoned because of the rejection of the elderly to the intellectual or physical damage of severely damaged children.
The naughty child can also already know how to be bullied when still a child or abandoned before going or leaving.
Others think they are taming animals; in fact, they are just living their own lives in the wild.
When raised by animals, the child exhibits wild behavior (with precise descriptions) just like the animals that raised him, such as a sense of wildness and also a lack of concern for humans.
When planning a project, it is better to make the planning easier and more detailed, as a step further back is more difficult.
Scaffolding is not a way of learning but a help that provides support for us who have the experience of learning something new such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher can be a form of scaffolding but also a small paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software and aimed to question, solicit, and clarify procedures that can challenge students to be able to handle it by themselves.
The children are living in Foster Care for various reasons such as being neglected, abused, and exploited.
There is no child who grows up in a family that does not care, nurture and educate, but they understand.
We feel that the Foster Care Protection System becomes a safety zone for these children.
The place of storage must provide a secure environment, be managed with love, supervised with discipline, and trusted with integrity.
The children's caretaker must fulfill all the needs that were lacking in the previous children.
The internet combines elements of group communication and interpersonal.
The characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage terminology and gratification approach.
The words "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Involvement of the individual and continuous connections are also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has produced important findings in the analysis of micro expressions, revealing what happens in just a few milliseconds.
With special precision, it is stated that someone can recognize if a person is lying through micro-expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," discusses the difficulty of people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage, even though they are quite rational at heart.
He even suggests that in the future, humans may also be governed by animals such as tigers.
The two decades of research shows that there are two distinct genetic clusters: divided and accused.
Mutation adds new genetic variations, and selection eliminates this from the population of variations that are expressed.
Segregation and random recombination of different types occur interchangeably between the two groups in each generation.
In general, primates have a digestive system similar to humans to meet their essential amino acid needs from readily available protein sources.
What's more, feeling unsuccessful like that creates real problems: depression, lack of nutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible source of nutrients is protein, which can be easily obtained from inside leaves and legumes, but these nutrients are not easily digested by primates such as humans until the food is cooked.
At first glance, animal food (ants, termites, caterpillars) is not easily digestible, but it contains high-quality protein that includes all the essential amino acids needed.
After being weighed, the orangutans themselves are not surprised that they can solve the "protein problem" in the same way as the chimpanzees in the jungle.
Sleep disturbance is the process that intentionally disrupts your normal sleep and can last for a period of 10-60 minutes.
This can be easily done using a slightly different alarm clock that can wake you up without shocking you.
If you wake up at midnight, you can turn on the light in the other room, so as not to disturb others.
The choice based on other biorythms is to drink plenty of water (especially water or tea, known to be good for refreshing the body) before sleeping, so that people will be refreshed.
The intensity of the inner satisfaction experienced by a person correlates directly with the level of balance in that person's body and mind.
I am grateful, I am strong in facing the challenges of life. Everyone can find peace and joy that radiates.
Every person can seek enlightenment. One of the obstacles in this pursuit is the tension and negativity that we ourselves possess.
The Tibetan Buddhist religion is based on the teachings of Buddhism, but developed through the path of Mahayana love and various methods of Indian Yoga.
The teachings of the Tibetan Buddhist prince are very simple. These teachings include Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a path to embrace all feelings of love.
Through Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the powerful energy) awakens through yoga postures, controlled breathing, mantras, and meditation.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga Deity. Through various visualizations of deities, energy is channeled, chakras are activated, and conscious awareness is created.
Germany actively participated in World War 2, fostering cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the end of the war, conflicting systems, processes, and cultures have caused many countries to collapse.
With the end of the two-year war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
This will continue for 40 years, hoping and will be fought with friends, by the powerful army, in the battlefield from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only option left was to retreat and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, this plan was made in secret, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army entered and formed Belarusian and Ukrainian troops to launch a brutal attack on the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, all bilateral and multilateral.
Using a ship to transport goods is the most effective way to move a large number of people and goods across the sea.
The traditional maritime power is intended to reflect in a way that suggests that your country is capable of taking care of people and goods, but at the same time, it threatens your enemies so that they cannot take care of people and goods.
One of the most notable events to come from this is the North Atlantic military operation for World War II. Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to assist England.
With the same enthusiasm, the German navy used U-boats, trying to decipher their tactics.
If the Allies fail, Germany might also be able to defeat England as well as the rest of Europe.

All people are responsible for participating in society and using the transportation system. We all should discuss about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you are very good at paying attention to the matters related to water quality or bridges.
Why does the transportation system keep disappointing people, why does the system fail every time? Is it that the transportation engineers are not competent? Or are there more fundamental issues?
Traffic flow is a lesson on the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
It was really dangerous, learning traffic rules is important because drivers cannot be predicted with certainty.
Fortunately, the bus drivers drive quite safely; however, the busy traffic has a balance that can be felt and can be measured mathematically.
