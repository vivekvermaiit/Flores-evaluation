This confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a popular theory, but it also provides details such as color and three-dimensional arrangement, which cannot be obtained from fossils.
According to scientists, the fur of this animal was chestnut on top and light or in the color of carrot underneath.
This discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Therefore, because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed central shaft, called a rachis, but have other feather features - barbs and barbules - scientists inferred that the rachis was probably a later stage in evolution than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flying, but for regulating temperature or for display. In the opinion of scientists, this is the plumage of an adult individual, not a chick, even though the tail belonged to a young dinosaur.
The researchers suggested that despite it being the tail of a young dinosaur, the feather sample indicates an adult individual, not a hatchling.

The work was mostly theoretical in nature, but the program was written for the purpose of simulating observations of the galaxy in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The sought-after effect would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon affects the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way also exerts its force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to draw the conclusion that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as standard matter.
This theory states that the majority of dark matter surrounds the galaxy like a kind of halo, composed of many small particles.

Candidates have the opportunity to send their representatives to observe each stage of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and in accordance with specified procedures.

Carpanedo participated in two individual races at the championships in addition to the Wednesday party.
The first competition was slalom, in which she did not finish the first run. The race ended with the same result for 36 out of 116 competitors.
She finished the second race (giant slalom) in tenth place in the women's sitting category with a total time of 4:41:30, which is 2:11:60 slower than the winner, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09:02 slower than ninth-placed Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers in the group of seated competitors did not finish the race, and 45 out of 117 skiers participating in the giant slalom were not classified.
The police from Madhya Pradesh have recovered a stolen laptop and a mobile phone.
Deputy General Inspector D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman, and we have recovered her cell phone and laptop."
The following persons were identified as the accused: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
Despite there being three people at home when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, suffered serious head injuries.
The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services were freeing the driver of the red Audi TT.
At the beginning, he was placed in James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Crown Court as a person accused of killing her son.
She is in custody, awaiting indictment and trial, but the testimony of eyewitnesses may be unreliable because her image has been widely publicized.
This is a common practice in other regions of Great Britain, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, with courts considering that publishing photographs can be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are entering dangerous territory by publishing photos of suspects, etc."
The Royal Bench Office, responsible for conducting investigations in general, has informed journalists that any further comments will be withheld at least until the filing of the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will concern the disputed borders that Palestine wants to restore to the state before the Six-Day War in 1967.
According to reports, other discussed topics concern the future status of Jerusalem, a holy city for both nations, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the PA only agrees to such presence for five years.
The shooters participating in the additional pest control test were to be closely supervised by foresters, as the test was being monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.
Qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the shooting sports program of the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Australian Sport Shooting Association (NSW).
Mick O'Flynn, director of security and heritage for NPSW park, believes that the four shooters chosen for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday in the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), which consists of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission proposed the dissolution of the previous Temporary Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to expedite new elections in the country.
The commission was Martelly's reaction to widely spread protests against the regime that began in October.
Protests taking a sometimes violent course were a consequence of the lack of elections, blocked in some cases since 2011.
Over 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods due to overheating have been reported, resulting in six fires and four people being lightly burned.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan stated that it was aware of 27 incidents related to devices.
Last week, the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, describing them as "not serious".
When Apple postponed the release of the report, the ministry described this decision as "very unfortunate".
An earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (or Friday at 21:19 Coordinated Universal Time).
The Northern Marianas Crisis Management Office reported that the country did not suffer any damage.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there are no indications of a tsunami.
The bus carrying tourists from Hong Kong was hijacked in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, by a former Filipino policeman who took the passengers as hostages.
Rolando Mendoza fired a rifle M16 at the tourists.
So far, several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been declared dead.
Filipino photographers and six hostages, including children and seniors, were released earlier.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly woman in need of a restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins used his free time to start researching premature birth.
His research showed that introducing the hormone would accelerate lung development in the fetus.
The Xinhua News Agency reported that on Wednesday, government investigators managed to recover the black boxes.
The wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tomy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. She died on the night of two moons, which was as extraordinary as she was. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Luna was just as crazy as I am... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... one can only hope that she is better now".
Before the federal elections in 2010, a survey was conducted among 1400 people and the percentage of people opposing the introduction of a republican system in Australia increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Supervising Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the respondents agree with this and want Queen Elizabeth to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extreme points of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle as well as in three relays during the Commonwealth Games, but because he was complaining about his condition, doubts arose about his expected results.
The necessary medications to combat the pain were prohibited by the regulations of the Olympics, so he could not take them.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different equipment and software by the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is assumed that comets delivered water to Earth along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and sustaining life.
Scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, especially how this process looked in the case of Earth, because comets collided with it a long time ago.
53-year-old Cuomo took over as governor earlier this year and, last month, ratified a law legalizing same-sex marriages.
He described these rumors as "political gibberish and nonsense”.
There are speculations that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would enable airplanes to fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
The use of satellite technology instead of older generation radar technology allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more detailed information.
There will be no additional transportation options, ground line trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and park-and-ride facilities will also be unavailable in the ground space.
The potential lack of transportation made it likely that the match would take place behind closed doors without the participation of the team's fans.
The study published on Thursday in the journal Science informs about the emergence of a new species of birds on the Galapagos Islands, which belong to Ecuador.
Scientists from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have announced that a new species emerged in just two generations, even though it was believed that this process took much longer based on the breeding of Darwin's finches, black darwins, cactus darwins, and large-beaked darwins.
Gold can be crafted into various shapes, even the smallest ones.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be twisted and woven. It can be pounded out or rolled into sheets.
They can be thinly spread and stuck to another metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books, called "illuminated manuscripts".
We call it the pH indicator of a chemical substance. Red cabbage juice has the ability to detect pH.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the number of hydrogen ions (letter "H" in the abbreviation "pH") contained in the substance being tested.
Jony wodoru to protony, które pozbawiono elektronów (atom wodoru składa się z jednego protonu oraz jednego elektronu). Ions of hydrogen are protons that have been stripped of electrons (a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders, then press them with clean wet hands, forming a ball.
Moisture on your hands will react with the external layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to modern sanitation.
Remains of a sewer system were discovered in the houses in the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also known in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets sometimes belonged to public baths, where men and women were together.
When you call a person who is thousands of miles away from you, you use a satellite.
The connection reaches the satellite in outer space, and then almost immediately bounces it back.
The rocket carried the satellite into space. Scientists use telescopes placed in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light, and therefore the image visible from the Earth.
Sending a satellite or telescope into space requires the use of a massive rocket over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in many amazing ways. Most importantly, it has enabled us to have much easier and faster transportation.
Without it, there would be no railway lines, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below are medium-sized cats, feeding on medium-sized prey: rabbits, antelopes, and even deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic ones) that eat a lot more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the niche, in the special task that each cat performs, making it unable to compete with others.
Lions are among the most social of all cats and live in large prides.
The lion pride consists of one, two, or three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming one big family of sisters and daughters.
Lion groups exhibit behavior similar to a wolf pack or a pack of dogs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other large cats) in terms of behavior and the deadly threat they pose to their prey.
The tiger, a well-built athlete, can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times better than a strong man.
The tiger, along with the lion, leopard, and jaguar, belongs to the genus Panthera. Only these four species of felines are capable of roaring.
The roar of a tiger is not as loud as a lion's, but rather resembles tangled, shouted words.
Ocelots enjoy small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds whenever possible. The majority of ocelot's victims are much smaller in size than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate prey by scent.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision ability and move stealthily. They hunt their prey by blending into the surroundings, then pouncing on their target.
In the case of separating a small group of living beings (a small population) from the main population from which they come (e.g. when moving over a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island without the possibility of easy retreat), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will have to develop new characteristics or adapt in such a way as to be able to effectively compete in their new environment.
The original population has not changed at all and still needs to adapt in the same way.
Over time, as the new population adapts to the new environment, they increasingly resemble other populations less and less.
In the end, when thousands or even millions of years pass, these two populations will differ so much from each other that it will be difficult to call them the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the creation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which people excrete (i.e. exhale).
Photosynthesis is the process in which plants use sunlight to produce nutrients. Plants also provide shade.
We produce our homes from plants, just like our clothing. Most of our food is also plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mozasaur was then the largest predator, so he feared only other mozasaurus.
In its elongated jaws, it had over 70 exceptionally sharp teeth, and additional dentition protruded from the palate, so in contact with it, the victims had no chance.
There is no absolute certainty, but he could have had a forked tongue. He fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, he could have even been a cannibal.
He did not hesitate to attack the victims in the water, and even such a huge dinosaur as T. rex had to feel respect for him.
Although we are familiar with most of the dishes that the Romans consumed, quite exotic dishes also appeared at their feasts, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and ground squirrel.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate their meals while sitting on stools, while the rich met at banquets, during which they ate in a semi-lying position.
Dishes in ancient Rome could not contain ingredients that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They did not know, for example, maize, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
In Babylon, each of the gods had a main temple devoted to them, which was considered their dwelling place.
People brought offerings to the gods, while the role of the priests was to take care of the divine needs through ceremonies and holidays.
Every temple had an open courtyard, behind which there was an inner sanctuary, accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built, which became part of temples.
The special sanctuary dedicated to the god was located at the top of the tower.
The house did not play a particularly significant role in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The majority of the lives of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
Women were cooking meals in the backyard, shops were just counters facing the street. Stones were used for building houses.
Since there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, the prices of wood were very high.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to Nordic sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for committing murder, and during his journey west he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Without detracting from his role as a discoverer, it must be noted that at that time, Eskimo tribes already inhabited this area.
Although each country could be described as "Scandinavian," Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differ from each other in terms of people, rulers, customs, and history.
If you have watched the movie "National Treasure," you might think that a map with the road to the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. There are some inscriptions on the back of the document, but it is not a map leading to treasures.
On the other side of the Declaration of Independence were the words: "The original Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776." The writing is at the bottom of the document, written upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but it is known that initially this large parchment document (measuring 29.75 by 24.5 inches) was hammered in for storage purposes.
As a result, it can be assumed that the annotation was added as a descriptive label.
The landings in Normandy and further battles led to the liberation of the northern part of France, but the south still remained under occupation.
The power in this was held by the French "Vichy". These were individuals from France who made peace with Germany in 1940 and collaborated with the aggressors instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies began the invasion of southern France, which was called "Operation Dragoon".
Two weeks were enough for the forces of the USA and Free France to liberate southern France and head towards Germany.
Civilization is one culture, common to a fairly large group of people who live and work together as a society.
The word "civilization" derives from the Latin "civilis", meaning "civil", related to the word "civis", meaning "citizen", and "civitas", meaning city or city-state, which also somewhat indicates the size of the community.
States-cities were prototypes of nations. The culture of civilization involves passing on knowledge through many generations, imprinting a lasting cultural legacy, and fair distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind significant historical evidence, so they cannot be considered true civilizations.
During the war for independence, thirteen states first formed a fragile central government - whose only element was Congress - based on the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the authority to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial body, it relied on state authorities, which often did not show a willingness to cooperate in enforcing all of their laws.
Furthermore, he did not have the authority to repeal the regulations and tax rates between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all states before any changes could be made, while the states treated the central government with such disdain that their representatives often did not attend.
Next to the German team, the Italian national football team is ranked second in the world football ranking, and in 2006, they won the FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports disciplines include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, and athletes from Italy participate in international tournaments and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7000 islands (of which the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands it possesses, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in a geographical sense.
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, which means beautiful island.
When in 1624 the Dutch East India Company established a trading post in southwestern Taiwan, it began implementing changes in indigenous grain production practices and employed Chinese workers to work on rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) troops took over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after suffering defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty government signed a treaty with Shimonoseki, handing over Taiwan to Japan, which would rule the island until 1945.
Within Machu Picchu, three main structures stand out: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
In order to better portray the original appearance of this place to visitors, most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex were subjected to reconstruction.
By 1976, one third of the city of Machu Picchu had been restored and the process is still ongoing.
For example, in photography, the most commonly used format is 35 mm, which is the most common size of film at the end of the era of analog films.
It is still being produced today, but the most important thing is that this image format has been transferred to the matrix formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format actually has a width of 36 mm and a height of 24 mm, which is quite misleading.
The aspect ratio for this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format group) are identical or closely resemble this aspect ratio.
The principle of the separation of powers is often misused or mocked, but it provides a simple guideline to help achieve dynamism without disrupting order.
It is stated that the ideal place for the main object is the point of intersection of the lines dividing the photo into three equal parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful and wealthy, came under close observation.
For a period longer than one millennium, the Christian religion provided a significant bond between European countries with different languages and customs.
His power was so all-encompassing that it affected everyone, from the king to the peasant.
One of the main dogmas of Christianity says that wealth should serve to help the suffering and the poor, and that church funds are to be allocated precisely for this purpose.
The main church authority has been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money begs the question of whether this doctrine is being upheld.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy effectively cut off key military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law as recorded in several international agreements concluded in the previous two centuries.
Great Britain has mined international waters to block access of ships to huge parts of the ocean, exposing even neutral floating units to danger.
This tactic met with limited reaction, so Germany expected a similar situation in the case of their ruthless underwater military operations.
The 1920s are characterized by the pacifist and isolationist stance of the majority of nations and citizens.
After the terrible and cruel experiences of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States for work at the Edison Company in New York.
He set foot on American soil with 4 cents in his pocket, a volume of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods were portrayed in a unique way; each stage in China or each ruling family constituted a separate dynasty.
During transitional periods of interregnum between the rule of successive dynasties, the provinces were plunged into turmoil and division. The period of the Three Kingdoms, spanning 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty, is the most well-known such period.
Many nobles vying for the throne clashed in fierce battles during those periods.
The Era of the Three Kingdoms is remembered in the ancient history of China as a period of great bloodshed; thousands of people died fighting for the supreme throne in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just to a single ruler.
After the Revolution, all male candidates had equal access to professions, which allowed those who showed the greatest ambition and agility to achieve success.
The same applies to the military, because army rankings formerly based on classes are now based on the sword.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start a revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in issues beyond his ordinary life. He often went to contemplate in the cave known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (mountain of light).
The preserved cave itself gives a very colorful idea of ​​the spiritual predilections of Mohammed.
The cave, located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
It is not easy to find her at all, even when someone knows of her existence. Absolute isolation awaits the newcomer inside the cave.
You can't see or hear much of the outside world from inside the cave.
The only one of the seven wonders of the world that has been preserved to this day is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built in the 3rd century BC, is one of many large pyramids built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
In the Giza plateau (also known as the necropolis in Giza) in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), several smaller tombs, several temples, and also the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Cheops, while many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed in honor of Cheops' wives and relatives.
The "up bow" symbol looks like the letter "V", and the "down bow" symbol looks like a clip or a square without the bottom side.
Up means starting from the top and pressing the bow, and down means starting from the frog (the place where the hand holds the bow) and pulling the bow.
The movement of the bow from bottom to top generates a more gentle sound, while bowing from top to bottom produces a stronger, more assertive sound.
Don't worry, draw your own marks, but remember that the printed marks on the bow are there for musical reasons, so usually you should stick to them.
The angry mob of market women forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and Elizabeth, the king's sister, to return from Versailles to Paris.
When the king and queen were returning to Paris in their carriage, they were accompanied by a screaming crowd shouting threats at them.
The angry crowd forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one moment, a person from the crowd shook the head of the guard killed at Versailles just in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of the imperialist United States for the conquest of the Philippines were covered by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses and bond interest introduced on the stock exchange on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banks.
Of course, the great profits obtained from the extended exploitation of the Filipinos would be the primary gains of United States imperialism.
The context in which the Knights Templar order was created is important in understanding its nature.
These events belong to the period commonly known as the late Middle Ages, which encompassed the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries in the history of Europe (1000–1300 AD).
Before the period of the High Middle Ages, there was the Early Middle Ages, and after it, the Late Middle Ages, which ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism encompasses a wide range of ideas applied in practice, including technological impetus or technological imperative, as well as a strict determination of human destiny driven by a hidden logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in the field of technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism combine two general principles: firstly, the process of technological development is not influenced by cultural or political factors, and secondly, technology generates effects within societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
One could say, for example, that motor vehicles necessarily lead to the development of road networks.
Since the nationwide road network is not economically viable when the number of vehicles is negligible, new methods of production are being developed to reduce vehicle operating costs.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in the number of road accidents, and as a result - to the invention of new ways to repair damaged bodies in medicine.
Romanticism contained an essential element of cultural determinism, which can be found in the writings of authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to this geography developed, so in line with the society's place that they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is famous today as the modern fashion capital, so once Constantinople was recognized as the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
His fame as a place of luxury began around the year 400 A.D. and lasted until the year 1000 A.D.
His status declined in the 12th century mainly because returning crusaders brought such goods as silk and spices, which were more highly valued than what was offered at Byzantine markets.
It was then that the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the dress was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because the exchange of information was slow, Western styles could develop with a delay of 25-30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to shape its own style. One of the greatest achievements of this time, as a consequence of the Crusades, was the use of buttons for fastening clothing.
Agriculture for own needs means that the farmer produces enough food to meet the needs of himself and his family.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses self-supplied seeds from the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods of maximizing productivity.
Formerly, the majority of farmers only satisfied their own needs and this is still the case in many developing countries today.
Subcultures attract people with a similar attitude towards the world, people who feel that social norms do not meet their needs, people who find a sense of identity within the subculture.
Subcultures vary in terms of age, ethnic origin, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The distinguishing features of a subculture in its distinctness can be of a linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic nature, or may constitute a combination of different factors.
If someone is a member of a subculture, they show it through a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most popular ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults during their upbringing - whether due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional exploitation.
Such children are referred to as "wild" or "feral". Some of them were imprisoned (usually by their parents), and some were abandoned because their parents were unable to cope with the serious mental or physical disability of their child.
Before being abandoned or running away, feral children may suffer from trauma or abuse.
It is suspected that some had raised the animals, and some reportedly live in the wild independently.
If a feral child is only cared for by animals, it behaves almost entirely (taking into account physical limitations) like those animals, showing fear or indifference towards humans.
The project method should facilitate and make learning more attractive, while learning by scaffolding goes one step further.
The scaffolding method is not a way of learning, but rather a support provided to individuals who are participating in new educational experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real, i.e. the teacher is a kind of scaffolding, just like Mr. Spinacz in the MS Office package.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software and is meant to question, suggest, and explain procedures, the independent understanding of which by the student may be challenging.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, such as neglect, abuse, and even coercion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that does not provide them with parenting, care, and education, but unfortunately, it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and good medical care.
Foster family should meet all needs that were not met in the home from which they were taken.
The internet can be used for both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific properties of the Internet open new dimensions in terms of ways of usage and approach to gratification.
For example, "learning" and "interacting with others" are proposed as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "lasting relationships" were also identified by Eighemey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they examined the audience's reactions to websites.
Video recordings allowed for significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial muscle movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly reading their microexpressions.
In the article titled "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks proves that people who, due to brain damage, do not understand speech, are still able to correctly assess the sincerity of the speaker.
It even suggests that such skills of interpreting human behaviors may also be possessed by animals, for example, pet dogs.
From scientific research conducted throughout the twentieth century, it appears that there are two pools of genetic variability - one hidden and the other expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, while selection removes variation from the pool of expressed genes.
With each generation, there is mutual exchange of variability between two pools through segregation and recombination.
Plants growing on the savanna make it difficult for the chief mammals with a digestive system like humans to satisfy the body's need for amino acids.
What's more, failing to do so can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would be proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but for higher primates like us, they are difficult to digest without prior cooking.
The situation is different with animal food (ants, termites, eggs), which is easily digested and provides large amounts of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
Taking everything into account, it should not be surprising that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees are currently doing it on the savannah.
The interruption of sleep involves the deliberate awakening during normal sleep and falling asleep again after 10-60 minutes.
It is not difficult if you use a relatively quiet alarm clock that restores awareness, but does not fully wake up.
If it turns out that you are rearranging the clock during sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get up to turn it off.
Other methods based on biorhythm recommend consuming a large amount of fluids (especially water or diuretic tea) before falling asleep, in order to have to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace is inversely proportional to the inner and physical tension of a person.
The smaller the stress, the more positive the life force. Every person has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it also includes the path of Mahayana love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in its essence. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
Kundalini yoga causes kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) to awaken through practicing asanas, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
In the center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. Through visualization of various deities, energetic channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightenment consciousness is created.
During World War II, the USA and the USSR allied against a common enemy, which were Germany. However, when the war came to an end, a radical clash of systems, processes, and cultures caused a rift between these two countries.
Two years have passed since the end of the war, when former allies became enemies, giving rise to the Cold War.
It was to last for the next 40 years and include real battles fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and other places.
Until September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, the only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, quickly became outdated when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, thereby violating the provisions of the Treaty of Riga, the Polish-Soviet non-aggression pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Transporting goods by ships is definitely the most efficient way to transport large quantities of goods and people across oceans.
The task of the navy has always been to ensure the country's ability to transport people and goods, while at the same time preventing the enemy from moving their people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign during World War II was one of the most outstanding examples in recent history. In order to help the British, the Americans attempted to transport people and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using submarines, tried to block these shipments.
If the allies had not succeeded, the Germans would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
The domestication of goats probably occurred in the Iranian Zagros mountains around 10,000 years ago.
People belonging to ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them because of their milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds, which roamed the hills or other pastures, often supervised by goat herders, who were usually children or teenagers. These breeding methods are still used.
Railway tracks were already being built in England in the 16th century.
Despite the fact that the tracks were built only on parallel wooden planks, horse-drawn wagons could move faster on them and transport larger loads than on the rough roads of the time.
Railway sleepers on which the rails were secured appeared relatively early. However, it was gradually understood that in order to increase the efficiency of the tracks, iron strips should be installed on them.
This became a popular practice, but the iron contributed to greater wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In the end, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, iron rails were introduced, produced entirely from iron.
The first known way of mobility was walking; man began to walk in an upright position two million years ago, hence the term Homo Erectus (upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, were not in the habit of walking upright.
Forms of bipedalism can be found in the fossils of Australopithecus dating back to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is not excluded that Sahelanthropus was already walking on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the ecological movement, and we can even take on the role of activists to contribute to reducing the scale of suffering in the future to some extent.
This often resembles symptomatic treatment. However, in order not to limit ourselves to a temporary solution, it is necessary to identify the source of the problems and eliminate them.
It is obvious that the world has significantly changed due to scientific and technological progress, and due to overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle, problems have intensified.
When the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress on July 4th, its handwritten version signed by John Hancock, President of Congress, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The document was read publicly for the first time by John Nixon on the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who ordered it to be read to his troops on July 9 in New York. A copy reached London on August 10.
25 still existing bulwarks of the Dunlap family are the oldest copies of the document that have survived. The handwritten original did not survive.
Many paleontologists claim that one group of dinosaurs survived to this day. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are still many things in birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs, just like T-Rex.
Actually, all currently used computers rely on manipulating information encoded as a binary system.
The binary number can have a value of 0 or 1, and numbers of this kind are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not manifest immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are so general that they do not provide a basis for immediate diagnosis.
The presence of an open package of medicine or toxic household chemical is the best indicator of poisoning.
Familiarize yourself with the instructions on the label to learn how to administer first aid in case of this specific poisoning.
The name "worm" is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term dates back to ancient times, when bedbugs, highly adapted insects for parasitizing on humans, were not unfamiliar.
Both the booklice and the bed bugs are nest-dwellers, adapted to living in the nest or in the host's home.
In the United States, there have been around 400 thousand cases of multiple sclerosis registered, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
SM is a disease that attacks the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
According to the results of conducted research, the risk of multiple sclerosis is two times higher in women than in men.
The couple can decide that the upbringing of the child is not in their interest or in the interest of the child.
Those couples can make a decision about preparing an adoption plan for their child.
Adoption involves biological parents relinquishing their parental rights so that another couple can be the child's parents.
The main goal that science sets for itself is to discover the mechanism of the world's operation using the scientific method. Most scientific research is based on this method.
However, this is not the only method; an experiment is a test that allows to reject one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also give direction to scientific research.
Classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin translation, formed the basis of studies conducted by naturalists and philosophers.
Aristotle's views were adopted in all scientific matters, including psychology.
Since the knowledge of the Greek language was decreasing, the West became cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend fundamentally on the existence of endogenous cycles and their creation by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms not only as reactions to external periodic stimuli have been documented in relation to the majority of living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that persist through entire cycles, even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading evidence that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used the same bacteriophages or viruses to inject bacteria with their own DNA.
Two experiments were conducted, one labeling DNA in a phage with radioactive phosphorus, and the other labeling phage protein using radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects, depending on their type, the significance of the genetic material element involved, and whether the affected cells are embryonic stem cells.
Only mutations in germ line cells can be passed on to children; mutations in other locations may result in cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people interested in exploring natural areas, admiring landscapes, including vegetation and wildlife.
Sample activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and collecting information about the ecosystem.
An example can be visiting Borneo, taking photos, and gathering information about orangutans.
Every morning people leave their small towns by car and go to work, on the way they pass those who are going to the places they just left.
As part of this dynamic shuttle transport, everyone in some way participates in a transportation system based on private vehicles, and this system is supported.
Currently, science indicates that the enormous coal economy has caused the displacement of the biosphere from its stable state, which has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is a participant in social life and uses transportation. Almost everyone complains about transportation.
In developed countries, similar complaints about water quality or bridge collapses are rarely heard.
Why are there so many complaints about transportation systems, why are there irregularities in their functioning every day? Are the engineers responsible for them just simply incompetent? Or maybe the problem runs much deeper?
The traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
It is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with 100% certainty, so unfortunately studying traffic flow presents difficulties.
Fortunately, drivers' behavior fits within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows also show some consistency and can be approximately represented by mathematical calculations.
The relationships between the three key properties, namely (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed, allow for a better visualization of traffic flow.
Planning, designing, and operating road facilities utilize this type of relationships.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. The ability to fly allowed them to easily avoid enemies and more effectively find food and mates.
Most insects have the useful ability to fold their wings along the body.
Thanks to this, they have a greater choice of small hiding places from predators.
Today, the only insects that do not have the ability to fold their wings are dragonflies and caddisflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
There were those who believed he was right, while others held the opposite view, i.e. that the solar system, along with the Sun and other stars, revolves around the Earth.
It makes sense because Earth doesn't seem to be moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, and in some places its width reaches nearly 6 miles.
The Amazon is responsible for 20% of the waters from rivers that feed the oceans on Earth.
The Amazon River in its main course has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles) and is fed by thousands of small tributaries.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom period, the size and technical perfection of the pyramids in Giza were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians from the New Kingdom era looked with admiration at the structures of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world, and also the country with the smallest population.
In its legislation and official communications, the Vatican uses the Italian language.
The majority of people working in this country use Italian as their daily language, while Latin can often be heard during religious ceremonies.
All residents of the Vatican are of the Roman Catholic faith.
In ancient times, people were already familiar with basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, because they are present in nature in their natural form and can be relatively easily extracted using simple tools.
Philosopher Aristotle put forward the theory that everything is a combination of at least one to four elements. These were: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four states of matter (in this order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also speculated about their transformation into new substances that shape what we see.
Stop can be defined as a mixture of two or more metals. It is important to remember that the periodic table contains a large number of elements.
Calcium and potassium are elements considered to be metals. Of course, silver and gold are also classified as metals.
There may also be alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. Matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so unimaginably tiny that a dot at the end of this sentence would contain trillions of them.
So when the pencil appeared, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of newer writing methods, the pencil has lost its status and frequency of use.
People now write messages using computer screens and don't need pencils at all.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer appears.
The atomic bomb works according to the principle that energy is needed to connect the nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing a heavy cart uphill. The splitting of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei that decay with little or no provocation.
The surface of the Moon is covered with rocks and dust. The outer layer of the planet is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the plateaus.
On the visible side, there may be more maria areas, because the crust is thinner here and the lava found it easier to break through to the surface.
Theories of content focus on finding what resonates with and speaks to people.
These theories assume that people have specific needs and/or desires that have been internalized during the process of maturing into adulthood.
These theories refer to what makes some people want to do what they do and what in their environment causes them to do certain things, and others not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when leaders start leading their former colleagues, two types of behaviors can occur. One of them is an attempt to remain "one of the team" (or one).
This type of manager reluctantly makes unpopular decisions, avoids disciplinary actions and shies away from evaluating performance, assigning tasks and holding people accountable for their work.
The second extreme consists of unrecognizably transforming into someone who feels the need to change everything the band has done so far, and to subordinate it to their own vision.
At the end of the day, the leader is ultimately responsible for the successes and failures of the team.
Such behavior often results in friction between the leaders and the rest of the team members.
In the case of virtual teams, the same standards of excellence apply, but there are minor differences.
Members of the virtual team often function as the point of contact for the directly related physical group.
They often have more freedom than ordinary team members because their teams can organize meetings according to different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
"The invisible group" is the managing team to which all members are subordinate. The invisible group sets standards for each member.
For what reason would a company want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing the concept of a learning organization is innovation.
Creativity and resourcefulness flourish when all available resources are effectively utilized in the functional departments of the organization.
As a result, collaboration within the organization to overcome a barrier can lead to the creation of an innovative process that will satisfy customer needs.
In order for the organization to become innovative, its management must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and learning.
Angel (2006) explains Continuum approach as a method that helps organizations achieve higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive research. This narrows the scope of research and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports ongoing scientific research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in cognitive functions.
Thanks to new technologies, we can observe and study previously unknown brain structures and processes occurring within it.
We draw a lot of information and materials from here to build simulation models that allow us to better understand what is happening in the human mind.
Although artificial intelligence is strongly linked to science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research on artificial intelligence involves building machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligence.
Examples include: control and planning, the ability to respond to client statements and questions, as well as recognizing the character of writing, voice, and face.
These things have become separate fields, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is widely used today in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and military technology, and it also appears as an embedded element in several applications used in personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an essential part of every lesson. It often happens that the teacher would eagerly take her students to places where buses do not reach.
Technology provides the opportunity for virtual field trips. Students can see museum collections, visit aquariums, or admire works of art from the comfort of their own classroom.
By providing a virtual field trip, you can stimulate reflections on the topic and share experiences with subsequent classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; every year the site is changed, but old versions remain online as an album.
Blogs can help students make progress in writing. Often at the beginning of blogging, grammar and spelling are not at the highest level, but the presence of readers usually changes that.
The blogger begins to make efforts to improve the quality of his texts and avoid criticism, because students often give the harshest grades.
In addition, blogging "helps students better understand the world around them." The need to respond to the interests of the audience inspires students to offer intelligent and interesting content (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is an inspiring tool for collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Thanks to the proper use of blogs, "students can become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet posts, they can determine their position in relation to the work of others and outline their own perspective on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital of Canada, with many art galleries and museums showcasing the past and present of Canada.
To the south of here lies the Niagara Falls, and to the north you can discover the pristine beauty of the Muskoka district and the surrounding regions.
All these things - and more - clearly indicate that Ontario is considered by outsiders as the quintessence of Canada.
Vast areas further north are sparsely populated, some of them are practically deserted wilderness.
The comparison of populations surprises many people: the number of African Americans living in the United States exceeds the number of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean to the east of the coast of Africa.
Madagascar is without a doubt the largest, and due to its nature, it constitutes a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or aligned with France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, which definitely took hold in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European expansion and colonialism emerged in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
From the north, the region borders with the Sahel, and it is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean from the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that every woman traveling should pretend to be married regardless of her true marital status.
It also helps to put on a ring (as long as it doesn't look too expensive.
Women should know that cultural differences can result in behaviors that they perceive as harassment, such as being followed, held by the hands, etc.
Resolutely refuse men and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences do not mean it has to be this way!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and served as a strategic port called Anfa for the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru-I-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who had trading posts there named it Casablanca.
When it comes to shopping, Casablanca is at the bottom of the list in all of Morocco.
In the old Medina, it is easy to buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather products, water pipes, and all sorts of different trinkets, but this is an offer typically intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located at the eastern edge of the country near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed when the Nyiragongo volcano erupted and lava buried most of the city's streets, especially its center.
While Goma is quite safe, all visits outside of its area should be pre-assessed for the state of conflict in the North Kivu province.
From the city, you can go on a hike to the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as track mountain gorillas, which is one of the cheapest options for this attraction in Africa.
One can use motorcycle taxis (known as boda-boda) to get around Goma. The standard (local) price for a short ride is around 500 Congolese francs.
In the context of its relatively difficult accessible location, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Currently Timbuktu is a poor city, yet its reputation attracts tourists, and there is an airport there.
In 1990, the city was placed on the list of endangered sites of world heritage due to damage caused by desert sands.
It was one of the main stops in Henry Louis Gates' special program on PBS "Wonders of the African World".
This city definitely differs from the rest of the cities in the country, as it has more of an Arabic than African climate.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forming the southern boundary.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each characterized by unique flora and fauna.
It is one of the biggest attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship among the national parks of South Africa (SANParks).
There are daily conservation and park entrance fees in place here, similar to all other South African national parks.
Purchase of a wild card may be beneficial as it allows access to selected parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the island of Hong Kong, which is the main attraction for many tourists.
The compact rows of buildings forming the skyline of Hong Kong have been compared to a shining bar chart accentuated by the waters of Victoria Harbor.
The best views of Hong Kong are offered by the Kowloon waterfront opposite the city.
The vast majority of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed lands along the northern shore.
This is a place occupied by British colonizers, so it's worth starting the search for traces of the colonial past of this territory here.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest belt of mangrove forests, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Part of the forest located in India is called the Sundarban National Park.
However, forests are not only mangrove swamps - they are also the last remnants of the huge jungles that once covered the Hindustani Plain.
The Sundarbans have an area of 3850 square kilometers, of which approximately one-third is covered by water and marshes.
Since 1966, Sundarban has been a wildlife reserve and it is estimated that there are 400 Royal Bengal tigers and roughly 30,000 spotted deer living there now.
Buses depart from the interregional bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most of them leave between 6:30 and 7:30, especially those heading east and to Jakar / Bumthang.
It's better to buy a ticket a few days in advance, because the buses running between districts are often crowded.
Most districts are served by small Japanese waterfront buses, comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient means of transportation to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge that allows communication between the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Two towers have a height of 83 meters, its length is 378 meters, and it has two lanes of traffic with a width of 3.5 meters.
The vertical clearance of the bridge is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened for use until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be available for use in September 2017, when the completion of the construction of the Brazilian customs posts is expected.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in the region of present-day eastern Paraguay, leading a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle and practicing agriculture to meet their own needs.
The Chaco region was the homeland of other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived thanks to hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "great province of India", arose in the 16th century as a result of the clash between Spanish conquistadors and native inhabitants.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its native character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and the world's best players.
In December, the biggest polo tournament of the year takes place in Las Cañitas.
In other months, you can also come across tournaments and competitions organized on a smaller scale.
The Associacion Argentina de Polo offers more information about the polo matches and tickets.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
In general, payments in British pounds are accepted throughout the islands, credit cards can be used in Stanley, and often it is also possible to pay in US dollars.
You should not rely on paying by card when visiting the most remote islands, even though British and American currency may be accepted; it's best to ask the owners in advance about the form of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so money should be exchanged before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer prevails there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, which means that temperatures often exceed +30°C in the summer months.
Winter can be colder than it seems: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but combined with wind and humidity, the feeling of cold is greater than the thermometer shows.
There are no "dry" and "rainy" seasons, the amount of precipitation is basically the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park have become accustomed to the sight of humans, they are still wild, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
Although they may seem gentle, bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year dozens of visitors sustain injuries because they do not maintain a proper distance. These are large, wild, and potentially dangerous animals that need space.
On top of that, be aware that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and inhabited by just under 40 thousand people.
In the 1850s, the city of Apia was founded, which became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
It was here that the infamous maritime impasse occurred in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships sank, except for one British cruiser. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the fight for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city ended in the killing of the main leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland stretches between two bays, so there are plenty of beaches here, and the most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the northern shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy, with safe swimming areas, and most of them are shaded by metrosideros trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Bay, in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in downtown Auckland.
They are often crowded, family beaches with a wide selection of shops filling the waterfront. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", which is not a complicated beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is "Manta".
It's worth stocking up on various French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink tap water here without any worries, but if anyone has doubts, they can easily find bottled water.
Australians are unfamiliar with the concept of "flat white" coffee. "Espresso" is a small black coffee, "cappuccino" is filled to the brim with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is in line with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are quite expensive, but they are excellent.
Many reef trips take place year-round, and injuries caused by any of these reasons are rare.
However, accept the advice of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cusk eels occur near beaches and river mouths from October to April, north of 1770. Sometimes they can also be found outside of this period.
No one denies the existence of sharks, but their attacks on humans are rare. Most of these creatures feel fear when encountering a human and swim away.
Rosary crocodiles do not lead an active life in the oceans; their primary living environment is the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance allows the traveler not to worry about whether they will have a place to stay upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies usually cooperate with specific hotels, although there is a possibility to book a different form of accommodation with a travel agent, for example, a campsite.
In the offers of travel agencies, we can find packages that include breakfasts, airport transfers, and combined packages for flights and hotels.
The reservation can be extended for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other necessary documents at the destination (eg. visas).
Any corrections or requests should first go to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of music festivals, the vast majority of participants choose to camp on site, most of them believe it to be an integral part of the experience.
If you would like to be close to the action, you have to come early to find a camping spot near the music.
It should be remembered that even when the music performances on the main stages are over, in some festival sectors the music will continue to play until late at night.
Some festivals offer camping spots designed for families with small children.
When crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the journey through the ice generates a terrible noise for those most affected.
Sightseeing tours in St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise ship passengers are not required to have visas (conditions apply).
Casinos usually aim for their guests to stay as long as possible and leave as much money as possible. Hence the lack of windows and clocks, and the exit is hard to find.
They usually have special offers including meals, drinks, and entertainment to ensure good mood of the guests and keep them with them.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages at the company's expense, but intoxication impairs judgment and all seasoned gamblers know the value of a sober mind.
When driving a vehicle at high latitudes or through mountain passes, one should consider conditions such as snow, ice, and temperatures below zero.
On roads covered with ice and snow, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as on clean pavement.
When a snowstorm rages, so much snow can quickly fall that the road becomes impassable.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by drops or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, where traffic flows without major obstacles all year round.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important event for many visitors.
The popular use of the term safari refers to land travels undertaken to admire the stunning African nature, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach close to cars, and standard equipment will allow for proper viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be skittish, so it's better to observe them through binoculars.
The pedestrian safari ("bush walk") can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will begin on August 24 and last until September 5, 2012. Some events will be hosted in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to host the Summer Olympics twice (the first time was in 1964).
If you booked a flight and accommodation for 2020 before the change of date was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
The rules for cancellations are different, but by the end of March, most cancellations caused by the coronavirus do not include July 2020, when the Olympic Games were supposed to take place.
According to expectations, the prices of most event tickets will range from 2500 yen to 130,000 yen, while the typical ticket price will be around 7000 yen.
Ironing can speed up the drying of damp clothes. Many hotels rent irons and ironing boards if they are not provided in the room's amenities.
If you don't have an iron or don't care about wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if it is available.
The fabric should not be subjected to excessive heating, as it may shrink or burn in extreme cases.
Water can be purified in many ways, and some of them more effectively combat specific threats.
Depending on the area, water may need to be boiled for a minute or several minutes.
Filters have different levels of efficiency, so if you have concerns, consider purchasing bottled water from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers may come across animals belonging to pests that do not occur in their native areas.

Usually, infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people are not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping offers an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in specific locations.
Travelers visiting countries with particularly high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on items like alcohol and tobacco.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, the most difficult section for drivers lies between Point Marion and Fairmont, often cutting through remote forested areas.
If you're not accustomed to driving on rural roads, keep your eyes open because you will often encounter steep inclines, narrow stretches, and sharp turns.
Marked speed limits are significantly lower than those that apply on previous and subsequent sections (usually 35-40 mph, or 56-64 km/h), and strict compliance with them is of exceptional importance.
The curiosity, however, is that the cell network here has a much stronger signal than in many other parts of this route, for example, in the Pennsylvania Wilds region.
The German pastries are quite tasty, and the Bavarian ones stand out with their richness and variety, just like in Austria, which borders Bavaria to the south.
Very popular are fruit pastries: with cooked apples available throughout the year, and with cherries and plums in the summer.

Because there are as many as 17,000 islands, the term Indonesian cuisine covers a wide range of regional cuisines from across the country.
This term without additional specific definitions usually refers to the cuisine typical of the central and eastern regions of Java, which is the most important island in the region.
Javanese cuisine, now easily available throughout the archipelago, includes simply spiced dishes, and the favorite additions of Javanese people are peanuts, chili peppers, and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are the supports for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with greater stability but can cause safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown off the horse and their foot gets stuck in the stirrup, the fleeing horse can drag them. Various safety measures can be taken to minimize the risk of such an incident.
First of all, most jockeys wear horse riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English ones, are equipped with safety measures that cause stirrups to detach from the saddle if the rider falls backwards.
Cochamó Valley - the most important climbing location in Chile, referred to as the Yosemite of South America, offering a variety of large granite walls and spires.
From the peaks, spectacular views spread out. Climbers from all over the globe continue to set new routes among the walls offering countless possibilities.
Winter sports such as downhill skiing or snowboarding are popular sports that involve descending on snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is the main activity on trips for many enthusiasts, sometimes referred to as "skiing fanatics", who plan whole holidays on skis in a particular location.
Skiing has a very long history – as early as 5000 years BC, silhouettes of skiers were painted on cave walls!
Alpine skiing as a sport discipline dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski resort in Australia.
Cross-country skiing: this activity is also called ski touring or ski touring.
One can see some similarities to alpine skiing and climbing, but unlike them, the route does not run through steep terrain and sturdy skis and boots are not needed.
Think of the ski route as a similar route to a hiking route.
Under favorable conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than when hiking on foot, but only in rare cases will you achieve running speeds, and only if you are without a heavy backpack and the route is properly prepared.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. In normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean the need to apply for many visas and go through many passport controls.
From this point of view, the Schengen zone functions to some extent like one country.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly with a Schengen visa, there is no need to submit a separate visa application to each of the Schengen member countries, which allows to save time and money and reduce formalities.
There is no universal definition that specifies which human creations should be considered as antiques. Some tax agencies treat any items over 100 years old as antiques.
This definition depends on the geographical location, the age limit may be lower in North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be called antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Many Sami people make a living from reindeer herding, and the culture associated with this industry is also important for people in other professions.
The traditional occupation that the Sami have been and still are involved in is not only large-scale reindeer herding, but also fishing, hunting, etc., with reindeer mainly used as draft animals.
Today, many Saami people work in modern sectors. Tourism is an important branch of the economy in Lapland, which is inhabited by the Saami.
The word "Gypsy" is commonly heard, especially among people who are not Roma themselves, but it is often considered offensive because it evokes associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma.
If the country you are traveling to is subject to travel regulations, it will affect your health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.

When planning a trip to a country considered a war zone, it is necessary to undergo professional training.
Searching the internet for the phrase "Course on a hostile environment" will likely lead you to the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the issues discussed here, much more thoroughly and in combination with practice.
Usually the course lasts from 2 to 5 days, and it includes role-playing exercises, a lot of first aid classes, and sometimes also firearms training.
There are numerous books and magazines available on the topic of survival art, while there are very few publications on war zones.
Persons planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must have valid documents for the return journey.
Governments have different attitudes towards issuing passports without specifying gender (X) or updating names and genders in documents according to the wishes of the applicants.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents is equally diverse.
Furthermore, after September 11, 2001, security control guards began conducting much more rigorous searches.
Before the operation, transgender individuals should not expect that their privacy and dignity will not be violated during scans.
Strain currents are created by waves breaking on the beach, reef or similar barrier.
The underwater topology causes the return flow to occur mainly at several deeper levels and a fast current can form there directed towards the deep waters.
Most often, death occurs as a result of exhaustion caused by attempting to swim against the current, which is not always possible.
When you manage to get out of the current, swimming back should not be more difficult than usual.
Try to move to a place where you won't be caught in the current again, or wait for a rescue operation, taking into account your skills and whether someone has noticed you.
The reverse culture shock comes faster than the cultural shock (the "honeymoon period" is shorter), it lasts longer and can have more serious consequences.
Tourists who easily adapted to the new culture sometimes have exceptional difficulty readapting to their native culture.
Returning home after a period of living abroad, you have become accustomed to the new culture and have shed some of the habits associated with your national culture.
During your first trips abroad, people probably treated you with patience and understanding, knowing that a traveler arriving in a foreign country must adapt.
People often do not anticipate that travelers returning home must also show patience and understanding.
The light and sound show on the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions for kids from the area.
You can admire the pyramids after dark and in silence, before the show begins.
Usually, you can always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors here. The story told by sound and light is like a book of fairy tales.
Sphinx plays the role of the background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are the subject of claims by several countries and have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen were operational in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas, has the largest area of all.
Other ones are Livingstone Island and Deceptive Island, where a water-filled caldera of a still active volcano forms a picturesque natural bay.
The Ellsworth Land is located to the north of the Peninsula and is surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula join here in a plateau, after which they emerge again, forming the 360-kilometer long Ellsworth mountain chain, split by the Minnesota glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range there are the highest mountains of Antarctica, Vinson Massif, and the highest peak reaches a height of 4892 m.
In remote areas where there is no mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone generally cannot be a substitute for a cellular phone, because you have to go outside and have a clear view of the satellite to connect.
The service is often used in navigation, recreational boats, and during expeditions requiring remote data and voice services.
Your local telecommunications service provider should provide more information about this service.
Among the people planning a gap year, travel and learning options are becoming increasingly popular.
This is a popular solution among school graduates, which gives them the opportunity for a gap year before starting their studies, without any harm to their education.
Frequently participating in a year-long course abroad can significantly improve the chances of obtaining higher education in one's home country.
The most common practice is to charge a fee for enrolling in these educational programs.
Finland offers perfect conditions for relaxing on a boat. This "land of a thousand lakes" also abounds in islands, of which there are thousands on the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
On archipelagos and lakes, a yacht is not necessarily required.
Although coastal archipelagos and the most extensive lakes are sufficiently large for all yachts, smaller sailboats or even kayaks provide different experiences.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland; one boat is owned by seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand have similar statistical indicators, but it is still an exceptional result compared to countries like the Netherlands, where one boat accounts for forty citizens.
Extended stay in St. Petersburg is included in the itinerary of most Baltic cruise tours.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days and return to the ship at night.
If you only go ashore during a boat tour, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin in their tour program. The above map clearly shows that Berlin is not located by the sea or in its vicinity, so a visit to this city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages, especially if they have not flown before or have a traumatic experience behind them.

Some are able to overcome the fear of the unknown or lack of control if they learn the principles of airplane operation and flying mechanisms.
Courier companies make good money on fast deliveries. Time often plays a crucial role when it comes to business documentation or urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but it was problematic in relation to other routes and smaller companies.
If they were sending packages by air transport, unloading and customs clearance on some routes could take many days.
The only way to send it faster is to check it in as registered baggage. According to the airline regulations, baggage cannot be sent without a passenger, and that's your task.
The most obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to shell out a substantial amount of money for this privilege (or - even better - to have a company do it for you).
This is, however, a costly option: generally, for a business class ticket we will pay four times more than for a standard economy class, and for first class as much as eleven times more!
Basically, it's not worth spending time looking for discounts for business class or first class seats, when it comes to direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of travelers who are willing to pay any amount to get to their destination quickly and comfortably, and they take this into account when setting prices.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova, where the local language is Romanian, although Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic experiencing conflicts on an ethnic background.

Despite unsuccessful political negotiations, economic ties were restored between the two parts of Moldova.
Orthodoxy is the dominant religion in Moldova.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million, it is also the second largest port, right after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.

The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the residents prefer to speak in Catalan, the majority of them understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs only have a Catalan version because it is the first official language according to the law.

We will find rare animal species there, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, pine marten and capercaillie, along with many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must have their knees and shoulders covered.
In most monasteries, inappropriately dressed women are given a headscarf, but it is worth having your own, especially a brightly colored one, to see a smile on the face of a monk or nun at the entrance to the temple.
Men are also expected to wear pants that cover the knees.
Men can also borrow knee-covering scarves at the entrance, but they are not regularly washed, so not everyone will feel comfortable wearing such a scarf. One size fits all for men!
The basis of the cuisine in Majorca, as in other similar areas of the Mediterranean Sea, is bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) as well as olive oil.

All nouns are written with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence, including the word "Sie", which is a polite form meaning "you".
This is an important method that allows to distinguish some sentences from complements.
It can be argued that this also makes reading easier, although difficulties arise when writing, as it is necessary to determine whether the verb or adjective is used in noun form.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple - most words are pronounced as they are written.

Observatories from pre-modern times are already outdated today and are being turned into museums or educational centers.
Because light pollution during their prime wasn't as much of a problem as it is now, they are usually located in cities or campuses, more accessible than those being built today.
Most modern research telescopes are massive devices located in remote places where favorable atmospheric conditions prevail.
The tradition of contemplating cherry blossoms, called hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea originated from China, where plum flowers were most popular.
In Japan, the emperor organized the first cherry blossom receptions exclusively for himself and other aristocrats from the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to pick "just one" specimen.

Christmas, commemorating the birth of Jesus in the world, is one of the most important Christian holidays.
Also non-believers in Christian countries and people of other religions around the world have incorporated many traditions associated with these holidays into their lives.
According to a certain tradition, Easter night is spent by staying awake in an open place and waiting for the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations of this tradition, but it may as well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
Churches with a more traditional approach conduct the liturgy of the Easter Vigil on the evening of Holy Saturday, and the faithful often begin celebrating the resurrection of Christ when the clock strikes midnight.
All animals, which found themselves on the island first, arrived here by swimming, flying or sailing.
The distance from the continent was so great that mammals were unable to reach there, which made the giant tortoise the primary species living in the Galapagos.
When people arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals appeared there, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you go to the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, you will experience polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark almost all day.

The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal in nature than the work culture to which people in the West are accustomed.
A suit is the standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last name or use their official title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial and emphasizes collective effort, rather than individual achievements.
Employees usually have to obtain permission from their superiors in order to make decisions on their own, and they also have to follow orders without any questions.
