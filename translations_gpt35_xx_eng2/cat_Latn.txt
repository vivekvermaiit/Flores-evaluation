This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely accepted, but also provides details that fossils usually cannot offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists say that the fur of this animal was brown on the top with a light color or carotenoid background.
The finding also offers a glimpse into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but do have other feather characteristics - barbs and barbules - researchers deduce that the rachis was probably a more recent evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but for controlling temperature or for display. Researchers have suggested that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the plumage of an adult and not a chick.
The researchers suggest that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample reveals adult plumage, not just down.

The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the earth, causing the tides, the Milky Way exerts an attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory states that the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is located in a sort of halo around the galaxy, and is made up of many tiny particles.

In France, elections have traditionally been a not very technological experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed paper with the chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting sheet.

Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under heavy supervision, following specific procedures.

Uka's gun failed while aiming at the fifth man's head. Schneider constantly suffers, has blindness in one eye, a part of the skull missing, and a reconstructed titanium face.
Schneider declared via video conference from an air force base in the United States to his country.
Beyond the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo competed in 2 individual races at the Championship.
The first was the slalom, in which he got a "Did not finish" in the first round. Thirty-six of the remaining 116 competitors ended up with the same result.
In the other race she participated in, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth position among the seated women's group, with a combined time of all the laps of 4:41.30; 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first finisher, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth place finisher, Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four female skiers from the seated group did not finish their races, and 45 out of the total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not manage to qualify in the race.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone were recovered thanks to the work of the Madhya Pradesh police.
The Deputy Inspector General D K Arya has said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered her mobile phone and computer".
The accused are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki has said that the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Even though there were three people inside the house when the car crash occurred, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was reallocated to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at the Sheriff Court in Scotland charged with the murder of her son.
He is under custody pending accusation and trial, but any visual evidence could be rejected because his image has been published everywhere.
This is a common practice in any other part of the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
The professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee points out that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of the suspects."
The Crown's office, in charge of the accusations, has indicated to the journalists that it will not make any further statements, at least, until the sentence.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to establish according to the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East war.
Among the other matters discussed, as it appears, there is the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the dispute over the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands an uninterrupted military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA only commits to accepting it for five years.
The hunters in the supplementary pest control pilot test had to be closely supervised by the forest rangers, as the pilot test was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Volunteers were recruited under the hunting program of the Association of Sport Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Interim Director of the Conservation and Heritage Park with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received proper safety training and preparation.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
It is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council, as part of a package of measures aimed at moving the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the lack of holding elections, some of them scheduled for 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of malfunction and overheating of iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has declared that they had been informed of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported 34 other incidents related to overheating, which the company labeled as "non-serious".
In response, the ministry deemed Apple's postponement of the report "frankly unfortunate".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands has said that no damages have been reported in the nation.
Likewise, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center indicated that there had been no tsunami warning issued.
An ex-Filipino police officer has held Hong Kong tourists hostage to hijack their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Not long ago, six hostages were released, including the children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an older lady who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot and killed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins started to research premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, fetal lung maturation of the baby would be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight data recorders 'black boxes' on Wednesday.
Fighter companions have also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels has commented that "Luna was as freaky as me...maybe even more...I love her and will find her at the altar...I hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, those opposing Australia becoming a republic grew by 8% since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the campaign for the 2010 federal elections that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The winner of the gold medal at the Olympic Games had to swim in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been cast in doubt due to his complaints.
He has not been able to take the necessary medication to manage his pain because they are prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number discovered as of January 25th.
Many people verified the discovery using different machinery and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water sent to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, ever since some comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term earlier this year and signed a law last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense".
It is speculated that he will run for the presidential elections in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel every year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the old technology based on ground radars so that air traffic controllers can locate pilots much more accurately and send them more accurate information.
The reinforcement of transport and surface trains will not stop at Wembley; there are also no car parks or link parking on the street.
The concern about a lack of transportation has led to considering the possibility that the game may have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science described the formation of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species has evolved in just two generations, despite the belief that this process would take much longer, due to the crossing between a Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis (endemic), and a conical-billed Galápagos finch, Geospiza conirostris (foreign).
Gold can be worked in all kinds of ways. It can be molded into very small figures.
It can be inserted into thin threads, which can be twisted. It can be hammered or flattened into sheets.
It can be made very thin and stacked on top of other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images of books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of red cabbage juice changes depending on whether the substance is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the substance being analyzed.
The hydrogen ions are protons from which the electrons have been removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean damp hands, form it into a ball.
The humidity of the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a kind of barrier.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been discovered in the minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women gathered together.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and our vision.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to place a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The most outstanding thing that the wheel has done for us has been to make transportation much faster and simpler.
The train has taken us, the car and many other means of transportation.
Underneath them there are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including feral domestic cats) that eat the small prey that are far more abundant, such as small insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of its success is the concept of niche, a special job that every cat has and that prevents competing with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males related together with up to thirty females and pups.
The females are usually intimately related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The prides of lions behave to a large extent like packs of dogs or packs of wolves, which are animals with surprisingly similar behavior to lions (although not to other large felids) and equally deadly to their prey.
The tiger, a complete athlete, can climb (although not very well), swim, jump long distances, and push with 5 times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (panthera genus) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of the lion, but rather similar to an angry outburst of spoken words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than them.
The scientists believe that ocelots follow and find the animals they eat (prey) using their sense of smell, sniffing out the traces they leave on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they can also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with the environment and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main and original group (for example, by crossing a mountain range or a river, or by migrating to a new island and not being able to return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they had before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it needed before to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations were so different that they could no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is a consequence that cannot be avoided and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and take the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, that we exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and we make clothes with plants. Most of what we eat are plants. Without plants, most animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, which is why it feared nothing, except for other mosasaurs.
His long mandibles had over seventy teeth sharpened like knives, accompanied by an additional set in the roof of the mouth, so there was no escape route for anything that stood in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a bifurcated tongue. Its diet included turtles, long fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that went into the water; not even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex could rival him.
Although most of their foods would be familiar to us, the Romans had a few rare or unusual products at their banquets; such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and some rodents called dormice.
Another difference was that, while the poor people and women ate sitting in a chair, rich men liked to participate in banquets where they gorge together while eating.
The ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tried a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then a closed sanctuary to which only the priests could access.
Sometimes special pyramids in the shape of towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, housing was not as important.
The majority of Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were simple open counters that looked out onto the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland after a murder and, while traveling west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
However, despite its discovery, there were already Inuit tribes living there at that time.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, maybe you imagine that behind the Declaration of Independence there is a treasure map written.
Now, this is not true. Although there is something written behind the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text is located at the bottom of the document, facing downwards.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that in the early stages of its creation the long scroll (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Thus, it seems that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by "Vichy" France. These were French people who had signed a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of opposing them.
The allies invaded the south of France on August 15, 1940, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were advancing towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, with the meaning of city or city-state, and this also defines in some way the dimensions of society.
The city-states preceded the nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge through many generations, a persistent cultural footprint, and equitable dissemination.
The minority cultures often disappear without leaving clear historical traces and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central governmentwith the Congress being its only componentunder the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and since there were no national executive or judicial authorities, it fell upon the state authorities, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
I also did not have the authority to invalidate tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles needed the unanimous approval of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives often were absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the champions of the FIFA World Cup 2006.
The most well-known sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 racing.
The most popular sports in the northern regions are winter sports, and they involve the participation of Italians in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making it the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, we often call it, in geographic terms, an "archipelago"
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by coined the name "Ilha Formosa" or beautiful island for the island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeast Taiwan, where they began transforming the practices of indigenous grain production and hired Chinese workers for rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which would rule the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most common frame format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main film size at the end of the era of analog films.
The aspect ratio is still produced today, but more importantly: its aspect ratio has been inherited in the formats of digital image camera sensors.
The 35 mm format actually creates some confusion, with 36 mm of width and 24 mm of height.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the family of APS formats, for example) are the same or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been overused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
He says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection between the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period, European history questioned the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the monetary funds of the church exist precisely for this reason.
The main authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many people to wonder if this dogma was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the beginning of the hostilities, Brittany began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, cutting off vital supplies to both military and civilians, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international laws that had been codified by various international agreements in the last two centuries.
Brittany mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering complete segments of the ocean, even putting neutral ships at risk.
Since there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among the majority of citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolation.
After having seen the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations were eager to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred dollars to his name, a book of poetry, and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
The Ancient China had a unique way of showing different historical epochs: each stage of China or each family in power was a different dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most well-known of these periods was the era of the 3 Kingdoms, which took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars took place between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most bloodiest periods in ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Similarly after the Revolution, occupations were opened to all men who applied, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve it.
This also applies to the military because instead of basing the army's ranks on classes, from that moment on they were based on relevance.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mahoma was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that would become known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, gives a quite clear image of the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
At the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, and even knowing of its existence, it is not easy to find at all. The isolation is absolute once you arrive inside the cave.
You can see nothing but a clear and beautiful sky above your head, and the abundant mountains that surround it. There is very little of this world that can be seen or felt from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands.
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many great pyramid structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings contains several pyramids (among which, the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected in honor of the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The "upward arc" signal resembles the letter V (lowercase ve) and the "downward arc" appears like a staple or a square without the bottom side.
When it appears upwards it means you have to start from the tip and push the bow in an upward direction, and when it is pointing downwards it means you have to start from the heel (which is where the hand holds the bow) and stretch the bow in a downward direction.
Rubbing the strings from right to left produces a softer sound, while doing it the other way around produces a louder and more assertive sound.
Take the liberty to write down your own indications, but keep in mind that the musical markings are there for a reason, so they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Maria Teresa and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a crowd of female merchants to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and making threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to have the carriage windows completely open.
At a certain point, a member of the crowd displayed the head of a murdered royal guard at Versailles in front of the horrified Queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime, in order to finance a large part of the expenses and interests of the bonds floated on behalf of the Filipino government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Of course, the huge profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is popularly known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is guided by a hidden logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, at the same time, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that motor cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a road network throughout the country for a handful of cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of having a car.
The possession of cars in mass also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had an important component of cultural determinism, shaped by writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time customs and cultures related to that geography emerged that were better than arbitrarily imposed laws, as they were in harmony with the place and with society.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital in the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around the year 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
His status diminished during the twelfth century mainly because the Croats had returned carrying gifts such as silk and spices, which had more value than those offered in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this moment that the title of fashion capital went from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak popularity during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, and in the 14th century.
Initially, the attire was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slowness of communication channels, styles could reach the west with a delay of 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of the time is that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is carried out to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses native seeds saved from the eco-region combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, the majority of farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and it is still the case in many developing nations.
The subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel abandoned by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
The members of a subculture often distinguish themselves from other subcultures by the distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which includes fashion, customs, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to resort to the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults while growing up, due to negligence, misfortune, or intentional abuse.
These children are called "wild" or feral. Some wild children have been isolated by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this child abandonment was due to the rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability by the parents.
The wild children may have suffered childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Other supposedly have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild all alone.
The wild child, when raised only by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (always within physical limits) almost identical to those of the animal that raises it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, building goes one step further.
The theory of scaffolding is not a learning method, but a support that provides support to individuals undergoing a new training experience, such as learning to use a new computer program or starting a project.
The bastides can be virtual or real: in other words, a professor is a form of bastida, but so is the little assistant clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual tutorials are internalized in the software and are designed to question, demonstrate and explain procedures that may have been too complicated for the student to figure out on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for different reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, and including extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where they are not nourished, loved and educated, but there are some who do.
We believe that the foster care system is a form of security for these children.
Our reception system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The welcome is supposed to provide all the needs that were not covered in the original home.
Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important reasons for the use of the internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivating factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated the public's reaction to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The King's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are still capable of accurately assessing sincerity.
Even suggests that these abilities to interpret human behavior could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and exposed.
The mutation adds new genetic variation, and the selection eliminates it from the pool of expressed variation in the genome.
The segregation and recombination combine forward and backward variation between the two genetic heritages in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet their amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
In addition, failing to achieve it has serious consequences: decline in growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant resources to obtain would have been the proteins provided by leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, these are difficult to digest for primates such as us, humans.
On the other hand, animal origin foods (ants, termites, eggs) not only digest easily, but also provide a large amount of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
However, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that the savanna chimpanzees do today.
The interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally waking up during the normal sleep period and falling back asleep after a while (10 - 60 minutes).
This is easy to do using a quiet alarm clock that wakes you up gently without fully waking you up.
If you are one of those who reset the clock while sleeping, try putting it at the other end of the room, so you have to get up to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before going to bed, so that one is forced to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person possesses is inversely correlated to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present life force. Each person has the potential to find peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that gets in the way of this path is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it spread through the path of the Mahayana's love and through many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, kundalini energy (illustrated energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was the common enemy in the Second World War, which facilitated collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the armistice came the clash of systems, processes, and cultures, and both countries became enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the cold war began.
It lasted for the next forty years and there was a real fight, with delegated armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had already been penetrated and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and established fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral, or multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is, by far, the most efficient method of moving large quantities of people and merchandise across the oceans.
The work of the marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with the ability of your enemy to move their people and their goods.
One of the most relevant recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
Contemporarily, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the allies had failed, Germany could have likely conquered Great Britain, just as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountain range in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes started to domesticate them in order to easily have milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats used to be kept in herds that grazed on hills or other grazing areas, often watched over by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today.
The wagons were built in England already in the 16th century.
Although the tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they were pulled by wagons with horses to achieve higher speeds and to pull larger loads in the most difficult parts.
The sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was soon seen that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron cover on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron wore out the wooden wheels of the train cars more.
In the end, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first completely iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known means of transport was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
His ancestors, the australopithecus, didn't walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs at most around 7 million years ago.
We can start living in a more respectful way towards the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce the potential suffering in the future.
This only works as symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and that the problems have grown due to the excess of population and the extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thompson, to the printing press of John Dunlap located a few streets away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which today are known as "Dunlap flyers".
The first public reading of the document was carried out by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of this document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists nowadays believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and that they are still alive. We call them birds.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many traits of birds that resemble those of a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a tyrannosaurus would.
Practically all the computers we use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two possible values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits or bits, according to computer slang.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are quite common, so an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medication container or toxic household chemicals.
Look for instructions on specific first aid for the specific poison on the label.
The term "insecte" is used by entomologists in a formal way for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient relationship with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both reduviid bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
The EM is a disease that affects the central nervous system, formed by the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research has concluded that women have double (2 times more) the likelihood of suffering from multiple sclerosis than men.
A couple can decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main objective of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
Now, experimentation is not the only thing, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses; the formulation of questions and observations also guide scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinions on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
Just as Greek knowledge declined, the East found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented in the vast majority of living beings, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that follow a period of inertia even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments labeling the virus DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the virus protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ line cells.
Only mutations in the germ line cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations in any other location can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Among the examples of on-site activities are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of the small rural villages to go to their workplace and pass by others whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic vehicle everyone, in some way, is connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science is showing us today that this colossal coal economy has disrupted one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear so many complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems generate this kind of complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
The Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions established between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of the driver cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a considerably constant range; therefore, traffic flow tends to have considerable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between its three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operations of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape from enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings around their bodies.
This provides them with a great variety of tiny places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the stoneflies and the mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarcus claimed that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
There were people who thought what they said was true, but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System was moving towards Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because we don't have the sensation that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles in width.
20 per cent of the water that comes out of the planet's rivers towards the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical excellence of the construction of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
In the ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were fascinated by the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the daily language used by the majority of people living in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Knowledge of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper has been around since ancient times, as all of them can be found in nature in native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It resembled more the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although additionally, according to his theory, they would change to become new substances that form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table has many elements.
The elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. It is clear that there are also other metals like silver and gold.
One can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
All the Universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of small particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of atoms would fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
In this way, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the appearance of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and use.
Currently, people write messages on computer screens without ever needing a typewriter to sharpen.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will turn into when something newer arises.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to join a core with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart uphill. Separating the nucleus again releases part of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with a small or no collision.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust measures 70 km thick at the nearest part and 100 km at the farthest part.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
There may be more lunar seas on the visible face because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to come to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what people like or are interested in.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors can appear when administrators begin to lead their former colleagues. One extreme of the spectrum is to try to continue as "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of supervisor struggles to make unpopular decisions, apply disciplinary actions, carry out evaluations, assign responsibilities, and hold others accountable for their actions.
On the contrary, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that they need to change everything that the team has been doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often ends in arguments between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but with some minor differences.
The members of a virtual group usually serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They usually have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as their teams can meet at different time zones that local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the administrative team that each member addresses. The invisible team establishes standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? One of the purposes for implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can flourish when all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization.
As a result, the joint work of an organization to overcome adversity can lead to an innovative process to meet the customer's need.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains continuous improvement as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data provided physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, it narrows down the research area and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior supports the scientists' research.
It is known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, injuries and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before seen.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions as well as recognition of writing, voice, and face.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of economy, medicine, engineering, and military, as it has been built into various domestic computer applications and video games.
Thematic outings are an important part of any class. Very often, a teacher would love to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or contemplate the beauty of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual trip is also an excellent way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future students.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, every year the site is updated, but old versions are kept online as a memory book.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with neglected grammar and spelling, this usually changes with the presence of an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts making an effort to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogs "force students to be more clever with the world around them". The need to fuel the audience's interest inspires students to be clever and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and motivates students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can help students be more analytical and critical; they can define their positions in the context of others' writing and also highlight their own perspectives on specific topics by actively responding to internet materials (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and has a series of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south there are the Niagara Falls and to the north it hosts the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
These are all these elements, among others, that make Ontario stand out in the eyes of outsiders as a quintessential Canadian city.
The population of the large expanses of the north is rather scarce, and some areas are almost uninhabited wild lands.
For a comparison of populations that is usually surprising: there are more African Americans living in the USA than Canadian citizens.
The Islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and almost a continent in itself in terms of wildlife.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it took a great path to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advisable for any female traveler to say that she is married, regardless of her true marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (one that doesn't look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and it's not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Reject men firmly, and do not be afraid to defend your position (with or without cultural differences, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Amazigh fishermen in the 10th century BC, and Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids used it as a strategic port, which was then called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city with the name of Daru l-Badya, the name Casablanca comes from the Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in Morocco.
In the surroundings of the old Medina we can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of souvenirs, but it is all intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, towards the eastern end, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is considerably safe, it would be advisable to investigate before making any visit outside of this city to assess the status of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the more economical mountain gorilla treks in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The normal price (local) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctu" has ended up being used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in peril due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during the special program "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates for PBS.
The city is in stark contrast with the rest of the cities in the country because it has a more Arab air than African.
The Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa and spans the border of Mozambique to the east, and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River marking the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecosystems, each supporting diverse wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the benchmark of South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, a daily conservation fee and entrance fee must be paid.
It can also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry either to a selection of parks in South Africa, or to all the National Parks of South Africa.
The Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider the main center.
The group of buildings that make up the urban silhouette of Hong Kong has been associated with a shining bar graph that becomes evident with the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the other side of the Kowloon waterfront promenade.
The majority of urban development on the island of Hong Kong is densely populated on land reclaimed from the sea along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers occupied, so it is a good spot to start if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) into Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only swamps of mangroves - but also include some of the last remaining stops of the powerful jungles that had once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about a third is covered by water/swampy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axis deer in the area.
The buses leave from the intercity bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Panakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River bridge is a suspension bridge. It extends along the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters, a length of 378 meters, and has two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
The open vertical space under the bridge is 15 meters. Although the construction was completed in August 2011, it was not possible to transit there until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully functional in September 2017, when the customs of Brazil are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group that inhabited what is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies", was created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish initiated the period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important annual tournament of this sport takes place in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Here you can also see smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments or where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), with a value set equivalent to that of a British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West store.
Generally, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
In the peripheral islands, credit cards probably won't be accepted, although they may accept British and American currency; check with the owners in advance to determine which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange currency from the Falkland Islands outside of the islands, so you need to do it before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone. In the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be falsely cold: temperatures rarely reach levels below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make the sensation feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is more or less constant throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wild fauna and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from other wild animals!
Despite their apparent docility, bison, moose, ants, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not having left a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, take into account that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking odorous food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a famous insubordination in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave it.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. In addition, almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the death of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
The beaches are plentiful, since Auckland is situated between two ports. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the district of North Harbour) face the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The majority of them are sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most have shade thanks to the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes family-friendly beaches full of a good range of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The most well-known local beer is the "Number One"; it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
Many French wines can be enjoyed there, but wines from New Zealand and Australia don't tolerate travel well.
It is completely safe to drink water from the local tap, but if you are worried, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of a "tallat" is foreign. A "tallat" is a short coffee, like an espresso, a cappuccino comes loaded with whipped cream (without foam), and tea is served without milk.
The melted chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but the quality is excellent.
Throughout the year, many trips are made to the reef and injuries due to any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the recommendations of the authorities, respect all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The cubozoans are found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770. Occasionally they can also be found outside of these months.
Sharks exist, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and stay away.
Marine crocodiles do not have an active life in the ocean; their main habitat is the estuaries of rivers in the north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of knowing that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation, or even combined packages with flight and hotel.
They can also maintain the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to submit other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any request or suggestion should be sent first to the travel agency and not to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of attendees choose to camp right there, and most attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to arrive early to secure a spot to camp near the music.
It is important to remember that even though the music may have ended on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival that continue playing well into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the Baltic north in winter, check the location of the cabin, because crossing the ice generates a terrible noise in the most affected areas.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include some time in the city. Passenger cruises are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos often strive to maximize the time and money that their visitors leave there. There are usually no windows or clocks, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special foods, drinks, and entertainment offers to entertain guests and prevent them from leaving the establishment.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages inside the house. Nevertheless, intoxication alters judgment, and all good gamblers know that it is important to stay sober.
Whoever drives at high latitudes or between mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or very low temperatures.
The friction is low on icy and snowy roads, and you can't drive on them as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snow storms, a significant amount of snow can fall, enough to get trapped in a very short time.
Visibility can also be reduced by falling or wind-displaced snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues without much interruptions throughout the year.
Probably safaris are the main tourist attraction in Africa and the most relevant for many tourists.
The term safari in popular usage refers to a trip on land to see the fantastic African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and the standard equipment will allow for good views.
Animals like lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, which is why you can see them better using binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as "rural hike", "hiking safari" or "footing") consists of hiking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the first Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you made the reservation for the flights and accommodations for the year 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a delicate situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March, most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were supposed to take place.
It is expected that most of the tickets to the event will cost between 2,500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, with a typical ticket around 7,000 ¥.
Ironing wet clothes can help to dry them. Many hotels can provide an iron and ironing board, even if there is none in the room.
If there is no iron available or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to overheat (it could shrink or, in extreme cases, scorch).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling the water for a minute is enough; in others, it takes a few minutes.
The effectiveness changes from filter to filter, and in case of concerns you should consider buying water from a well-known brand in sealed bottles.
Travelers may encounter animal pests with which they are not familiar in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or animals capable of hurting or killing people by force, are usually not considered pests.
Duty free purchases are an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and duties in certain places.
Travelers bound to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which frequently passes through isolated wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: steep slopes, narrow stretches, and tight turns predominate.
The speed limits indicated are significantly lower than those of previous and subsequent sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict obedience to the limits is even more important than it would be otherwise.
Although curious, the mobile phone service is more powerful here than in many other segments of the route, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German pastry is quite good and that of Bavaria is very abundant and diverse, similar to that of Austria, their southern neighbors.
The pastries with fruit are common, with baked apples inside the pastries all year round and cherries and plums that appear in the summer.
Many German products made in the oven also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other dried fruits. The most well-known pastries often pair well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small pastries, but full of flavor, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen according to the region.
A curry is a dish made from herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the northern interior regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a generic term to cover a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without any other qualifier, the term usually refers to the food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Nowadays, Javanese cuisine is easy to find all over the archipelago and offers a wide variety of simply spiced dishes. The favorite flavors of Javanese people are usually those of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang from each side of the saddle.
They are more stable for the rider, but they can present safety issues because the rider's feet could get trapped in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but has a foot stuck in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. In order to minimize this risk, various safety precautions can be taken.
To begin with, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a single thick and strong sole.
In addition, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to fall off the saddle if a rider falls backwards.
The Cochamó Valley: Chile's most prominent climbing destination, also known as the Yosemite of South America, features many large granite walls and cliffs.
There are impressive views from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world continuously establish new routes among its endless expanse of walls.
Alpine sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snowy slopes on skis or a surfboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, often known as "ski bums," who plan their entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
The concept of skiing is very ancient - there are cave paintings representing skiers from before 5000 BC!
The alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, but it was in 1861 when some Norwegians opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Traveling with a backpack on skis: this activity is also known as rural skiing, ski tourism, or ski touring.
It is related, but it generally does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter being carried out on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine a ski route as something similar to a hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover distances a little longer than walking - although on few occasions you will achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on flat tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. In normal circumstances, traveling between different countries would involve having to make many visa requests and passport controls.
The Schengen area, nevertheless, functions as a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
In the same way, having a Schengen visa eliminates the need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for manufactured items that are considered antiques. Some tax agencies determine that goods over 100 years old are considered antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Artisan products can be categorized as antiques, even though they are more recent than other similar mass-produced items.
The reindeer husbandry is an important means of subsistence among the Sami people and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many with other professions.
Even within the tradition, however, not all samis have been related to large-scale reindeer breeding, but rather lived from fishing, hunting, and the like, mainly using reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami territory.
Although it is widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the word "gitano" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you will visit is subject to any traffic alert, your travel or cancellation insurance may be affected.

Extreme weather condition is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, significant social disruptions, or loss of human lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur worldwide, and there are different types that may depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, sleet, excessive precipitation and uncontrolled fires are forms and effects of adverse weather phenomena, such as storms, tornadoes, water spouts and cyclones.
Among the severe regional and seasonal atmospheric phenomena are fog, snowstorms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of adverse weather that may affect their area as it could disrupt their travel plans.
Anyone who intends to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should take a professional training course.
A search on the internet for "Hostile environment course" will likely provide the address of a local company.
A normal course will usually cover all the problems that have been addressed here in better detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will normally last 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing games, plenty of first aid, and sometimes, weapon training.
Books and magazines that talk about survival in nature are common, but there are few publications that address war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery in another country must ensure they have the valid documents for the return trip.
The availability of governments to issue passports where the sex (X) is not specified or updated documents to show the desired name or sex varies.
The will of foreign governments to honor these documents can vary widely.
The security checkpoint screenings have also become much more invasive in the post-9/11 era.
Preoperative transgender individuals should not have to wait to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The rip currents are the flow that returns after the waves clash with the beach, often at a reef or similar.
Because of the water's topology, the return flow concentrates in a few deeper stations, and a strong current can form towards deep waters.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue in attempting to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you leave the current, swimming backwards is not any more difficult than usual.
Look to address yourself somewhere where you won't be captured again or, depending on your skills or if you have been informed, perhaps you want to wait for a rescue.
The return shock arrives before the cultural shock (with a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to the new culture often find it particularly difficult to readapt to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits from your native culture.
When you went abroad, at first people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Sometimes one does not foresee that patience and understanding are also necessary when travelers return home.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show starts.
Usually the sounds of tourists and vendors can be heard. The history of sound and light is almost like a tale.
The Sphinx establishes itself as a backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes of the story are shown on the pyramids, which light up at the same time.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are disputed among many nations and have the majority of bases, with sixteen of them active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others, there are the islands of Livingston and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the Peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge and form a plateau, then reemerge to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth mountains, separated by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a maximum of 4,892 m of Mount Vinson.
In distant locations with no phone coverage, satellite telephony may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, as it requires being outdoors with a clear line of sight to make a phone call.
The service is usually used in vessels, including recreational boats, as well as in expeditions that require remote data and voice.
Your local phone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
A popular option among people considering a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular among students who have not finished their studies, giving them the opportunity to take a year off before starting university, without compromising their education.
Enrolling in a sabbatical year course abroad often can improve the chances of starting higher education again in your country.
Typically there will be registration fees to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is an important sailing destination. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
Although any yacht can pass through the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sporting navigation is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every 7 or 8 people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it is equally quite special (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
The majority of the various Baltic cruises have a prolonged stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic center of the city using a couple of full days and returning to the ship to sleep at night.
If you only disembark with onshore excursions, you do not need a separate visa (dated 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany, on their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not anywhere near the sea and the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have never flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It is not a reason to be ashamed: there is no difference with the fears and personal apprehensions that many people express towards other things.
For some, having knowledge about how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear based on the unknown or lack of control.
The courier companies charge well to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important for business documents, merchandise or replacement parts for an urgent repair.
In some routes, the bigger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem with other routes and smaller companies.
If they are going to send the items by plane, there are routes where the unloading and customs clearance can take days.
The only way to send it faster was to do it as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow them to send baggage without a passenger carrying it, and this is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to pay a good amount of money for this privilege (or even better, have your company do it for you).
Now, this is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the price of the economy fare for business class, and up to eleven times for first class!
In general, it doesn't make sense to look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay more for the privilege of arriving at a place quickly and comfortably, and they are willing to pay accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chi?in?u. The official language is Romanian, but Russian is commonly used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has experienced ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, although it is not recognized by any member country of the United Nations.
The economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion of Moldova is the Orthodox Christian.

In the north, you can also visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place of well-known Marian apparitions around the world.
Please remember that you are basically visiting a mass grave and a site with almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived their stay here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't damage the place by painting or engraving graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Close to half prefer to speak in Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
Now, most of the signs are only in Catalan because it is, by law, the priority official language.

Regular messages on the metro are only in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced with an automated system in many languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The Parisians are famous for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Even though this is usually just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to behave well in Paris is to act as best as you can, behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make it much easier for you to move around.
The abrupt appearance of the Parisians will quickly disappear if you show a minimum of courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is very forested, with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and it is home to a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.

During visits to the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer coverings to women who are not prepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
In the same way, men also have to wear pants that cover their knees.
This item can also be requested at the entrance, but it is clothing that is not washed after every use, so maybe you will find it uncomfortable to wear these skirts. The size is one-size-fits-all!
The Mallorcan cuisine, like that of other similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.

Therefore, reading these basic concepts about grammar will help you a lot to learn Persian grammar and to better understand its sentences.
You don't need me to tell you that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who can speak a little Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is so similar that there is no need to study it separately.
The premodern observatories are mostly obsolete nowadays, and remain as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution was not a problem at the time as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those built today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, an action known as hanami, is part of Japanese culture from the 8th century onwards.
The concept comes from China, where the cherry blossom was the most prized.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
The plants present their best appearance when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to take "just one" specimen with you.
If you visit a formally arranged garden and pick any "samples", you will also be expelled without contemplation.
Generally, Singapore is an extremely safe place and very easy to navigate, and you can buy practically anything after arriving.
But by placing yourself in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also some buses that travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.

Christmas is one of the most important celebrations in Christianity, and it celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Non-believers in both Christian and non-Christian countries all over the world have also adopted many of the traditions surrounding the festivity.
There is a tradition of spending the Easter night doing the vigil in some open place to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is very plausible that it is a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
The most traditional churches often celebrate an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, and congregations usually start the celebrations at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the island did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
The great distance from the continent prevented mammals from reaching it, leading to the giant tortoise becoming the first grazing animal in the Galápagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galápagos, many mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs have been introduced there.
If you visit the areas of the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, you will experience the polar night, in which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will remain dark practically all day.
As the areas are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is not usually a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to seeing.
The suits are the standard business attire, and coworkers address each other by their last names or job titles.
