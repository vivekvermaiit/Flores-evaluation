This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but also provides details that fossils cannot give, such as color or three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the fur of this animal was chestnut-brown with light or carotenoid-colored lower edges.
The discovery also provides understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed structure called barbs but do have other feather characteristics - barbules and barbicels - the researchers concluded that the barb is probably a later evolutionary development than those other characteristics.
According to the structure of the feathers, it is assumed that they were not used for flying, but more likely for temperature regulation or display. The researchers speculated that the specimen shows adult plumage and not juvenile down, although it is a young dinosaur tail.
The explorers conjectured that the specimen shows adult plumage and not juvenile down, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur.

The completed work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observation made about the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team searched for the effect caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon applies a gravitational pull on the Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way applies force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter influences other dark matter in the way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that the darkest matter around a galaxy surrounds the galaxy like a halo and consists of many small particles.

In France, voting traditionally has been a technologically simple experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place the pre-printed ballot paper with their preferred candidate marked on it into an envelope.
After the officials confirm the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.

Candidates can send representatives to witness each phase of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under careful supervision, according to specific procedures.

The police of Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Assistant to the chief inspector D K Arya said: "We arrested five individuals who raped the Swiss woman, and we found her cell phone and laptop".
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car collided against it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver received serious injuries to the head.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
At first, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya remained in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then, accused of murdering his son.
She is being carefully watched while waiting for an official accusation and trial, but any witness testimony can be influenced, as her image has been widely publicized.
It is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish law operates differently, and courts consider the publication of photos potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists indeed seem to be approaching a dangerous line if they publish photos or other details about suspects."
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for prosecution, explained to journalists that no further comments will occur at least until the accusation is made.
The document, according to the link, references the dispute about borders that Palestine wants to have based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other related topics, reportedly, will include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA agrees to allow the presence for only five years.
Shooters in the trial of supportive pest control had to be carefully inspected by the foresters, while the trial was studied and its effectiveness assessed.
In partnership with NPWS and the Australian Sporting Shooters Association (NSW), qualified volunteers are chosen within the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Deputy to the Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at NPWS, the four selected shooters for the first culling operation received detailed instructions on safety and training.
Martelly yesterday was sworn in as a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's first CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of measures to move the country forward to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by a failed election organization, some postponed since 2011.
Around 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving minor burns on four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has informed that 27 accidents related to the appliances are known to it.
Last week MEKI announced that Apple informed it about 34 new incidents of discovery, which the company calls "minor".
The ministry reacted, calling the delay of the report by Apple "truly regrettable".
The earthquake shook Marion at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The crisis management office of the Northern Mariana Islands said that there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman took tourists from Hong Kong as hostages by capturing their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Some hostages were released, and it is confirmed that at least six people have died so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced an elderly woman who needed a restroom urgently. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in the example of his father and chose a career in medicine.
He learned as an obstetrician and started working at the National Women's Hospital of Auckland in 1959.
Working in the hospital, Liggins began to research premature birth during his spare time.
His research showed that the delivery of hormones accelerated the maturation of the fetal lung in the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes," flight recorders, on Wednesday.
Colleagues also honored the Lunar fighters.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away in the night of two moons. Quite unique, just like she was. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was just as strange as I am... maybe even more... I love her and I miss her... hopefully she is in a better place."
Out of 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the number of those opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard asserted during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the opinion poll share that viewpoint, wishing for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
In the extremes of public opinion, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic medalist had to swim 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relay races at the Community Games, but due to his complaints, his ability was doubted.
He could not use the necessary medicines to survive his pain, because they are prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number for today on January 25th.
Some people confirmed the discovery, using various devices and software, until the early days of February, and it was declared on Tuesday.
Comets may possibly be a source of water for the Earth, as well as of organic material that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his administration earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He mentioned the dreams as "political gossip and foolishness."
He will possibly try to run for president in 2016.
The NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA's assertions, will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, also reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, unlike older ground radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation will be operated, and the overland trains will not stop at Wembley, nor are there parking lots or park-and-ride facilities at the location.
Concern about the lack of transportation raised the likelihood that the game will be played compulsorily behind closed doors, without the support of the team.
On Thursday, a Science magazine study reported the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Explorers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process probably took more time, due to the mating between the endemic land finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be formed in the most diverse ways. It can be rolled into thin shapes.
One can pull it to get fine wire that can be folded and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into a sheet.
One can make it very thin and adhere it to another metal. It can be so thin that it was once used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
That is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red beet juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic the substance is.
The pH level indicates the quantity of hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the tested chemical substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean damp hands, press them into a ball shape.
Wetness on your hands will react with the external tables, making you feel strange and forming as if a shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a water-flushed toilet in almost every house, connected to a complex sewage system.
Remains of a sewage system were found in the houses of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Bathrooms were also present in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, bathrooms were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the phone call and reflects it down, almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and visual.
One needs a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing enabled by the wheel is the provision of much easier and faster transportation.
Because of it we have trains, cars and many other means of transportation.
Below them are larger cats, which eat medium-sized prey on the scale of rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Okay, there are many small cats (including stray pet cats) that eat a much larger prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, specialization, which every cat retains, so they don't have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats, they live in groups called prides.
The herd consists of one to three adult male parents and many to thirty females and offspring.
The women are usually in close kinship with each other, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs function quite similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, which surprisingly resemble lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to prey.
A very harmonious athlete, a tiger can climb (although not very well), swim, leap great distances, and pull five times stronger than a strong man.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a phrase of hoarse, screaming words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds whenever possible.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find edible animals (prey) by scent, sniffing out the tracks on the ground.
They can see well in the darkness using their night vision ability and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originated (such as if they cross a mountain or river, or if they relocate to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than where they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will have to have different traits or adaptations compared to those they needed before.
The original population did not change at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
With the passage of time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less similar to the other population.
Finally, with the passing of thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is a necessary consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe in, and they remove carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is vegetables. Without vegetables, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the tallest predator of its time, so it feared nothing except for other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an additional row in its palate, which means that nothing it encountered could escape.
It is not certain, but it is possible that it had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that entered the water, even giant dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus would stand no chance against it.
Although we recognized most of their food, the Romans did have their own set of strange or unusual festive items, including wild boar, turkey, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people ate their food sitting in chairs, rich men liked to have feasts together, where they would recline on their sides, eating their plates.
Among the dishes of Ancient Rome, there could not have been foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and also an internal sanctuary, which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The majority of the life of the Hebrew family occurred in the fresh air.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were simply open selling tables facing the street. They used stone to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norwegian sagas it is said that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder, and along the way further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes already lived there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776."
Although no one is certain who wrote it, it is known that in the early days of its existence the large parchment document (its dimensions are 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So probably the note was simply added as a label.
The landings of D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south remained still not free.
It was ruled by the French from "Vichy". These were French people who reconciled with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15th, 1940, the allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
After only two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
Civilization is a distinct culture possessed by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and also somehow defines the dimension of society.
City-states are ancestors of nations. Civilization culture includes the transmission of knowledge through several generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and sufficiently wide dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as suitable civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with Congress as its sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any power to collect taxes and, since there was no national executive or judiciary, it entrusted the implementation of its decisions to the state authorities, which often were not cooperative.
It also did not have the right to impose laws and customs duties between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before any change, and states related to the central government so easily that their representatives often were absent.
The national football team of Italy and also the national football team of Germany, are the second most successful team in the world and were champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among popular sports are soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, so Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has around 7000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the collection/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often called, in a geographic sense, an "archipelago".
The beginning of Taiwan started long ago in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, transforming the indigenous ways of rice production and hiring Chinese laborers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) occupied the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and proclaimed Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the sides of the complex were reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
Until 1976, 30 percent of the Machu Picchu centers had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format in the world for taking still images is 35 mm, which was the dominant film dimension at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but, more importantly, its proportion was inherited from the sensitive formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 34 mm high.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to receive the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Several popular formats (such as APS format) are equal to or very close to this ratio.
The much insulted and often underestimated rule of thirds is simply a guideline creating dynamism, maintaining a measure of order in the image.
It states that the most effective placement of the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the picture into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period in European history, the Catholic Church, becoming rich and powerful, became the subject of critical examination.
During more than a thousand years, the Christian religion connected European states despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its all-pervading power touched everyone from king to commoner.
One of the main Christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources exist specifically for that purpose.
For more than a thousand years, the central authority of the church was in Rome, and this concentration of power and money made many doubt whether that doctrine is obeyed.
Shortly after the outbreak of fighting, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved its effectiveness, it cut off crucial military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated a generally accepted international law codified by some international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain laid international mines to prevent the entry of any ships into entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Because such a tactic had a limited response, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted military use of submarines.
During the 1912s, the dominant attitude of the majority of citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and brutality of war during the First World War, nations desired to avoid a return of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take up a job position at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 patents, a poetry book, and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous workplace) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own way of showing different time periods; each era in China or each family that ruled was a separate dynasty.
Among all dynasties, there was also an unstable era of divided provinces. The most well-known of such periods was the Era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those periods, a furious battle occurred among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just to the ruler.
Other than posts after the Revolution were open to all male candidates, allowing the success of the most ambitious and successful.
The same is true of the soldiers, because instead of military ranks previously based on class, they are now based on personality.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people from the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohamed was deeply interested in matters outside of this everyday life. He frequented a cave, which became known as "Hira’" on Mount "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has been preserved through time, gives a clear image of the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
Located at the peak of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easily found, even if one knows that it exists. When one is in the cave, it is total isolation.
Nothing else is visible except the cloudless, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. Very little of this world is visible or audible from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid in Giza is one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramid structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, contains several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and among the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upward bow" mark looks like a V and the "downward bow mark" like a hook or square with no lower side.
Up means that you have to start at the top and push the bow, and down means that you have to start at the heel (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The bow up usually produces a more delicate sound, while the bow down is stronger and firmer.
Do not hesitate to add your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the printed arch marks are there for musical reasons, so they should usually be observed.
The frightened king Louis the 16th, queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, madame Elizabeth, were brought back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789 by a crowd of market women.
They traveled to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a crowd, making loud and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd made the king and queen widely open the windows of the carriage.
At some point, a crowd swung the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The military expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of Filipinos were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to reimburse a large part of the expenses and the interest on the obligations circulating in the name of the Filipino government through the banks of Wall Street.
Of course, the superprofits extracted from the extensive exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic income of US imperialism.
To understand the temple residents, it is necessary to understand the context that helped establish the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
Before the Middle Ages was the Early Middle Ages and it was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500 by consensus.
Technological determination is a term that practically covers a wide range of ideas, from technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by subconscious logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpreters of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the evolution of technology largely follows a path beyond cultural or political influences, and that technology similarly has essentially unique "consequences" for societies, and not socially conditioned.
One could say, for example, that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for only a handful of cars, so new methods of production are being designed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Widespread car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the road, which has led to the invention of new healthcare techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, taken from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time customs and culture related to that geography appeared, and those more in harmony with the place of society were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a luxury epicenter began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 AD.
In the twelfth century, its status declined mainly because the crusaders returned with silk and spices considered more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at that time that the title Fashion Capital transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style had its peak during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, the Byzantine culture had a great influence on fashion in the east.
However, due to slow communication devices, styles in the West could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the important achievements of the period was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes as a result of the Crusades.
Sustainable agriculture is agriculture done to produce enough food for the needs only of the farmer and his/her family.
Resilient agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using saved indigenous seeds for the eco-region with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, the majority of farmers have been involved in subsistence agriculture and this still holds true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together people with similar viewpoints, who feel unnoticed by social norms, and allow them to grow their sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguishable based on age, ethnic background, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The determining factors for a subculture as separate, can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Subcultures often sign their membership through recognizable and symbolic use of style, including fashion, attitude, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to mention the few regrettable occurrences of children who, during their upbringing, due to neglect, misfortune or malicious mistreatment, were not socialized by adults.
Such children are referred to as "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been liberated by humans (usually their own biological parents); in some cases, such abandonment of a child was due to the parent's rejection of the child's serious intellectual or physical handicap.
Wild children could endure severe mistreatment or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others were supposedly raised by animals; some reportedly lived in nature by themselves.
Having been raised by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limitations) almost entirely similar to those of the particular nurturing animal, as well as its fear or indifference towards humans.
During project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes another step.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a tool that provides support to individuals within a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, an instructor is a variation of scaffolding and the small paperclip in Microsoft Office.
A virtual scaffold is built into the software and should ask, suggest, and clarify procedures that may be difficult for the learner to do on their own.
Children find themselves in a guardianship authority for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not supportive, caring, and nurturing, but it happens.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe zone for such children.
Our care system must provide secure homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare protection.
Curatorship must provide everything necessary that was lacking to them in the house from which they were previously taken.
The internet connects elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The special features of the Internet give additional dimensions to the theory of uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivational aspects when they explored public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
Esperanto sentence: Especially, it is claimed that it is possible to guess whether a person is lying through accurate interpretation of microexpressions. Translator: Especially, it is claimed that it is possible to guess whether a person is lying through accurate interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks in his article The President's Speech indicated that people who cannot understand speech due to a brain injury can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even supposes that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be possessed by animals such as domestic dogs.
The research in the 20th century showed that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and represented.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the visible variation group.
Mutation and recombination remix the variation back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for primates with a digestive system like humans to meet their needs for amino acids from available vegetation.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences: decrease in growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible resources of nutrients would be proteins obtained from leaves and beans, but those are difficult to digest for primates like us, if they are not cooked.
Male, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide high-quality proteins that contain essential amino acids.
Considering all circumstances, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" somehow similar to how chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep inertia is the process of intense awakening during your usual sleep period and falling back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
You can easily do this by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake up without fully waking up.
If you notice that you keep checking the clock while you sleep, it may be left on the other side of the room, which will make you get up to turn it off.
Among other options based on biorhythms is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known diuretic) before bed, this will make you get up to urinate.
The extent of internal peace that a person has negatively correlates with the extent of tension in the body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive force there is in life. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle on the path to that goal is your own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded through the Mahayana path of love and through many techniques from Indian yoga.
Principally, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
In the center of Tibetan meditation is the Kundalini yoga. By visualizing different deities, one purifies the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates the illuminated consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures caused the division of the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies, and the cold war began.
It lasted the following 40 years and having real battles with replacement armies in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On the 17th of September 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, the only hope remained to retreat and reorganize according to the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell apart almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, breaking the Riga non-aggression pact, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international contracts, and creating double and multiple fronts.
Using ships for the transportation of goods is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional work of the navy was to ensure that your country retained the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time preventing your enemy from moving their people and goods.
The most noteworthy of the recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, tried to halt that traffic.
If the alliances were to fail, Germany could likely conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes domesticated them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Homebred goats were generally kept in wandering herds on hills and other pastures, often tended by goatherds, who were often children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd. These breeding methods are still used today.
Railways were constructed in England since no later than the 16th century.
Although wagon roads consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach faster speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of that time.
The ties appeared early enough to hold the tracks in place. However, it became clear that the tracks would be more effective if they had an iron strip on top.
That became a popular practice, but iron caused a faster wearing out of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were presented.
The earliest known form of transportation was by walking, people began walking upright around two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not often walk upright.
Bipedal specialization is found in the fossils of australopithecines from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus likely walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start relating more friendlily to the environment, we can join the environmental protection movement and we can even be activists to somehow reduce future suffering.
That is like symptomatic medication in many cases. However, if we want not only a temporary solution, then we must find the causes of the problems and we must deactivate them.
Of course, the world has greatly changed with the scientific and technological achievements of humanity, and problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and unsustainable living habits of humanity.
After the Congress accepted it on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the congressional president John Hancock and the secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the press of John Dunlap, a few blocks away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap's Posters".
The first public reading of the document was performed by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on the 8th of July.
One was sent on the 6th of July to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on the 9th of July. A copy came to London on the 10th of August.
The 25 posters by Dunlap, of which we know to exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is now living. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs, like a tyrannosaurus.
Almost all currently used computers are based on processing information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, using computer slang.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough to prevent an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container of medication or a poisonous household chemical.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term "cimo" is rarely used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term derives from a long familiarity with lice, which are insects highly adapted to parasitism of humans.
Rabbits and lizards are both nidicolous, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Throughout the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have found that women have twice the likelihood of developing MS than men.
A couple can decide that raising a child does not adhere to their interests, or the interests of their child, the best.
Such couples can choose to plan adoption for their baby.
During the adoption process, the biological parents waive their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand, through the scientific method, how the world functions. This method actually guides most of scientific research.
It is not alone; testing is also an experiment, and experimentation is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, questioning and observation guide scientific exploration.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on texts, especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's viewpoints on all topics of science, including psychology, were accepted.
During the decline of Greek scholarship, the West became evident of being disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often critically depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and how the biological clock produces them.
Periodic rhythms, which do not simply respond to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for the majority of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue a period of repetitive self-sustaining functioning even without external stimuli.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the leading evidences that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, marking either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the severity of the involved piece of genetic material, and whether the involved cells are germ line cells.
Only mutations in the cells of the germ line can be passed on to offspring, while mutations in other locations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the wildlife, including flora and fauna.
Among the examples of local activities are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
Example is to visit Borneo and there photograph and learn about orangutans.
Every morning, people leave the town by car to go to their workplace, and are passed by others whose goal is the place they just left.
In this dynamic navigation, everyone is involved and contributing in a transportation system based on the use of private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy shaped the biosphere of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Every person participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developing countries, one rarely hears similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transportation systems follow such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual pedestrians and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow, because one cannot foresee the behavior of a driver with hundred-percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a fairly uniform arrangement; thus traffic flows tend to have a certain moderate uniformity and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better present traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
Those relationships help to plan, develop, and operate road infrastructures.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily avoid enemies and to more efficiently find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider selection of small hiding places against thieves.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seemed prudent, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the water that flows into the ocean from the rivers of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The main river Amazon is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It collects water from several thousand smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Empire, no one ever succeeded in surpassing the pyramids of Giza in terms of size and technical skill in their construction.
The Egyptians of the New Empire marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, who had then lived for over a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
The city of Vatican uses the Italian language in its laws and official relations.
The Italian language is also the everyday language used by the majority of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements—such as gold, silver, and copper—since antiquity, because these can be found in nature in their basic form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements. It was about earth, water, air, and fire.
That was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he continued to theorize that they become new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Certainly, there are also metals like silver and gold.
One can also have alloys, consisting of small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so unbelievably small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was a great help for many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, due to the emergence of new ways of writing, the pencil has lost its former status and use.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever needing to approach a pencil.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along.
The physical bomb functions according to the principle that energy is needed to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's similar to pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the nucleus then releases some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to decay with some or no provocation.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner beneath the seas and thicker beneath the mountains.
There may be additional seas on the nearby side, because the crust is less thick. It was easier for the lava to spill onto the surface.
Contained theories focus on discovering what motivates people to act or challenge them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized during maturation into adulthood.
These theories explore what is about certain people, what makes them desire the things they do, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two ways of behaving can emerge when administrators begin to lead their former equals. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the friends" (or girl friends).
This type of manager rarely makes unpopular decisions, carries out disciplinary actions, evaluates the efficiency of work, assigns tasks, and demands accountability from people.
On the other side of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual, who feels that he or she must change everything that the team previously did, and appropriate it.
The leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Such behavior often results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same high-quality standards as traditional teams, but there are some fine differences.
Members of virtual teams often function as the point of contact for their distributed physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a traditional team, as their teams can meet across different time zones, which may not be understood by their local administrators.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the administrative team, to which each of the members reports. The invisible team establishes norms for each member.
Why would an organization like to go through the temporary process of setting up a learning organization? One goal for practically using the concepts of organizational learning is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used through the functioning departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can appear.
As a result, the process when an organization works together to overcome an obstacle, can lead to a new process to meet the needs of clients.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and also of shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies Continuous Access as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to the investigation of cognition. It thus broadens the scope of exploration and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior motivates scientists to continue their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain defects, traumas, injuries, and tumors influence behavior and change some mental functions.
The progress of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that were previously never seen.
That provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulations, which help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong tinge of science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science, which deals with learning and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Exploration in AI involves the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Among examples are monitoring, planning and encouragement, ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, and also recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
Those things became separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Systems of AI are now often used in the fields of economy, medicine, engineering, and military, it is also incorporated into some home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are an important part of any education. Quite often a teacher would like to take their students to places inaccessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual excursions. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art, sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is another great way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students of Bennet School in North Carolina produce a webpage about their trip to the state capital, a new version of the webpage appears every year, but the old versions remain accessible for use as a photo album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing of learners. While learners often start their blogging experience with faulty grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Because learners are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also makes learners more understanding about the world around them." The need to nurture public interest inspires learners to be wise and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages learners to expand learning beyond the traditional classroom.
The appropriate use of blogs "can enable learners to become more analytical and critical; actively responding to online materials, learners can define their positions in the context of others' writing and also outline their own point of view on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming bilingual capital of Canada and it has a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is the Niagara Waterfall and the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
These and other matters highlight Ontario as what outsiders essentially think of as Canadian.
Vast areas further north are sparsely populated, some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Here is a comparison of populations that surprises many: there are more African-Americans in the US than Canadian citizens altogether.
The Islands of East Africa are situated on the Indian Ocean, at the eastern border of Africa.
Madagascar is incomparably the largest and, in terms of fauna, it is an independent continent.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent countries or linked to France, and known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region and it became deeply rooted in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and colonization of Europe began in the 15th century, when the explorer Vasco da Gama from Portugal initiated the sea route from Europe to India.
The region borders the Sahel region to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women notice that cultural differences can result in what would be considered harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, restrained by the arm, etc.
Be firm when you disagree with proposals from men and do not fear to offend (whether culturally or not, difference is not necessarily tolerable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and it was used by Phoenicians, Romans, and the Benimerines as a strategic port under the name Anfa.
Destroyed by the Portuguese, it was rebuilt by them with the name Casa Branca, but they left after the earthquake in 1755.
The city was reconstructed by the sultan of Morocco under the name Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there, called it Casablanca.
In terms of shopping, Casablanca is among the least interesting places throughout Morocco.
Around the old town center, it is easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan products, such as textiles, ceramics, leather goods, narghiles and a whole range of trinkets, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, covering most of the urban streets with its magma, mainly in the city center.
Goma offers sufficient security, but one must inquire about each visit outside of it to know the status of the ongoing battles in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano in addition to the cheapest tracking of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to travel through Goma. The normal (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
In addition to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today Timbuktu is a impoverished city, but it is a tourist attraction because of its reputation and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was inscribed in the red list of world heritage sites because of the threatening sands from the desert.
It was one of the most important stops during the PBS special program Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts greatly with the other cities in the country, as it has a style more Arab than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, north to Zimbabwe, and south to the Crocodile River.
The park encompasses 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 separate ecosystems, all of which support diverse wildlife.
It presents one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the most iconic among the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Same as all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation entrance fees for the park.
It is also useful to buy the Wild Card, which provides entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and it is the place that many tourists consider the most interesting.
The line of buildings that creates the Hong Kong city skyline was compared to a shining histogram, which is evident due to the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the waterfront located at the edge of Kowloon.
The vast majority of the urban growth of the island of Hong Kong is densely concentrated on land gained from the sea at the northern coastline.
This is the place which the British colonists appropriated for themselves, and therefore, if one is looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, here is a convenient place to search.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest contiguous mangrove forest, spanning 80 km (50 miles) along the coastline into Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was declared a world heritage site by UNESCO. The part of the forest in the Bangladeshi territory is named Sundarbans National Park.
The forest, however, is not just a swamp of mangroves. In it are some of the last refuges of the imposing jungles that once covered the vast plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², of which approximately one third is covered by water or marshes.
In 1966, Sundarbans became a reserve and it is estimated that there are currently 400 royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer within its territory.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) all day, but most depart between 6:30 and 7:30, especially those traveling west to Jakar or Bumthang.
Because the inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
The majority of the districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Common taxis are fast and comfortable means of transportation for traveling to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a border crossing point. It spans the Oyapock River, linking the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l’Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters tall, 378 meters wide and have two corridors that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical underpass under the bridge is 15 meters away. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The plan is for the bridge to be fully functional in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to have been completed.
The Guaraní were the most remarkable indigenous group living in that place, which is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters, who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was the home of other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as "The Great Province of Indians", arose as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began an era of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since then, when Asuncion was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentinos are very well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December in the polo fields at Las Cañitas.
Here you can also watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
Check with the Argentine Polo Association for news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value has been pegged to that of the British pound (GBP).
Money is exchangeable at the only bank on the islands, which is located in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
Throughout the islands, British pounds are generally accepted, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
On the outer islands, credit cards are likely not accepted, but you can use British and American currency; ask beforehand to find out which payment method is accepted.
Because it is almost impossible to change Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, change the money before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, it has summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, the temperature usually exceeds 30 °C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is almost the same throughout the whole year.
Although many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to the presence of humans, the animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The authorities of the park request that you stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful they may appear, the bison, elk, deer, bears, and almost all animals are capable of attacking.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they are not keeping themselves at a proper distance. Because these animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, please respect their space.
In addition, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly foods and keep the campsite clean.
The city of Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and is home to just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The harbor was the site of the famous sea battle in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Around 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the efforts towards independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city led to the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches thanks to its location between two harbors. The most popular are in three regions.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all have sandy beaches where one can safely swim, and most have shade from pohutukava trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the Waitemata Harbour in the luxurious suburbs Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in Central Auckland.
They are sometimes full of people family beaches where shops line the shore abundantly. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is Number One. It is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called Manta.
There are many drinkable wines from France, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may possibly be better value.
It is completely safe to drink the tap water, but bottled water is easy to find if one has concerns.
Australian's find the idea of "flat white" coffee foreign. Espresso is "short black", cappuccino has abundant foam (not froth) and tea is consumed without milk.
The hot chocolate conforms to Belgian standards. The sugars are more expensive but excellent.
Throughout the whole year, many excursions to the reef occur and injuries due to any of these causes are rare.
Follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signals, and pay close attention to security warnings.
Cubozoans appear near beaches and estuaries, from October to April, north of 1770. They can occasionally appear outside of that time.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. The majority of sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away from them.
Sea crocodiles do not actively live in the sea. Their main habitat is estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Early booking gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a room upon arriving at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, but you may be able to book special accommodations, such as campgrounds, through such agents.
Travel agents generally offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements for arrival and departure at the airport, or even combined packages with flights and hotels.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or to provide other documents for the intended location (for example a visa).
All changes or requests must be directed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, the majority of the attendees choose to camp on-site and most consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you will have to enter early to grab a spot near the music.
Remember that music on the main stages may have ended, but there may be parts of the festival where it will be playing continuously until late at night.
Some festivals provide special tent areas for families with young children.
If you sail the northern Baltic in winter, beware of the location of the cabin, as walking on ice causes quite a terrible noise in those most affected.
Pleasure ships to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Passengers from pleasure ships are visa-free (check conditions).
Casinos typically try to make guests spend the maximum of their time and money. Windows and clocks are usually not present and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special dishes, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and to retain them inside.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks, but intoxication impairs mental ability and every good card player knows how important it is to be sober.
Everyone who will drive a vehicle in high latitudes or across mountain passes should be aware that there may be snow, ice or frost.
On roads with ice or snow, friction is minimal and therefore one cannot drive as if on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, the snow blanket is able to block you and can fall very quickly.
Visibility can also be limited by either falling or blowing snow, condensation, or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather is normal in many countries, but traffic flows mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is possibly the most attractive thing for tourists in Africa and the most outstanding for many visitors.
The word "safari" is popularly used with the meaning of a land journey to observe the amazing African fauna, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and ordinary tools provide a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards sometimes appear fearful, so binoculars will help you see them better.
A hiking safari (also called "bushwalk", "walking safari", or "hiking") consists of walking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will take place between August 24th and September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Having hosted the games in 1964, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympics.
If you booked the flights and accommodations for 2020, before the postponement was announced, you are likely in a complicated situation.
Policies of lockdown are varied, but regarding late March, the majority of lockdown policies based on coronavirus did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were planned.
It is expected that tickets for the majority of events will cost from 2500 to 130,000 ENJs, and that typical tickets will cost around 7000 ENJs.
Wetting clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have ironing boards and irons available for loan, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or one does not want to wear ironed socks, one may try using a dryer, if it is available.
Be careful that the fabric does not get too hot (which can shrink it or, in extreme cases, cause it to burn).
There are different methods to purify water, but some are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is enough, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters have different efficiencies, so if you care about that, consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal diseases that are not known in their home regions.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation or, worst of all, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transport infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals capable of harming or killing a person by force are generally not considered plagues.
Tax-free shopping is the possibility to purchase goods without taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, sometimes passing through isolated wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be extremely cautious: there are mostly steep slopes, narrow corridors, and winding corners.
Signal speeds are remarkably lower than those of previous and following sections - often 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and they are strictly to be obeyed, even more so than otherwise.
It is remarkable that the postal phone service is still much stronger here than in many other sections of the road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German meats are very tasty and in Bavaria they are very rich and distinctive, similar to those of the neighbor in the south, Austria.
There are many fruit pastries that contain either apples all year round, or cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular pastries typically pair especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, taste those called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen according to the region.
Kareaĵo is a dish consisting of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
Meat can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually added to meat; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 selectable islands, Indonesian cuisine is a term encompassing a wide range of regional cuisines across the country.
Without additional qualifying words, the term generally means the culinary art originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
