This confirms the widely spread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also information was obtained that is not usually found in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
The animal's feather coat was, according to researchers, chestnut brown on the outside and light or carotenoid-colored underneath.
Additionally, the finding helps to understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed central shaft called a rachis, but they have other feather features such as barbs and barbules, researchers concluded that the rachis is likely a later stage of evolution of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying but for heat regulation or courtship displays. Although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, researchers suggested that the sample came from an adult individual's feather coat rather than a chick's down.

The work done was primarily theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team hoped to observe the effects of tides between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the gravitational pull of the moon affects the Earth, causing tides, so does the gravitational pull of the Milky Way affect the Sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy.
The researchers were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, the majority of the galaxy's dark matter surrounds it as a kind of halo and consists of a large amount of small particles.

Schneider gave his testimony about the U.S. Air Force base located in his home country via video call.
On Wednesday's competition, Carpanedo also participated in two other individual competitions at the World Championships.
The first one was slalom, where his first run was interrupted. 36 out of 116 participants also failed to reach the finish line.
In her second competition, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting category with a total time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 slower than the first-place finisher Claudia Loesch from Austria and 1:09.02 slower than the ninth-place finisher Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers from the women's seated group were unable to complete their run, and 45 out of 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom did not place in the competition.
The police in Madhya Pradesh found a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman, and found her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are reported as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in the courtroom with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
The driver sustained serious head injuries, however.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services were freeing the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to James Paget Hospital located in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
He is detained awaiting charges and trial, but eyewitness evidence may have been compromised as his picture has been widely published.
The practice is common elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system operates differently, and the courts have considered that publishing images may be detrimental to a fair trial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from Dundeen University states that "journalists do seem to be balancing dangerously if they publish photos of suspects etc."
The Crown Office, Scotland's public prosecution service responsible for prosecuting, has indicated to journalists that they will not comment further on the case until charges are brought.
According to the leak, the document refers to a border dispute in which Palestine wants the borders to follow the same line as they did before the 1967 Middle East war.
According to the information, other topics discussed included the future status of the holy Jerusalem for both nations and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands continuous military presence in the valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement. The Palestinian Authority only accepts this kind of presence for five years.
The forest rangers were supposed to closely monitor the shooters participating in the supplementary monitoring experiment for pests, as the experiment was being monitored and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
Volunteers who meet the requirements were recruited as part of a joint project between the National Park and Wildlife Service and the New South Wales Sporting Shooters Association, as well as part of the shooting association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director responsible for the protection of NPWS parks and cultural heritage, the four selected shooters received comprehensive safety and training guidance for the initial shootings.
Martelly acknowledged nine members at yesterday's meeting of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth interim electoral council in four years.
The delegation appointed by the President recommended last month the resignation of the previous interim election council as part of a package of measures aimed at leading the country towards new elections.
The delegation was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that started in October.
The occasionally violent protests originated from the failed elections, some of which were supposed to be held as early as 2011.
Incorrectly functioning iPods have been reported to overheat in approximately 60 cases, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four individuals.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) of Japan said that it was aware of 27 incidents related to devices.
Last week the ministry announced that Apple had reported to them 34 other cases of overheating, which the company referred to as "non-serious".
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of Apple's report "really unfortunate."
An earthquake shook the Marianas at 7:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 Greenwich Mean Time).
The Northern Mariana Islands' emergency management agency said that there were no reported damages in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no indications of a tsunami occurring.
The former Filipino police officer has held Hong Kong tourists hostage after he hijacked their bus in the Philippine capital Manila.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as well as Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly woman when she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza died in the shooting.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that administering the hormone accelerates the development of the fetus' lungs.
Xinhua reported that the official research team found two black boxes, or flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also showed respect to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night with two moons. A very unique case just like she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was as crazy as I am... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place."
Before the federal parliamentary elections in 2010, a survey of 1,400 respondents was conducted. The number of opponents to changing into a republic of Australia had increased by 8 percent from 2008.
During the 2010 federal parliamentary elections campaign, Prime Minister Julia Gillard of the Ministry of Delivery claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
34 percent of survey participants shared his view and wanted Queen Elizabeth II to remain as Australia's last monarch.
At the two extremes of the study, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic champion was supposed to compete in the Commonwealth Games' 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle swimming events and three relay races, but his fitness has been uncertain due to pain.
He has not been able to take the necessary pain relief medication because their use is prohibited in the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of computer science and mathematician at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Multiple people confirmed the discovery by the beginning of February using different devices and software, and it was reported on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth as well as organic material that can form proteins and support life.
Researchers hope to understand how planets are formed, and specifically how Earth was formed, as comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
53-year-old Cuomo's term as governor began earlier this year, and last month he signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political jawboning and laughable".
It is estimated that he will run for president in 2016.
The aviation authority of the United States claims that NextGen is a system that allows airplanes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Satellite-based technology is used instead of the older ground-based technology. This way, air traffic controllers can locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more reliable information about their position.
Extra transportation is not provided and overground trains do not stop at Wembley. There are also no parking and park and ride services available at the venue.
The concern about the lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
The study published in the Science magazine on Thursday reported on the development of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University and Uppsala University reported that a new species had developed in just two generations, even though the event sequence was expected to last much longer. The reason was the interbreeding between the native Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortis) and the invasive cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can also be rolled into tiny objects.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and it can be attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was once used in hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH value of the chemical. The meter can be made by using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the substance is.
The amount of hydrogen ions (pH H) in the tested chemical indicates the pH value.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean and wet hands.
The moisture of your hands reacts to the outer layer, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
In almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, there was a flush toilet connected to a complex sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where women and men bathed at the same time in the same facilities.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite located in space receives a phone call and then reflects it back almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space on the back of a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To send a satellite or a telescope into space, a giant rocket over 100 feet long is needed.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways. Easier and faster transportation is the greatest thing that the bicycle has done for us.
It has given us a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
Underneath them come the medium-sized cat species, which eat medium-sized prey from hares to antelopes and deer.
Then there are many small feline animals (including loose pet cats) that eat small prey animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds, the numbers of which are much larger.
The secret of their success is the so-called ecological niche. According to this concept, every feline has its own special role, which is why they do not compete with others.
The lions are the most social of the feline animals, and they live in large groups called prides.
The herds consist of one to three adult males that are genetically related to each other, as well as sometimes up to thirty females and offspring.
Females are usually closely related to each other forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave much in the same way as wolf or dog packs. These animals display surprisingly similar behavior to lions (but not to other big cats), and they too are very dangerous to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (although not very well), swim, jump far, and pull five times as strongly as a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same genus of large cats (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four big cats are able to roar.
The roar of a tiger does not resemble the rich roar of a lion, but rather a series of growled, shouted words.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals. They prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can catch them. Almost all of the animals that ocelots prey on are much smaller than themselves.
Researchers believe that wolverines track and locate edible animals, or prey, by sniffing the ground for their scent.
The lynx have excellent night vision thanks to their ability to see in the dark, and move very stealthily. They hunt by blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population it originated from (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river, or to a new island, so that it is not easy to move back), its environment is often different than before.
The resources of the new environment are different and the competitors are different, so in order to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations than before.
The original population has not changed at all, but still needs the same adaptations as before.
As a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it gradually begins to resemble the main population less and less over time.
After thousands or even millions of years, both populations appear so different from each other that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the birth of a new species. Speciation is a necessary consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe in, and they use carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants produce their food by photosynthesizing from the sun. In addition, they provide shade.
We build our house from plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
In its long jaws protruded over 70 razor-sharp teeth, in addition to which it had an extra row of teeth in the palate, so nothing in its path could escape.
We are not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water. Even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus Rex wouldn't have stood a chance against it.
Most of their food would be familiar to us, but the Romans also had their own peculiar or unusual festive delicacies, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called a dormouse.
The second difference was that the poor and women ate their food sitting on a chair, but the rich preferred to organize communal feasts, where they lounged on their sides while eating their meals.
In the ancient Roman meals, it was not possible to serve food that only arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They did not have, for example, corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests sought to fulfill the needs of the gods with ceremonies and celebrations.
In each temple there was an open inner courtyard and then an inner sanctum, the so-called holy of holies, which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built in temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not as important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
The women were cooking food outside, and the shops were just open sales tables on the streets. The houses were built with stone as the construction material.
In Canaan, there were no extensive forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norwegian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, the Eskimo tribes already lived on the island at that time.
Although every country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
It's not true, however. Even though something is written behind the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The writing is upside down at the bottom of the document.
No one knows for certain who wrote them, but it is known that a large parchment document (measuring 29 ¾ inches by 24 ½ inches) was rolled up for storage in the early days.
It is likely that the entry was added only as if to a name tag.
D-Day, or the landings and subsequent battles, had liberated Northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was under so-called Vichy France, meaning the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders rather than fighting against them.
The Allies attacked southern France on August 15, 1944. The code name for the attack was Operation Dragoon.
The forces of the United States and Free France liberated Southern France in just two weeks and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a culture that is common to a large group of people living and working together in cooperation, society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civilian or citizen. It is related to the Latin word civis, meaning citizen or subject, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it also kind of defines the size of a society.
City-states are predecessors of nations. Civilizational culture refers to the transmission of knowledge from one generation to another, long-term cultural legacy and widespread dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving necessary historical evidence, so they are generally not considered true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states first formed a weak central government - the only part of which was the Congress - based on the Articles of Confederation.
At the Congress, there was no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive authority or judiciary, it had to rely on often uncooperative state authorities to enforce its regulations.
It also did not have the authority to change tax laws and interstate customs duties.
The amendment of articles required unanimous approval from all states, and the states were so dismissive of the central government that their representatives often weren't present.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful in the world alongside the German national team. It won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motorsports.
Winter sports are the most popular in northern regions, and Italians compete in them even in international matches and in the Olympics.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), so Japan is the seventh largest island in the world!
Since the islands of Japan are attacked or grouped, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in a geographical sense.
Taiwan was already known in the 1400s when passing European sailors mentioned the island, using the name Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in Southwest Taiwan in 1624. This also initiated a change in the original population's crop production methods and hired Chinese workers for their rice and sugar plantations.
During the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912), the military forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan in 1683 and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Dynasty in 1885.
After experiencing defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War in 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which resulted in the cession of Taiwan's self-governing rights to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: these are Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better sense of their original appearance.
30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and the restoration continues even now.
For example, the most common size used in still images is 35 mm. It was the prevalent film size at the end of the era of analog film.
It is still being produced, but most of all, digital camera image sensor formats have inherited its aspect ratio.
Slightly confusingly, the 35 millimeter size is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio for this size (when divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) either match or are very close to this aspect ratio.
The often misused and much mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism in the image while still maintaining some level of order.
According to it, the most efficient location of the main object is where the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally intersect (see example).
During this era of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church began to be closely scrutinized.
Christianity had united European countries for over a thousand years despite differences in languages and customs.
The all-encompassing power reached everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's financial resources are intended for exactly that purpose.
The central power of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many question the implementation of the doctrine.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective in cutting off vital supply deliveries for both military personnel and civilians, even though the blockade violated commonly accepted international law, which various international agreements had codified over the previous two hundred years.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from accessing entire sea areas, causing danger even to neutral vessels.
Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare, as the tactics only elicited limited responses.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and states were pacifism and isolation.
Nations decided to avoid a similar situation in the future after witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to take a job at Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of depicting different time periods: each phase or ruling dynasty in China was its own dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty, there was a time of unstable division of the provinces. The most famous of these periods was the 60-year period of the Three Kingdoms between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this time period, many nobles fought fiercely in their pursuit of the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died fighting for the chance to sit on the highest throne of the magnificent palace in Xi'an.
There were many societal and political consequences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to republicanism, the national idea, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, positions were also opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applied to the army, as the military ranks were now based on ability instead of social class.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working classes of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters outside of everyday life. He often went to meditate in a cave known as Hira, located on the light-signifying Nur mountain.
The cave itself, left untouched by the ravages of time, creates a vivid impression of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on one of the mountains rising to the north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if one knows it exists. Once inside the cave, the isolation is complete.
There is only a clear, beautiful sky above and many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, you can see or hear very little of the earthly world.
In the Giza necropolis located on the Giza plateau in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, there are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small burial chambers, several temples, and the Great Sphinx of Giza.
The Great Pyramid of Egypt, built by the Egyptians in the 200th century BCE, is one of many great pyramid-shaped structures that were built in honor of deceased pharaohs.
Several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx belong to the Giza necropolis, located on the Giza plateau in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The mark of a rising spring looks like a V and the mark of a falling spring is like a staple or a square without an underscore.
The rising bow means that you should start from the tip and push the bow. The descending one means that you should start from the frog (where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
From a rising bow usually comes a softer sound, a descending bow is stronger and more solid.
You are free to add your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed suspension marks are there for musical reasons and should generally be followed.
A crowd consisting of working class women forced the horrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister Elisabeth from Versailles back to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They came back to Paris in carriages as a crowd surrounded them and shouted threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At some point, someone from the crowd was waving the head of a killed royal guard in front of the shocked queen in Versailles.
The Filipinos themselves had to pay for the war costs caused by the American imperialism's conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the United States colonial administration, which covered a significant portion of the costs, and to take care of the interest on bonds issued by Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
The basic benefit of U.S. imperialism naturally consisted of the massive profits obtained from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos.
In order to understand the Templar knights, one needs to understand the background against which the organization was founded.
The era of events is usually referred to as the high Middle Ages, a period in European history between the years 1000 and 1300 AD.
The early Middle Ages were preceded by the early Middle Ages, and then came the late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that practically covers a wide range of ideas about the so-called technology push force, i.e. the necessity of technology leading to an absolute belief that human destiny is guided by scientific laws and the logic based on their manifestation in technology.
In most interpretations of technological determinism, there are two common basic ideas: first, that the development of technology follows a path that is largely beyond the reach of cultural and political influence, and second, that technology itself has inherent rather than socially conditioned "effects" on societies.
As an example, one could argue that the invention of the car inevitably leads to the development of roads.
On the other hand, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to decrease the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars leads to a higher number of accidents in road traffic, which in turn leads to the development of new healthcare methods for repairing damaged bodies.
Cultural determinism was a significant element in romanticism and inspired by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was seen to shape individuals. Over time, typical manners and culture formed for this geographical location. Because these were in harmony with society, they worked better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe in the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world.
Its reputation as the center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
Its position weakened in the 1100s mainly because the crusaders had returned home with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
At that moment, the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was at its peak between the turn of the 900s and 1000s and the 1300s.
Initially, the clothes were strongly influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
Due to the slow communication channels, Western European styles could however be 25-30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the era was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes, especially during the crusades.
Self-sufficiency farming is cultivation where enough food is produced only to sustain the farmer and his family.
Self-sufficiency is a simple, often organic-based system using locally adapted seeds combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel rejected by society's norms, and in this way they are able to develop their own identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished based on age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or the gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as its own and separate can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender or sexuality related, geographical, or combinations of several different factors.
Members of the subculture often communicate their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, behavior, and their own slang.
One of the most common methods of demonstrating the importance of socialization is to use as an example those few unfortunate children who, in the course of their upbringing, were deprived of adult-provided socialization due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse.
Such children are referred to as "wild". In some cases, rejection has been due to parents rejecting the child's serious intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some are claimed to have been raised by animals, while others are said to have lived on their own in the wild.
If a feral child is raised entirely by some other animal than a human, they will behave (within the limits of their physical abilities) almost entirely in the same way as their caretaker animal, for example by showing similar fear or indifference towards humans.
The purpose of project-based learning is to make learning easier and more interesting. The timely support of learning (scaffolding) takes it a step further.
The ladder is not a learning method, but a tool that supports individuals in a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The ladder can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a kind of ladder, but so is the small paperclip of Microsoft Office.
Virtual ladders are built into the software, and their purpose is to ask questions, give instructions, and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the learner without anyone's help.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and supportive, yet some do.
We consider the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system aims to provide a safe home, loving guardians, consistent education, and reliable healthcare.
The purpose of children's placement is to meet all the basic needs that they lacked in their previous homes.
In the internet, elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication are combined.
The special features of the internet imply additional dimensions in the case of the purpose theory of use.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as important effects of Internet use (James et al. 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "continuing relationships" as new affective factors when studying audience reactions to websites.
The use of videotapes has led to important findings in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Especially, it has been claimed that by interpreting micro expressions correctly, it is possible to identify if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks described in his article "The President's Speech" how people who are unable to comprehend speech due to brain injury are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
She even suggests that some animals, such as domestic dogs, may have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
The research of the 20th century has shown that there are two gene pools of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, selection removes it from the pool of variations that have appeared.
Differentiation and recombination transfer variation back and forth between these two pools with each generation.
Primates with a similar digestive system to humans have difficulty getting enough amino acids from the plants available on the savannah.
In addition, the consequences of not having them are serious: slow growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins obtained from leaves and legumes, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest them without cooking.
On the other hand, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is easily digestible, and also provides plentiful amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Therefore, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a somewhat similar way as the savannah chimpanzees do nowadays.
The interruption of sleep means intentional awakening during a normal sleep cycle and falling asleep again a little later (10-60 minutes later).
This can easily be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that restores consciousness without fully waking up.
If you find yourself turning off your alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternative options based on biorythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before bedtime, which may require getting up from bed to urinate.
The level of inner peace of a person corresponds inversely to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive his life force. It is possible for everyone to find perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it added the concept of Mahayana or the Great Path as well as many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of embracing universal love.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
Tibetan meditation center is god yoga. Visualizing deities purifies energy channels, activates chakras, and develops awareness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which is why the Soviet Union and the United States cooperated. After the war, clashes between systems, procedures, and cultures led to a rift between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies, leading to the Cold War.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and the war was fought for real, as proxy armies fought in the battlefields of Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
The Polish defense had already been broken by September 17, 1939, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead position.
These plans were, however, thwarted almost overnight, when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced into the country and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after attacking the eastern parts of Poland. This was in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, as well as other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional task of navies has been to ensure that their own country retains the ability to move its own people and goods, and at the same time disrupt the enemy's ability to move its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War. Americans attempted to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy mostly tried to block this traffic with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to easily obtain milk, fur, meat, and wool.
Domesticated goats were usually raised in herds that roamed hilly terrain or other pastures. Often they were cared for by goat herders, who were often children or young people, like the more well-known sheep herders. These herding methods are still in use today.
Carriages roads were already being built in England as early as the 1500s.
The wagon roads consisted solely of parallel wooden planks, but thanks to them, horses were able to pull wagons faster and with larger loads than on slightly uneven roads of the time.
The track sleepers were put into use quite early to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually understood that the rails would be more efficient if there was an iron strip on top of them.
The practice became common, but the iron wore down the wooden wheels of the wagons more.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first full iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. People began walking upright two million years ago when Homo erectus (or upright man) evolved.
The preceding Australopithecus did not walk upright as consistently.
Specialization in bipedalism can be found in the 4.2-3.9 million year old fossils of Australopithecus, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to reduce some of the future suffering.
This is often just like treating the symptoms of an illness, but if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the roots of the problems and eliminate them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind, and the problems have grown due to overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle of humanity.
After the Congress had approved it on July 4th, a handwritten copy signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
During the night, 150-200 copies were printed, which are now known as Dunlap broadsides.
John Nixon read the document out loud for the first time publicly in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of them was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who allowed it to be read to his troops in New York on July 9. One copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap open sheets known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many modern-day paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still living. We call them birds.
Many do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds have a lot of different characteristics that still look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
In practice, all currently used computers are based on processing data encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers - or in the professional language of computer circuits, bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made right away.
The surest sign of internal poisoning is a visible, open medication bottle or container containing toxic household chemicals.
Look at the first aid instructions for the poison in question on the label.
Entomologists use the term "true bugs" for this insect group.
The term derives from the fact that in the past, bed bugs have been very common. Bed bugs are insects that are very well adapted as parasites of humans.
Petroleum and bedbugs are both nest-dwelling, adapted to live in their host's nest or shelter.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis, also known as MS, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS disease affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS compared to men.
The couple can decide that raising a child is not in the best interest of themselves or their child.
These couples can, if they wish, create an adoption plan for their little one.
In adoption, biological parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to act as the child's parents.
The main task of science is to investigate, using scientific methods, how the world works. The scientific method guides most of scientific research.
However, it is not only about conducting experiments, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science were accepted, including in the field of psychology.
When the proficiency of the Greek language decreased in the West, it lost its connection to its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in body structure and behavior often depend very essentially on the existence of intrinsic cycles and their formation with the help of biological clocks.
Seasonal rhythms, which are not only reactions to external seasonal stimuli, have been observed in most living beings, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to operate freely for a certain period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's research was one of the most important pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to infect their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments either labeling the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorous or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have several different effects depending on the type of mutation, how important a part of the genetic code they have affected, and whether they have affected germ cells or other cells.
Only mutations occurring in germ cells can be inherited by children, and mutations occurring elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural destinations with the aim of enjoying the landscapes - including wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities in the travel destination include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits, and learning about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting the orangutans in Borneo, learning about them and taking photos of them.
Every morning the residents of small rural towns leave for work by car, and they encounter others whose workplace is where they themselves left from.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is somehow connected to a traffic system based on private cars and at the same time supports it.
Science now provides evidence that the enormous carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of the kind of stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everybody participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everybody complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause so many complaints, why do they fail daily? Are traffic planners just incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is a study that examines the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points as well as their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be anticipated with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the drivers behave relatively consistently. Thus, traffic flows usually have reasonably good consistency and can be presented roughly mathematically.
In order to better describe the flow of traffic, a relationship has been created between the following three main properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Understanding these relationships helps in the planning, design, and maintenance of road networks.
Insects were among the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage that they can fold their wings back against their body.
This way they have access to a wider selection of small places to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and damselflies are the only insects that are unable to fold their wings backwards.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the whole solar system moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, since the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, doesn't it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river in the world. It has over 8 times more water than the second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river in the world, reaching 6 miles at its widest point.
Twenty percent of the water flowing into the oceans on our planet comes from the Amazon.
The actual length of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It gathers water from thousands of smaller tributaries.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size or construction skill of the Giza pyramids was never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old at that time.
Vatican City's population is about 800. It is the world's smallest independent state and has the smallest population of any country.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communication.
The majority of those working in the government also speak Italian as their everyday language, but Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
"All residents of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics."
People have known common chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times, because they all occur in nature on their own and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is composed of a combination of one or more primary elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
It resembled more the four states of matter - solid, liquid, gas, and plasma in the same order - but he also theorized that they transform into other substances to form what we see.
Alloy are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
The elements, such as calcium and potassium, are counted as metals. There are, of course, also metals like gold and silver.
There are also metal alloys with small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so unbelievably small that trillions of them could fit into the ending period of this sentence.
So the pencil was indeed a good friend to many when it came to the market.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods develop, the value and purposes of the pencil have become more neglected.
Nowadays messages are written on the computer screen, and you never need to reach for a sharpener.
One can only guess what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb operates on the principle that it requires energy to form a core, composed of many protons and neutrons.
A little like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the core again releases another part of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which makes them prone to decay from a slight or nonexistent nudge.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called its crust.
The thickness of the moon's crust is about 70 kilometers on the side facing Earth and about 100 kilometers on the far side of the moon.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker on the highlands.
Dark oceanic areas may be more visible on the surface because the crust is thinner. Lava found it easier to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus primarily on examining what is behind people's behavior or what appeals to them.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they have grown up.
These theories examine why some people want what they want, and which factors in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory are popular content theories.
When leaders start to lead their former peers, generally two different behavior models can emerge. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
A leader like this has difficulty making unpopular decisions, maintaining discipline, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the scale, the person becomes unrecognizable, feeling that they must change everything the group has done and make it their own.
The leader is ultimately responsible for the successes and failures of the group.
Such behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are expected to have the same level of quality as traditional teams with slight differences.
Virtual team members act as the immediate contact person for their physical group.
They often have more decision-making power than ordinary team members, as their team members may meet according to different time zones and their local management may not always understand this.
The presence of a "real invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, 109) is also one of the unique components of a virtual team.
The Invisible Team is the leadership team to which all members report. The Invisible Team determines the level of requirements for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through a time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing systematic learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in all functioning departments of the organization, creativity and resourcefulness can emerge.
As a result, the process in which the organization works together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create an innovative culture and share information and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of consciousness. Therefore, it narrows the research area and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between neuropathology and behavior supports the researchers' study.
For a long time, it has been known that different brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The increasing emergence of new technologies provides the opportunity to see and study the structures and processes of the brain that have never been seen before.
This way we get a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes of our minds.
Although artificial intelligence is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of information technology that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The aim of artificial intelligence research is to make machines capable of automatically performing tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These have become specialized fields of study that focus on providing solutions to real problems.
Nowadays, artificial intelligence is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, technology, and national defense, just as it is built into many home computer and video game software applications.
Class trips are an important part of education. Often the teacher would like to take the students to places where you can't get by bus.
Technology offers a solution, that is, virtual field trips. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artwork while sitting at their desks.
Sharing the class trip virtually is an excellent way to reminisce and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. The website is updated annually, but its old versions are kept online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. In the early stages of students' blogging experience, grammar and spelling are often careless, but the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since the students themselves are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to make an effort to improve their writing and avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to understand the world around them better." The need to feed the readers' interest inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can give students the opportunity to be more analytical and critical. By actively responding to internet materials, students can define their position in relation to other people's writings and bring out their own perspective on the topic at hand" (Oravec 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital with a rich array of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and in the north there is, among other things, untouched, natural beauty of Muskoka.
These and many other factors create the impression of Ontario as a place that outsiders see as the epitome of Canada.
Large areas in the north are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
The following population comparison surprises many: There are more African Americans in the United States than there are citizens in Canada overall.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the coast of East Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the largest and, in terms of its nature, like its own continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or part of France, and they are known as luxurious beach destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it gained a lot of momentum in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 1400s, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area is bordered in the north by the Sahel and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women - All female travelers are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring also helps (as long as it doesn't look too valuable).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to behavior that they may perceive as harassment. It is not uncommon for someone to start following, grabbing an arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences don't make harassment acceptable!).
Casablanca's modern city was founded in the 9th century BCE by Berber fishermen, and it was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids, who called it Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name of Dar-ul-Badya, and Spanish merchants who established trading posts there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping destinations in Morocco.
It's easy to find places in the old medina selling traditional Moroccan products such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, water pipes, and a wide range of trinkets, but all of that is meant for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city on the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and buried most of its streets, especially in the city center.
Goma is reasonably safe, but all trips outside the city require prior investigation to determine the current status of the ongoing conflicts in the North-Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano. There you can also find the cheapest mountain gorilla trackers in Africa.
In Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) for getting around. The usual (local) fare is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
When this is combined with its relatively difficult location, "Timbuktu" has been used as a symbol of exotic, distant lands.
Currently, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
It was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites in 1990 due to the threat posed by the desert sand.
It was one of the most important stopping points in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special program Wonders of the African World.
The city is a stark contrast to the other cities in the country, as it has more of an Arab feel than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The surface area of the park is 19,500 km², and it is divided into 14 different nature areas, each of which supports different wildlife and native plants.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
In the park, a daily conservation and entrance fee is charged, as in all South African national parks.
It can be useful to also buy the Wild Card, which grants access to either some of South Africa's parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the Hong Kong area and is the main destination for many travelers.
The procession of buildings forming the silhouette of Hong Kong has been compared to a shimmering column diagram, best seen in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
You can see the best parts of Hong Kong by leaving the island and heading to the Kowloon waterfront area located across the harbor.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban area is located on densely filled land on the northern shore.
. This is the place that the British colonial masters took for themselves, and if you are looking for signs of the area's colonial history, this is a good place to start.
Sundarban is the world's largest mangrove forest area. It extends 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast to the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarban has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part located on the Indian side of the forest is called the Sundarban National Park.
Forests are not just mangrove swamps, but they include some of the last remnants of those magnificent jungles that once covered the entire Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which about a third is covered by water or marshland.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that there are currently 400 Indian tigers and approximately 30,000 axis deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, though most, especially those going east to Jakar and Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since the local buses in the area are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
In most districts, there are small Japanese Coaster buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long, and it has two lanes that are three and a half meters wide.
The underpass clearance height of the bridge is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the schedule, the bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, when it is estimated that the Brazilian border posts will be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group living in the area of present-day Eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
In the Chaco region, there were other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurús and the Payaguás, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of the Guaraní," was created as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the country's indigenous people in the 16th century.
The Spaniards began the colonial era, which lasted for three hundred years.
Paraguay has successfully maintained a large part of its original character and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen during other seasons.
The Argentine Polo Association provides news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is tied to the value of the pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged only at the islands' only bank, which is located in Stanley, opposite FIC West trade.
English sentence: British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outer islands, although currencies from the UK and the USA may be accepted. Check the accepted payment method by asking the owners in advance.
It is nearly impossible to change the currency of the Falkland Islands outside of the islands themselves, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it has summer when the northern hemisphere has winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone, and temperatures over 30 degrees are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes the air feel colder than the thermometer reading.
There are no specific rainy seasons and dry seasons: the amount of rain remains more or less the same throughout the year.
Although many park animals are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities instruct to stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from other wild animals.
Bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack, even though they may appear very gentle.
Every year dozens of visitors get injured because they did not keep a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Please also remember that strong scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or preparing strongly scented foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu, and its population is just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s, and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, a notorious naval standoff occurred in the harbor, when seven ships – German, American, and British – refused to leave the port.
All ships sank except for one British cruiser. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost in the process.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering held in the city led to the killing of high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many sandy beaches there because Auckland is located between two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three different areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches with safe swimming, and pohutukawa trees provide shade for most.
Tamaki Driven beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour in the affluent neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
They are sometimes crowded family beaches, and the shoreline is lined with a good selection of shops. Swimming is safe.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are several French wines worth trying, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but cautious people will easily find bottled water as well.
The idea of a flat white type of milky coffee is unfamiliar to Australians. A small black coffee is known as an espresso, and cappuccino is served with a large amount of frothed milk instead of steamed milk. Tea is served without milk.
The cocoa meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
There are many excursions to Riutta throughout the year, and injuries resulting from any of these reasons are rare at Riutta.
So pay attention to the authorities' advice, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cube jellyfish are found north of 1770 near shores and river estuaries from October to April. Occasionally, they can also be encountered at other times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and are likely to swim away from the area.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the sea, but their primary habitat is the river estuaries from Rockhampton to the north.
When booking in advance, the passenger can rest assured that they will have some sleeping accommodation upon reaching their destination.
Travel agencies often have special offers for certain hotels, but it may also be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through the travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport arrangements to and from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep your reservation valid if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your purchase (e.g. visa).
All changes and requests should be directed through the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on the premises, and most participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the events, you need to arrive on time to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even after the main stage music performances have ended, there may still be places at the festival where music continues to be played late into the night.
Some festivals have separate camping areas for families with children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea during winter, check the location of the cabin, because the sound of ice breaking can be quite terrifying in the worst areas.
St. Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos typically try their best to maximize the time and money spent by customers. There are usually no windows or clocks, and finding exits can be difficult.
They often have special food, drink, and entertainment offers to keep customers in a good mood – and within the casino premises.
Some places offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication impairs judgement, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Those who plan to drive at high latitudes or mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or extremely cold temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction, and you cannot drive the same way as you would on asphalt.
During a snowstorm, snow can fall in a very short time to an extent that a car gets stuck.
Snowfall or blowing snow in the wind and moisture or ice accumulated on the vehicle's windows may also impair visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and transportation usually operates year-round without interruptions.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest draw of Africa and the highlight of the visit for many.
In popular terms, the word safari refers to traveling by land, with the purpose of observing Africa's amazing wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and ordinary equipment is sufficient for watching them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as bushwalking, hiking safari, and trekking) refers to either a few hours or several days of hiking.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24th August to 5th September 2021. Some events will be held in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it served as the host of the 1964 games.
If you booked your flight or accommodation for the year 2020 before the postponement was announced, your situation may be difficult.
Cancellation policies vary, but based on the situation at the end of March, most of the coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were supposed to be held.
Most events' tickets are expected to cost 2,500-130,000 yen, with tickets typically costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them to dry. Many hotels offer the possibility to borrow an iron and ironing board, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron available or if you don't particularly care about ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric heat too much (because it can cause shrinking or in extreme cases, scorching).
There are various ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, while in other areas several minutes are needed.
The efficiency of filters varies, and if you have doubts, it is worth considering purchasing water from a reputable company in sealed bottles.
Travelers can encounter pests that they are not used to in their home region.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, allergic reactions, spread poison and transmit diseases.
Actual contagious diseases or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people violently are not usually considered as pests.
Tax-free purchases mean the possibility to buy products in certain places that are exempt from manufacturing and sales taxes.
Travelers heading to countries with heavy taxation may sometimes save significant amounts of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway, as it repeatedly travels through remote forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: there are a lot of steep ascents and descents, narrow driving lanes, and sharp turns ahead.
The specified speed limits are significantly lower than on earlier and later stretches - usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour) - and their strict observance is even more important than usual.
Oddly enough, the mobile phone coverage is much better here than in many other places along the way, like the Pennsylvania Wilds area.
German pastries are very good and in Bavaria quite hearty and versatile, reminiscent of the pastries of its southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are common. Apple pastries are made year-round, and cherries and plums are popular fillings in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often taste especially good with a strong cup of coffee.
If you crave small but sturdy pastries, try one called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, either with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland areas of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry. In South India and in some other peninsula coastal areas, coconut milk is commonly used.
Since there are 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a broad concept that covers a wide range of regional food cultures across the country.
But if the term is used without additional specifications, it usually refers to the food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the entire archipelago, offering a wide range of simply flavored dishes. Javanese favorite flavors include peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the rider's foot supports, hanging on both sides of the saddle.
The rider gains more stability from them, but they may also raise safety concerns, as the rider's legs may become entangled in them.
If the rider falls from the horse's back, but the foot gets stuck in the stirrup, the runaway horse may end up dragging them along. Various precautionary measures can be taken to reduce this risk.
First of all, most riders use high-heeled riding boots, which have a smooth and rather narrow sole.
In some saddles, especially English ones, there is a safety bar that allows the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if the falling rider pulls it backwards.
Cochamón valley - Chile's number one climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America. The valley features various large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer breathtaking views. Climbers from around the world continuously create new routes on its endless walls.
Skiing sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which one descends snowy terrain on skis or with a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important tourist activity, and many enthusiasts, sometimes referred to as ski bums, plan entire holidays around skiing in a specific location.
Skiing as a concept is very old - ski symbols have been made already in 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 1600s, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first leisure ski center in Australia.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also called ski touring, ski trekking or expedition skiing.
It is akin to alpine skiing-style hiking or mountain climbing, but it generally does not include that, as the latter is practiced in steep terrain, and it requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the skiing route as a similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can progress somewhat faster than on foot, but you very rarely reach the same speed as when skiing on maintained trails and without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but there are many independent countries there. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean filling out visa applications and passing passport controls many times.
The Schengen Area operates in this respect somewhat like a single state.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
When you have a Schengen visa, you also do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member state separately, thus saving time, money, and the hassle of paperwork.
There is no universal definition for what factory-made goods qualify as antiques. Some tax authorities define all goods over a hundred years old as antiques.
The definition varies depending on geographical location. For example, in North America, newer objects are considered antique compared to Europe.
Craft products may be defined as antiques even if they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sámi, and the related culture is also important for many other professionals.
Even traditionally, not all Saami people have participated in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but have lived from fishing, hunting and similar livelihoods and mainly kept reindeer as draught animals.
Currently, many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi.
Although the word "gypsy" is widely used especially by non-Roma people, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.
If your destination is subject to a travel advisory, it may affect your travel medical insurance and trip cancellation insurance.
Maybe it's worth asking for advice from other countries in addition to your own, even though their advice is for their own citizens.
As an example, Americans may find themselves in different situations in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
The announcements are only short summaries of the political situation in a certain country.
The presented views are often superficial, generalized, and too simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Dangerous weather is a generic term for all dangerous weather phenomena that may cause damage, serious societal disruptions, or loss of life.
Dangerous weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hailstorms, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are forms and consequences of dangerous weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Dangerous weather includes regional and seasonal phenomena such as snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Passengers are strongly recommended to be aware of the threat of hazardous weather affecting their travel destination, as it may impact travel plans.
All those who want to visit a country that is interpreted as a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search with the term "Hostile Environment Course" will likely yield the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the topics discussed here in much more detail and usually combined with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2-5 days and includes role playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few and far between.
Travelers planning to have gender confirmation surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of authorities to issue passports with no gender marker (X) or update documents to match desired name and gender varies.
Foreign authorities' willingness to respect these documents varies just as much.
Security checks have also become much more invasive since September 11, 2001.
Non-surgically transitioned transgender individuals should not expect to pass through security scanners while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Return currents are the returning flow of waves breaking on the shore. They are often found on reefs or similar locations.
Because of the underwater surface formations, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper areas, and there can be a rapid flow into deep water.
Most deaths result from exhaustion when trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be swept away by the current again, or depending on your skills and whether you have been noticed, it may be wise to wait for rescuers.
The return shock strikes earlier than culture shock (the adaptation phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Tourists who found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes have a particularly difficult time readjusting to their own home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of your home culture's habits.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
People may not understand that patience and understanding are also important for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
The pyramids can be seen in the dark, and before the show starts they can be seen in complete silence.
Usually one always hears the voices of travelers and vendors. The story of light and sound is like a fairy tale book.
The Sphinx is the background of a long story and its narrator.
Scenes are presented against pyramids, and different pyramids are lit up.
Many states have claimed the Southern Shetland Islands for themselves, which were discovered in 1819, and indeed have the most bases there. In 2020, there were sixteen active bases.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest is King George's Island, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, where the water-filled crater of a still active volcano serves as a stunning natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is an area south of the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plain there and then rise again to form the 360-kilometer long Ellsworth Mountains, which are divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, on the Sentinel Mountains, are located the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4,892 meters.
In remote areas where mobile phones have no coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a replacement for a mobile phone, because in order to make a call, you have to be outside and maintain unobstructed visibility to the satellite.
The service is often used in maritime, as well as with pleasure yachts. Similarly, it is used by expeditions that need data and voice connections from a distance.
The local phone service provider is probably able to provide further information on connecting to the respective service.
Traveling and learning is becoming an increasingly popular option among those planning a gap year.
It is especially popular among high school graduates, because they can take a gap year before university without their education suffering.
In many cases, participating in a gap year course abroad can even improve the chances of continuing higher education in one's own country.
Typically, participation in these instructional programs incurs a course fee.
Finland is an excellent boating destination. In the land of thousands of lakes, there are also thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the archipelagos along the coastline.
In archipelagos and lakes, you may not necessarily need a boat the size of a ferry.
Even though the archipelagos of the coast and the largest lakes are large enough for any boats, smaller boats or even kayaks provide a different experience.
Boating is a common recreational activity in Finland, where there is one boat for every seventh or eighth person.
The ratio is the same as in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise very rare (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most actual Baltic Sea cruises include a longer visit to St. Petersburg.
This means that you can visit the historical city for a few days and still return to the ship to sleep at night.
You do not need a separate visa if you only visit countries on excursions organized by the ship (as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures include Germany's Berlin. As shown in the map above, Berlin is not anywhere near the sea, so a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or experienced something traumatic.
There is no reason to be ashamed: it does not differ from many other people's fears and disgust towards some other things.
In some cases, having some understanding of how the airplane operates and what happens during the flight may help overcome the fear caused by ignorance or feelings of helplessness.
Transport companies are paid well for fast deliveries. Often, speed is very important for the documents, merchandise, or spare parts needed for urgent repair work for businesses.
Larger companies have their own airplanes on some routes, but on other routes and with smaller companies there was a problem.
If they sent goods by air freight, the unloading and customs clearance of the freight could take days on some routes.
The only way to get the merchandise through faster was to send it as registered baggage. Airline regulations do not allow the shipment of baggage without a passenger, so we need you at this stage.
A self-evident way to fly in first or business class is to pay a large bundle of money for this privilege (or perhaps prefer to have your company do it for you).
It doesn't, however, come cheap: according to a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the price for business class compared to economy class, and eleven times the price for first class!
It's generally not worth even looking for discounts on business class or first class seats on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines know that there is a certain core group of air travelers who are willing to pay a lot to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
The conflict led to the declaration of independence of the Republic of Transnistria in 1994, located in Eastern Moldova. It has its own government and currency, but no member of the UN recognizes it.
There has been a renewed economic ties between these two parts of Moldova, even though political negotiations have failed.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
In izmir, the population is about 3.7 million, it is the second largest port in the country after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling center of trade, surrounded by mountains and spreading around a vast bay.
Among wide boulevards, glass-surfaced buildings, and modern shopping centers, there are traditional red brick roofs, an 18th-century market square, and old mosques and churches, even though the atmosphere of the city is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
In Haldarsvík there is an unusual octagonal church, and the village offers a view of the nearby Eysturoy island.
The churchyard has interesting dove sculptures on top of some tombstones.
It is worth spending half an hour walking around the fascinating village.
To the north and easily accessible is the romantic and captivating city of Sintra. Foreigners got to know it from the praising description written by Lord Byron, where he described its splendor.
The bus line 403 from ScottUrbin runs regularly to Sintra and makes a stop at Cabo da Rocassa.
In the northern direction, it is also worth visiting the large sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, which is globally famous for the apparition of Mary.
Remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave and a site whose significance to a significant portion of the earth's population is almost immeasurably significant.
There are still many men and women who survived being there, and many others whose loved ones were killed there or forced to work themselves to death, both Jews and non-Jews alike.
Remember to treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Don't ruin the place by drawing or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the majority understands it, and practically everyone can speak Spanish.
Most signs, however, are marked only in Catalan, as it is the first official language according to the law.
However, Spanish is commonly used in public transport and other services as well.
The regular announcements on the metro are only in Catalan, but the automatic system notifies of unexpected disruptions in many different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant people.
Even though it is often just a misleading stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to behave as decently as possible and act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It makes getting around much easier.
The rude exterior of Parisians quickly fades if you show just ordinary politeness.
In Plitvice Lakes National Park, there is a lot of forest, mainly beech, spruce, and pine trees, and its vegetation is a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean plants.
There is a remarkably wide range of plant communities due to various microclimates, varying soils, and differences in elevation.
In the area, there are also an extraordinarily large number of different animal and bird species.
In addition to more common species, you can encounter rare wildlife such as bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats, and grouse.
Women visiting the monasteries must wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
But if you bring your own scarf, especially a brightly colored one, you might get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Likewise, men need to wear trousers that reach below the knee.
Those can also be borrowed from the entrance wardrobe, but they are not washed after every use, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts. One size fits all men!
The Mallorcan kitchen is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) in a similar way to kitchens of other Mediterranean zones and uses olive oil for everything.
A simple popular dinner, especially in the summer, is pa amb oli: bread with olive oil and tomato, and any available accompaniments such as cheese or tuna.
All nouns, and in addition, the word "Sie" meaning "you" always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs from objects.
It can also make reading easier, although it complicates writing the need to clarify whether the verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy because most words are pronounced just as they are written.
The letters C and G should be paid the most attention to, as their pronunciation depends on the following vowel.
Remember also to pronounce the r and rr differently. Caro means love, carro means wagons.
Persian grammar is fairly easy and mostly regular.
Reading this grammar book would help in learning many aspects of Persian grammar and improve understanding of sentences.
It goes without saying that if you know some Romance language, learning Portuguese is easier.
However, those who speak a little Spanish may initially imagine that Portuguese is so close that it does not need to be studied separately.
Nowadays, old-fashioned observatories are not generally used for their original purpose, but they have been converted into museums or learning environments.
Since light pollution was not the same problem in their glory days as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, and are easier to access than the ones built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities located in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
Viewing cherry blossoms, also known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea was obtained from China, where the most popular flower was Japanese apricot.
In Japan, the emperor organized the first cherry blossom festival only for himself and for members of the aristocracy in the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just one" as a sample.
If you visit an official and well-maintained garden, you will be kicked out for collecting "samples" without any buts.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay, and it is very easy to find your way around. You can buy almost anything after arrival.
But being in the heart of the tropics just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to endure both heat (always) and strong sunshine (when the sky is clear, which happens less often).
In addition, a few buses go north to Hebron, traditionally to the burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are planning to board also goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Kiryat Arba Jewish settlement.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to plan a vacation around.
For example, visiting the castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or cruising to interesting cities along the Danube River, or boating in the canals of Venice.
They also determine the course of popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important religious holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers and non-Christians in Christian countries and around the world have also adopted many holiday-related traditions.
According to tradition, Easter night is spent awake in an open place to see the sunrise.
This tradition naturally has Christian theological explanations, but it could well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
The more traditional churches often hold an Easter night mass on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend. The congregation often bursts into celebration at the moment of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the island came there by swimming, flying, or floating.
Since the mainland was very far away, mammals were unable to survive the journey, so the giant tortoise became the main grass-eating animal on the Galapagos Islands.
After humans arrived to the Galapagos Islands, many mammals including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs were brought there.
If you visit the Arctic or the Antarctic in the winter, you will experience polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, because the sky is dark for nearly 24 hours.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not a problem, you can also admire the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners may be accustomed to.
Suits are a common work outfit, and colleagues address each other by their last name or title.
Harmony in the workplace is absolutely essential. Instead of personal achievements, teamwork is emphasized.
Employees often need to get their supervisor's approval for all decisions they make, and they are expected to follow their supervisor's instructions without question.
