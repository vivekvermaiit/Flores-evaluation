This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely accepted, but it provides details that fossils usually do not provide, such as the color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top with a pale carrot color on the bottom.
The discovery also provides clues on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but had other feather features such as barbs and barbules, researchers have thought that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development compared to the other features.
The feather structure suggests that it was not used for flying but rather to regulate temperature or for display. Researchers have suggested that even though this is the skin of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows feathers from an adult and not the scales of a hatchling.
The experts have suggested that even though this is the bone of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows signs of being an adult and not that of a hatchling.

Four skiers in the women's group did not finish the race, and 45 out of 117 total skiers in the giant slalom did not manage to qualify in the race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh has recovered the stolen computer and phone.
The Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who have violently attacked the female tourist and recovered her phone and computer."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
Even though there were three people inside the house when the car crashed, no one got hurt.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was closed for a while while the emergency services pulled the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After being taken to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since that moment, Adekoya has been in the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh accused of hitting his son.
She is in custody awaiting trial and process, but any testimonial evidence could be contaminated because her image has been made so public.
This is something that often happens in the United Kingdom, but justice in Scotland works differently and the courts have seen that publishing photos can be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee says, "Journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line by publishing photos, etc. of suspects."
The General Secretariat of the Crown, responsible for managing the proceedings, told journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the trial is postponed.
According to the leaked information, the document will refer to the dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Six-Day War.
The discussed topics are the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands continuous military presence in the valley for at least ten years every time an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees that this presence should only be for five years.
Those who participated in the additional disinfection test had to be well supervised by the rangers, while the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In association with the NPWS, the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, has taken on qualified volunteers under the shooting association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the current director of Park Conservation and Heritage of NPWS, the four selected shooters for the first shooting operation received safety instructions and complete training.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in as a member of the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of nine people.
It's the fifth CEP of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to bring the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that erupted in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, have arisen from the fact that there have been no elections, some of which were supposed to have been held since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of overheating iPod malfunctions, which have caused seven fires and resulted in four people suffering minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan has said that they are aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI said that Apple had been informed of another 34 overheating incidents that the company defined as "not serious".
The ministry responded, saying that the delay in the Apple relationship is "truly regrettable".
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT yesterday).
The emergency office of the Northern Mariana Islands has said that there have been no damages in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has also mentioned that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been saved and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
The hostages, including children and the elderly, have been released together with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady who needed the bathroom. Mendoza was furious.
He continued in the footsteps of his father and began a career in medicine.
He studied to be a nurse and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins started studying premature birth in his free time.
The research has shown that if a hormone is given, it would accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua said that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two "black boxes" from the flight recorders.
Even the rowing colleagues paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the Queen of the Extreme. She was my first manager. Luna passed away last night of the two moons. A unique thing just like her. Strong woman.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented saying that "Luna was killed like me... maybe even more... I love her and I miss her... hoping that she is in a better place."
1400 people were interviewed before the federal elections of 2010, and those who do not want Australia to become a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim prime minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the federal elections of 2010 that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those who participated in the survey agree with this idea and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the survey, 29 percent of those interviewed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100 and 200 meter freestyle events and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaints, her health has been put in doubt.
It is not good to take the same medicine to overcome their pain because it is prohibited by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25th, found the largest known prime number.
Many people have reported the police using different tools and programs since the beginning of February and it was communicated on Tuesday.
The comets could bring water to Earth along with organic matter that forms proteins and supports life.
The scientists hope to understand how the planets are formed, in particular how the Earth was formed, given that comets struck the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, ended his term as governor at the beginning of the year and last month signed a law making same-sex marriage legal.
You told me that it is "politics of lies and manipulation".
I said that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow airplanes to fly with shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel every year while reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
They used a satellite technology different from the old radar-based technology on the ground that allows air traffic controllers to target aircraft more precisely and give pilots more precise information.
No extraordinary transport has been put into operation and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and the parking and interchange parking lots are not available on the ground.
The fear of few transports has made the possibility of the match being played behind closed doors without the fans of the team.
One study published in the journal Science addresses the discovery of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
The scholars at Princeton University in the United States and at Uppsala University in Sweden have stated that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it is believed that this process will last much longer, due to the crosses between the endemic species of Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the migrating finch of the cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
The gold can be worked in all forms. It can also be molded into small shapes.
You can be drawn like a thin thread that can be wound and unraveled. You can be beaten or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and laid on other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-made figures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator with the juice of red cabbage.
The color of the cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical substance is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the pH of pH) present in the substance being examined.
The hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since the hydrogen atom is made up of one proton and one electron).
I mix the two powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, knead it to make a ball.
The dampness on your hands will interact with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a sort of film.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have a cabinet in almost every house connected to a complex sewer system.
The remains of the sewers were found in the ancient city of Knossos in Crete and in Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, the toilets were sometimes part of the buildings of public baths where men and women went together.
When someone from so far away calls you, you need to use a satellite.
The satellite in space picks up the call and sends it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere bends the light and our vision.
They need a rocket over 100 feet tall to put a satellite or a telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing that the wheel has done for us is to give us a more comfortable and faster means of transportation.
He brought the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them there are medium-sized felines that prey on medium-sized animals such as rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Finally there are many small felines (including house cats) that eat many more small animals like insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret of his success is the niche concept, a special place that has every feature and keeps it away from competition with others.
The lions are the most social of the felines, they live in large groups called prides.
The herds are made up of one to three adult males in competition and up to thirty females and young.
The women are usually closely related to each other, it is a large family of sisters and daughters.
The herds of lions are a family like the herds of wolves or dogs, incredibly similar animals to lions (but not to other felines) in behavior, and equally deadly to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (even if not well), swim, make great leaps and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but more like a string of harsh, jagged words.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals. It catches monkeys, coatis, mice and birds if it can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are smaller than it.
The scientists believe that the ocelot follows and finds prey with its sense of smell, sensing the ground where they have been.
I can see very well in the dark with night vision, and it moves also silently. The ocelot hunts its prey by blending in with the environment and then pouncing on it.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from where it came (such as if it moves beyond a mountain or river, or if it moves to a new island in a way that it is not easy to return) it will often find itself in a different environment than where it was before.
This new environment has many resources and many competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what was needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they need the same adjustments as before.
As the new population starts to adapt to the new environment, they start to resemble less and less to the other population.
Finally, after hundreds and even thousands of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We are talking about this special process, which practically means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., they take it out).
The plants feed from the sun through photosynthesis. And they also create shade.
We build our houses with plants, and our clothes with plants. Much of what we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
The mosasaur was the strongest predator of its time, it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
In his mouth, he had more than 70 sharp teeth like razors, and another time there was one on the palate, there was no escape for anyone who was caught.
We are not sure but he might have had a forked tongue. He ate turtles, fish, other mosasaurs and maybe he was also a cannibal.
The sea would swallow up anything that entered it; even a beast like a T.rex would have met a bad end.
Even if many of their dishes may seem normal, the Romans had a habit of eating strange or unusual things like wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of squirrel called a dormouse.
The only difference was that while the poor and the women ate sitting on stools, the gentlemen also feasted together reclining on their sides while eating.
The food of the ancient Romans could not have the ingredients to eat that had arrived in Europe from America or Asia in the centuries after.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate chocolate.
The Babylonians, for all their divinities, built a primary temple that was the house of the god.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests in order to meet the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had a green courtyard and a inner sanctuary where only the priest could enter.
Sometimes special towers in the shape of pyramids called ziggurats were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was the sanctuary of the god.
In the mild climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Great part of the life of a Jewish family was outside.
The women used to cook in the courtyard; the shops were only benches along the street. The houses were made of stone.
There was no large forest on the land of Canaan, so the wood cost a lot.
In Greenland lived few people. The Norwegian sailor Erik the Red had been sent into exile from Iceland because he had killed someone, and while traveling to the west he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But even though he made his discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Even if every country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film National Treasure, you might think that there is a treasure map written behind the Declaration of Independence.
But it's not true. Even if there is something written behind the document, it's not a treasure map.
From behind the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776." These words can be seen at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Even if no one knows who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning this large document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be put away.
So it's likely that this note has been attached as a label.
The landings of D-Day and the ensuing battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by the Vichy France. These were French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and they worked for the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies had invaded the south of France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just seven weeks the Americans and possibly the Free French forces had liberated southern France and were moving towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared among a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means civil, in relation to the Latin "civis," which means citizen, and "civitas," which means city or city-state, and in some way defines the greatness of society.
The city-state is the ancestor of nations. A culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through the generations, a cultural footprint that endures and a just diffusion.
Culture smaller often disappears without leaving important historical traces and cannot be recognized as true civilization.
During the War of Revolution the thirteen states at the beginning formed a weak central government, with the Congress as the only component, under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to demand taxes and, since there was no executive or national judiciary, to enforce all its laws it relied on the authorities of the state that often did not collaborate.
They did not even have the authority to annul fiscal laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles demand unanimous consent from all the states before being modified, and the states have taken the central government with such carelessness that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is tied with the German national football team as the second team to have won the most World Cups and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
The popular sports are soccer, basketball, volleyball, swimming, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, field hockey, and Formula One races.
Winter sports are famous mainly in the North regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu) which makes Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the clusters of islands it has, Japan is often referred to from a geographical point of view as an "archipelago."
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by called the island Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the East India Company established a base in the southeastern part of Taiwan, aiming to change the indigenous practices of wheat production and employing Chinese laborers in the rice paddies and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western part and the northern coasts of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the first Sino-Japanese war (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which gave control of Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made of three main structures called Intihuatanam, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The majority of buildings at the edges of the complex have been reconstructed so that tourists can get a better idea of how they used to be.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been renovated and the restoration work is still ongoing.
For example, the most common fixed image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the excellent film format at the end of the analog film era.
The thing has been done again, but the most important thing is that their aspect ratio has been inherited from the formats of image sensors of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the ratio as a simpler whole number) is consequently called 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format group) are similar or closely related to this aspect ratio.
The much abused and often criticized rule of thirds is a simple guideline that maintains dynamism while keeping a sense of order in the image.
The best place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the powerful and wealthy Catholic Church was under examination.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has held together the European states despite the differences in language and customs.
His power reached everyone, from kings to peasants.
One of the main teachings of Christians is that kindness should be used to alleviate suffering and misery and that the wealth of the household is there for this reason.
The control center of the house has been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and all this power and money have made many question whether the doctrine has been respected.
Shortly after the beginning of hostilities, the English made a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy aimed at success, cutting essential civilian and military supports, even if this blockade was a violation of a generally accepted international law, codified by many international agreements in the centuries before.
Great Britain has put mines in international waters to block entire parts of the ocean to all ships, causing damage even to neutral ships.
Since there was little to do against this tactic, Germany expected a response similar to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude of almost all citizens and countries was one of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, nations wanted to avoid another similar thing in the future.
In 1884 Tesla went to the United States of America to work with the Edison company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States without money, with a book of poems and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) for Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of showing the various periods of the year: every phase of China or every family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, between each dynasty there was a calm period with divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was that of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there were terrible wars among the various nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in battles to claim the highest position in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric decimal system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single sovereign.
Even after the Revolution and the occupation, there were opportunities for all candidates, allowing the most ambitious ones to achieve success.
The same is valid for the military because instead of classifying the army based on class, from this was based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in issues that went beyond this worldly life. He frequented a cave that became famous as "Hira'" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The same cave, survived through time, offers a very vivid image of the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
The inn on top of a mountain north of Mecca is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find it even though she knew it existed. Once inside the cave, there is total isolation.
You can see nothing but the clear and beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" near the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, has many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the most imposing), several small tombs, various temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was being built to honor the pharaoh Cheops and many other pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor the women and members of Cheops' family.
The "high arc" sign looks like a V and the "low arc" sign like a graph or a square without the lower side.
You should stop pushing the bow away, and now you should release the grip (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An arch high usually produces a softer sound, while an arch low usually a stronger and more decisive sound.
Feel free to write your notes in pencil, but remember that printed music signs are there for a musical reason so they should usually be respected.
The terrorized King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Maria Teresa and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Elizabeth, were forced by a crowd of market women to return to Paris on October 6, 1789 at Versailles.
I returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were insulting and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to keep the windows of the carriage open.
At a certain point, someone foolishly showed the head of a real guard beheaded at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The expenses of the American imperialism war for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
I was forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States in order to cover the majority of expenses and interest on their changing obligations in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Naturally, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people had constituted the fundamental conquests of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The middle phase of the Middle Ages came after the early phase of the High Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
The technological determinism has so many ideas, from technological drive or technological imperative to the narrow sense that human destiny is guided by a basic logic along with scientific laws and their manifestation into technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two ideas: the development of technology itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, technology has "effects" on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the car engine contributes to the development of roads.
However, a network of national roads is not economically vital only for some machines, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a machine.
Having so many cars also leads to many accidents on its roads, and this leads to the invention of new medical techniques to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism had a great cultural deterministic element in the writings of authors like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures linked to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with society, turned out to be better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known to be the fashion capital, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known for being a center of luxury from the 400s to the 1100s.
The twelfth century is considered significant above all because the Crusaders had returned with their knowledge and experiences, which were considered more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
In this period, the title of Capital of Luxury has passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of the Byzantine East.
Nevertheless, due to slow communication channels, Western styles could have remained behind for 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time was that, following the crusades, people began to use buttons on their clothes.
subsistence agriculture is the agriculture aimed at producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
The subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often biological, which uses saved seeds native to the region combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, the majority of farmers have been involved in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
The subculture brings together individuals who think the same way, feel neglected by societal standards, and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
The subcultures can be distinguished based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The quality that determines a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or generated by a specific combination of factors.
The members of a subculture often indicate their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and speech.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to reach out to the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, abandonment or deliberate abuse, have not been supported from a social standpoint by adults during their upbringing.
The boys are called "selvareghi". Some of them have been confined by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the parents' refusal to accept a serious intellectual or physical disability in the child.
The poor children could have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or before being left alone.
If one thinks that others are drawn from animals; it is said that some have lived in the wild state.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, the child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) that are almost entirely similar to those of the animal that raised it, such as its fear or its indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a step further.
The one that is defined as scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a support that provides assistance to people who are about to face a new learning experience such as the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
The teaching tool called scaffold can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teaching tool is a form of scaffold, but it is also the little man of the graphic in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolding is incorporated into the software and has the purpose of putting into discussion, suggesting, and explaining procedures that may be difficult to manage for each individual student.
The children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from abandonment, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not supportive, caring, and educational, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safety for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare assistance.
The foster care should provide all the necessary things missing in the previous home of the children who were taken there previously.
Internet unites elements of interpersonal and mass communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet have already brought other dimensions of use and approach to gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James and others 1995).
"Involvement of the person" and "continuous relationships" have been identified as motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating the public's reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has brought important advancements in the interpretation of microexpressions and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that one can understand a person well by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," indicated that people who are unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are still able to accurately gauge someone's sincerity.
The ability to interpret human behavior can also be shared by animals such as dogs.
The research of the 20th century has shown that there are two basins of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The constant mutation brings a new genetic variation and removes the old variation from the pool expressed.
The segregation and recombination mix the variation forward and backward between the two pools at each generation.
The savanna is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino acid needs by relying on available plant resources.
Also the impossibility of doing so can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The vegetable resources most easily accessible would be the proteins found in their leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest unless cooked.
On the contrary, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that the savannah chimpanzees do now.
The interruption of sleep is the process of waking up abruptly during the normal period of sleep and falling asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively gentle method to bring you back to a conscious state without fully waking you up.
If you close your eyes to rest while you sleep, the pillow can be positioned on the other side of the bed, forcing you to get up to adjust it.
Another option based on the biorhythm involves consuming a lot of liquids (in particular water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before sleeping, forcing one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that characterizes a person is related to the amount of tension present in the body and in the spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force present. Each person has the potential to find inner peace and absolute fulfillment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has spread through the path of Mahayana love and through many techniques typical of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through the yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Divinity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of illumination takes shape.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, leading the USSR and the United States to collaborate. The end of the war and the clashes of systems, processes, and cultures caused the decline of the nations.
Two years after the end of the war, the allies were now enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It would go on for the next 40 years and would be fought for real by the proxy armies and their battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been dismantled and the only hope remained was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian outpost.
However, these plans had already become obsolete almost from yesterday to tomorrow when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union faced the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The purpose of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that the nation maintains the ability to move its own people and goods while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the recent examples of this noteworthy phenomenon was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time the navy, which mainly used U-Boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have been able to conquer England as it had done with the rest of Europe.
It seems that the domestication of horses first occurred around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes used to keep them for milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Housewives were usually taking care of the household while the husband went around the hills or other grazing areas, often guided by dogs that were often barking and jumping, similar to the more well-known shepherds. These pastoral ways are still used today.
The carriages had already been built in England in the 16th century.
Even if the wagons were only made of wooden planks placed one next to the other, they allowed the horses pulling them to go faster and carry heavier loads compared to the completely destroyed roads of the time.
The track had been almost immediately put in position, but at one point it was understood that the tracks would have been better with a layer of iron on top.
This has become a common practice, but it damages the iron and wooden wheels of the wagons.
In the end, the wooden wheel was replaced with an iron wheel. In 1767, the first railway entirely made of iron had been built.
The first means of transportation was walking, people started walking on two feet millions of years ago when Homo Erectus (which means upright man) emerged.
Those who used to walk on all fours, the Australopithecus, usually did not walk upright.
The bipedal characteristic was found in the fossils of australopithecines from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, even though Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live better together with the environment, we can join environmental movements, and we can also become more active in searching for ways to reduce future suffering.
In many cases this is like treating the symptoms. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, now we need to find the root of the problems and solve them.
It's quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and the problems have become even bigger due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten and signed copy by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's print shop.
During the night, they made between 150 and 200 copies of the known as "Dunlap flyers".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
A letter was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his soldiers in New York on July 9. A copy was received in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap flyers that are known to still exist are the oldest copies of this document. The original hand-written copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists still believe a group of dinosaurs escaped and is still alive today. We call them birds.
So many people don't think they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are so many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scales and joints, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Practically all of today's computers rely on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number has only one of two values, for example 0 or 1, and these numbers are indicated by binary digits, or bits, to use in computer jargon.
The internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms such as vomiting are quite general enough to make an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of a green medicine bottle or toxic chemical products in the house.
Control the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "paroła zimeso" is commonly used by entomologists to refer to this group of insects.
The familiarity with lice infestations indicates an ancient relationship with humans.
The winter linens and the bed linens are inexpensive, suitable for living in a guest room or in the guest's house.
In all of the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which is the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
The multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Researcher have seen that women have twice as much possibility of getting MS compared to men.
A couple can decide that having a child is not in their best interest, or in the child's best interest.
These two can decide to try to adopt a child.
The termination of the rights of the natural parents occurs so that another couple can parent the child.
The main goal of science is to understand with the scientific method how the world works. This method in fact guides almost all scientific discoveries.
However, it is not only experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, also questions and observations guide scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers were focused on classical texts, and in particular, the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas on all matters of science, including psychology, were very influential.
Once Western knowledge of Greek started to decline, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production of biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue for a period of free cycling even without external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main evidence that DNA is made of genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
I have conducted two experiments by marking the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
The mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the touched genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ line cells.
Only mutations in the germ line cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations from other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism based on its nature appeals to people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including the fauna and flora.
Examples of activities to do on site are hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information on the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and getting to know the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave in their cars from the countryside villages to go to work and are passed by others who are also going to work where they are sad to leave.
In this transport system, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
The prompt is in Venetian and can be translated to English as: The abrupt shift in carbon economy has moved the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the means of transportation. Almost everyone complains about the means of transportation.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear complaints about the quality of the water or the condition of the bridges.
Why do the means of transportation bring out so many complaints, because they have problems every day? Don't the transportation engineers understand anything? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
The flow of traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of those who drive cannot be predicted with complete certainty.
Fortunately, those who drive tend to behave within a reasonably coherent limit; thus, the traffic currents tend to have a reasonable coherence and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, the relationship between the three main characteristics has been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
The relationship gives a hand in planning, designing, and in the functioning of road structures.
The insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to escape from enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings behind their body.
This gives the possibility to hide from predators in many small places.
Even the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the butterfly and the mayfly.
A few years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some thought that he was right but others thought the opposite, that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and also other stars).
This seems like a sensible thing, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It has more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river, in some points it is half as wide.
About 20 percent of the water from rivers that flows into the planet's oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It gathers water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of stone pyramids has advanced until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza have never been surpassed in size and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which at the time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the fewest inhabitants.
The Vatican City uses Italian as its official language for legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the common language used by almost everyone who works in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of the City of Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because these could be found in nature in authentic form and were relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it is also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
The elements are practically a mix of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
The elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Obviously, there are also metals like gold and silver.
There is also a small amount of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The whole Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so small that millions of them could fit at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil has been a good friend to many people when it has come out.
Unfortunately, with the arrival of newer writing methods, the use of pencils has decreased.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens, they don't need a pen and paper.
One can wonder what will become of the keyboard once new technology comes out.
The nuclear bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Once you know how to push a heavy cart up a hill. The core's session allows a portion of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no force.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is more delicate under the seas and thicker under the plateaus.
There might be some seas on the nearby side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to come out on the surface.
The theories of content are focused on researching what makes people angry or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they grow into adulthood.
This theory looks at what there is in certain people that makes them desire the things they do and which things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
The famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, the behavior should not come out when the manager starts to lead his former colleagues. One extreme end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels the need to change everything that the team has done and make it his own.
After all, the captain is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
I behave this way many times leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The virtual teams have to meet the same standards of excellence as the normal teams, but there are subtle differences.
The members of virtual teams often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
Often they have more autonomy than the members of a normal team because their teams can be located in different time zones that may not be understood by the local administration.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the administration team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization go through the process that takes time to establish a learning organization? Innovation is the goal to put into practice the concepts of organizational learning.
When all available resources are used well through the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be seen.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome a obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, the management has to create a culture of innovation as well as a shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) says that the Continuum approach is a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical strategy in his research. This narrows the area of investigation and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between nervous system pathology and behavior supports the scientists in this research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of damage to the brain, such as traumas, injuries, and tumors, have an effect on behavior and cause changes to certain mental functions.
The new technologies allow us to see and investigate structures and processes of the service like never seen before.
This gives a lot of information and materials to make simulation models that help understand the processes of our mind.
Although Artificial Intelligence involves a lot of fantasy, it is a very important part of computer science, and it deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
The study of AI concerns the realization of machines to make activities automatic that require intelligent behavior.
The examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognize handwriting, voice, and face.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is also often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and in the military field, as it has been implemented in many home computers and video game applications.
The school trips are a very important thing for every class. Many times the teachers would like to take their students to places where it's not possible to go by bus.
Technology provides a solution with virtual tours. Students can view artworks in a museum, visit an aquarium, or see art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual trip is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is redone, but the old versions are kept online like a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students write better. While students often share their experiences with blogs with grammar errors and poorly written words, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, what is written in the blog strives to be written better and avoid criticism.
It takes to maintain a blog "pushing students to become more expert in the world around them." The need to feed the public's interest inspires students to be more skilled and interesting (Toto, 2004).
A blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to spread learning well beyond the normal school day.
A correct use of blogs "can encourage students to become more analytical and critical; with active responses to internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of what others write, in addition to describing their personal perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is a beautiful and bilingual capital of Canada and has many art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
To the south there are Niagara Falls and to the north there is the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things also make Ontario be seen as the quintessence of Canada to outsiders.
Many areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost entirely uninhabited natural areas.
There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and as far as wild nature is concerned, it is a continent in itself.
A large part of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known for being luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought their land, Islam, which has had particular success in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and European colonialism began in the 15th century, with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama finding the route from Europe to India.
To the north the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: better to say that all the women who travel are married, it doesn't matter if it's true or not.
I'd rather bring along an umbrella (as long as it doesn't seem like a fancy thing).
The women must understand that cultural differences could be what they consider as harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, touched, grabbed by the arm, etc.
You have to be decisive in standing up to men, and not be afraid to make your reasons count (cultural differences or not, it's not right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port, called Anfa, by Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it with the name of Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco reconstructed the city as Daru I-Badya and gave the name Casablanca to the Spanish merchants who had established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old town there are places that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tajines, ceramics, footwear, hookahs and a variety of other items, but it's all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, close to the eastern border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the Nyiragongo volcano, which burned down most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
While Goma is reasonably secure, any other trip outside of Goma has to be prepared to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and some of the gorilla sighting expeditions in Africa.
You can hire a boda-boda (mototaxi) to go to Goma. The usual price (local) is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Together with the fact that it is relatively difficult to reach, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for exotic and distant places.
Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was included on the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It is one of the main episodes of the PBS special "Africa's Great Civilizations" by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is in strong contrast with other cities in the country, because it has a more Arab than African charm.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the crocodile river.
The park has a surface area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting various wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions of South Africa and is considered the symbol of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
In all the National Parks of South Africa, there are daily entrance fees to the park for conservation.
It can be a good idea to buy a Wild Card, which allows entry to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks of South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that tourists visit the most.
The series of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a shining bar chart, recognizable by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, go to the island and to Kowloon on the waterfront on the other side.
A large part of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is built on reclaimed land on the northern shore.
This is the place where the British colonizers took for themselves, so if you want to see something of the colonial past of the territory this is a great place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching for 80 kilometers (50 miles) in the territories of Bangladesh and India from the coastline.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO heritage site. The portion of the forest in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests aren't just mangrove swamps - they also have what remains of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans is an area of 3850 km² of which one third is water/swamp.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a sanctuary of wild nature, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although the majority, especially those going to the east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since interdistrict buses are often full, it is better to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Many districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient mode of transportation to go to nearby places, like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock Bridge is a spectacular bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The air draft under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge has been operational since September 2017, with the Brazilian customs control points completed.
The Guarani were the most significant ethnic group inhabiting Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurù and the Payaguà, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, called first "the gigantic province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish started the colonization period that lasted for three centuries.
Since its foundation in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
The Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
If it rains, it will be even worse.
For information about tournaments and where to buy polo gear, take a look at the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), whose value is fixed as equivalent to that of the British Pound (GBP).
The only bank on the island that is in Stanley in front of the FIC West store can exchange money.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the island and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
The credit cards of external islands are probably not accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; check in advance to see what method of payment is accepted.
It's almost impossible to change the currency of the Falkland Islands off the island, so change the money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is winter there when it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 degrees are common.
The winter can be disappointingly cool; the temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it always feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There haven’t been particularly “rainy” or “dry” seasons; the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Even though many of the park's mammals are used to seeing humans, wildlife is still wildlife and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from any other wild animal!
It doesn't matter how sweet they may seem, the bison, the deer, the reindeer, the bears, and any other large animal can attack.
Every year, the number of visitors decreases because they do not maintain a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous so respect their space.
. In general, be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly food and keep the base camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of around 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded around 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port became the site of a famous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to enter the port.
All the ships have been sunk except for a British transatlantic liner. While 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the fight for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the assassination of the great chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are so many beaches because Auckland is located in the middle of two harbors. The most famous ones are in three areas.
The North Shore (North Harbour district) faces the Pacific Ocean and extends from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
It's almost all sand dunes, with a hint of shade from the pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beach is on the Waitemata port, in the affluent neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
There are too many people at the beach sometimes, with many shops. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is the "Number One", it's not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to try, but those from New Zealand and Australia could be better.
The tap water can be drunk well, but the one in the bottle is easier to find if you don't trust it.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is unheard of. A short black is an "espresso", the cappuccino is topped with a thick layer of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian standard. The fruit juices are expensive but they are excellent.
Many trips to the coral reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to the reef are rare.
Follow, however, what the authorities say, obey the signs, and pay attention to safety signals.
The box jellyfish are visible at the beaches and the mouths of the rivers from October to April to the north of 1770. Sometimes they can be found outside of these periods.
The shark exists but rarely attacks humans. Most sharks are scared of humans and stay away.
The saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat is the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the security and peace of mind that there will be a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
The travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, even if you can book other places to stay, such as campsites, always with a travel agency.
The travel agents often offer packages that include accommodation, airport transportation options, or combined flight and hotel packages.
I can also hold your reservation in waiting if you need time to think about it or to obtain the necessary documents for your arrival (for example, a visa).
Every change or request must go through the agent first and not directly with the hotel.
At every festival, the majority of participants in music festivals choose to camp on site, and most of them consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be a part of the event, you must enter quickly to get a seat near the stage close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage has ended, there are still late-night events in which the music plays until late.
The festival has special areas for families with children.
If you cross the Baltic Sea in the winter, check where the cabin is, because going through the ice causes a terrible noise for everyone involved.
The cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (subject to regulation control).
The casino often makes a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by customers. The windows and clocks are often absent, and the exits can be difficult to find.
Usually they offer special deals on food, drinks and entertainment to keep the customers in a good mood and continue to make them spend money.
Certain places offer free alcoholic drinks. However, getting drunk hinders judgment, and good players of cards know the importance of staying sober.
Any person who wants to drive at high altitudes or beyond mountain passes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or subzero temperatures.
The streets are wet and slippery, the grip is low and you can't drive as if you were on asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall to block you in a short time.
The visibility can be restricted due to the falling snow, condensation, or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the most important tourist attraction in Africa and a big draw for many visitors.
The term "safari" in its popular use refers to a journey on land to see the incredible African wildlife, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals like elephants and giraffes tend to approach the machinery and the standard equipment allows for a good view.
The lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "footing") consists of a walking excursion, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other sites throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may find yourself in a complicated situation.
The rules for cancellation vary, but as of March, the cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
If it is expected that most of the events will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with the typical ticket selling for 7,000 yen.
Iron my clothes tomorrow morning at your leisure. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, even if one is not in the room.
If a iron is not available, or if you don't feel like ironing your socks, you can use a clothes steamer, if available.
Be careful not to make the fabric too hot (which can cause it to become too stiff or, in extreme cases, to burn).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against certain types of threats.
In some areas boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others it may require several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a problem, you can consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable store.
The travelers could catch parasites to which they were not accustomed in their place of origin.
The nuisance animals can be a source of irritation, can cause allergic reactions, spread disease or transmit infection.
Diseases spread, or dangerous animals that can harm or attack people are not considered harmful animals.
The duty free shopping represents the opportunity to buy goods tax-free and can be found in certain specific places.
Travelers coming from countries with higher taxes sometimes can save a good amount of money, especially for alcoholic beverages or tobacco products.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which frequently passes through isolated rural areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: important slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves predominate.
The speed limits indicated are usually lower than in previous and subsequent sections - commonly 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) - and compliance with these limits is even more important than in other circumstances.
Interestingly, however, the telephone signal is much stronger here than in other parts of the itinerary, like in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German pastries are quite good and in Bavaria they are truly rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
The fruits of the forest are common, with the same fruits present in the sweet all year round, and the strawberries and cherries that come out of season.
Many German dishes like roasted almonds, nuts, and other delicacies are often associated with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want to eat pastries that are delicious and rich, try the one called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made of herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "saucey" depending on the amount of liquid.

With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a comprehensive term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without other adjectives, the term tends to mean the traditional food of the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Available widely throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simple aromatic dishes, with the principal flavors that Javanese people love being lemongrass, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
The saddle provides stability to the rider but may present safety issues due to the potential for a rider to become trapped.
If a knight is thrown off a horse but has one foot stuck in the stirrup, he could be dragged away if the horse starts to run. To minimize this risk, it is necessary to take a series of safety precautions.
The majority of the knights wear riding boots with heels and a smooth and fairly narrow sole, as in the old days.
In addition, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that prevent the rider from falling off the saddle if pulled back by a horse that is falling.
The valley of Cochamó - the first Chilean destination for climbing, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a great variety of granite walls and cliffs.
The ascents include views rarely seen by few. Travelers from all parts of the world continuously establish new itineraries through its potential for endless walls.
During the winter, downhill sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snowy terrain using skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is an activity that calls many enthusiastic travelers, sometimes called "ski fanatics", who plan entire vacations to ski in a specific place.
The concept of skiing is very old - the tracks that represent skiers date back to 5,000 BC!
The sport of alpine skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was established by Norwegians in Australia.
Hiking with skis: this activity is also called ski touring, ski mountaineering or ski touring.
It is related but usually does not include skiing or mountaineering, since the latter two activities are done on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the skiing itinerary as similar to a hiking itinerary.
With good conditions, I can go faster than walking - but I will only rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through different countries would involve having to apply for many visas and getting your passport checked in many instances.
The Schengen zone, however, in this regard acts as a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross borders without being asked for your passport.
In the same way, having a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa to visit each Schengen member separately, saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition on which goods made by hand can be defined as antiques. Some tax agencies define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies geographically, with the age limit potentially being lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
The products made by hand could be defined as antiques even if they are younger than similar products made in bulk.
The raising of fish is an important means of sustenance for the Sami and the culture surrounding trade is also important for other types of professions.
Traditionally, not all Sami were involved in the reindeer breeding, but they lived from fishing, hunting, and the like, mainly keeping reindeer as pack animals.
On the other hand, modern necessities are needed many years later. Tourism provides significant income to Sapmi, the region of the Sami.
Even though it is widely used, especially among us Romani people, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive for its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel alert, your travel insurance or cancellation insurance could go up as a result.

It is strongly advised for those who travel to be aware of any risks of severe weather that may affect the area they are visiting as this could alter their travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for "Corso de ambiente ostiłe" will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course normally covers all the questions that we have discussed here in greater detail, usually with examples of practical experience.
A course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, a lot of first aid, and sometimes training with weapons.
The books and magazines that deal with survival in the wild nature are common, but the publications that deal with war zones are few.
Travelers planning to change their gender abroad must ensure they carry valid documents for their return.
The governments' willingness to issue passports without specifying (x) gender or updated documents with the preferred name and gender varies.
The willingness of governments to accept these documents is equally variable.

Before the operation, transgender individuals should not have to worry about going through scanners compromising their privacy and dignity.
The undertow is the flow that returns from the waves breaking on the shore, often on a cliff or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in certain deeper sessions, where a fast current can form towards the depth.
The majority of deaths occur as a result of the fatigue of trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you emerge from the current, getting back in is not more difficult than usual.
Try to direct yourself to places where you won't be recognized or, depending on your abilities or whether you have been noticed or not, you may expect a rescue.
The shock of returning arrives before the cultural shock (there is not even the "honeymoon phase"), it lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have been able to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to readapt to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you adapt to the new culture and may have lost some of your old cultural habits.
If they see you come by, for the first time, people probably are patient and understanding, since they know that travelers have to adjust to a new country.
People do not realize that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The spectacle of lights and sounds of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for people to see.
You can see the pyramids at night and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
You usually always hear the sound of tourists and sellers. The history of sound and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is the setting and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes shown on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The Southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several states and have the highest number of research stations, with seven active as of 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region to the south of the peninsula, delimited by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here are connected with the plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360km long Ellsworth Mountains, traversed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of the Antarctic, the Vinson Massif, with the peak of 4892 m of Mount Vinson.
In remote places, without cellular coverage, a satellite phone can be your only option.
A satellite phone generally does not replace your cellular phone, since to use the former you have to be outside with a clear line to the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used for deliveries, including transport and shipping, which require remote access and voice.
Your local provider should be able to give you information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a sabbatical year is traveling and learning.
This is popular especially among boys who have just finished school, which allows them to take a year off before university without compromising their studies.

Typically, there is a fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is known for its beautiful lakes and "land of a thousand lakes" also has a multitude of islands in its lakes and archipelagos off its coast.
In the archipelagos and lakes, a yacht is not really necessary.
Even though the archipelagos off the coast and the largest lakes are big enough for yachts, a small boat or even a kayak is a completely different experience.
'Going by boat is the national pastime in Finland, there is a boat for every seven or eight people.'
The same thing exists in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but for the rest it is quite unique (in Holland the ratio is one to forty).
Many of the characteristics of Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic center for a couple of days and stay on the ship at night.
If you disembark through cruise ship excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Berlin, Germany is shown on the brochure for certain cruises. As you can see from the map, Berlin is not at all close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never traveled before or have had a traumatic experience.

To understand how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear based on unknowns and lack of control.
The couriers are well paid to deliver goods quickly. Often, time is really important for travel documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On certain routes the larger companies have their planes, but for other routes and smaller cities there was a problem.
If I were to send the goods by air transport, on certain routes it would have been possible to return them in full to speed up the unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to make it easier was to send it as checked baggage. Air regulations do not allow sending baggage without a passenger, which is where you come into play.
The most convenient way to fly in first class or business class is to shell out a boatload of money for the privilege (or even better, have your company pay for you).
Anyway, it is not really economical: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times what you would pay in economy for a business class, and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no reason to look for discounts for the business class or first class on direct flights between A and B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member.
The economic canals have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the bankruptcy in the political negotiations.
In Moldova, the most common religion is Orthodox Christianity.

The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, and a vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are indicated only in Catalan because it has been established to be read as the first official language.
The Spanish language is also widely used in public transport and other services.
The regular announcements on the metro are only given in Catalan, but the special notices are always from an automatic system in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The Parisians have the reputation of being egoistic, rude, and arrogant.

The prejudices of the Parisians will quickly evaporate if you show a basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is largely forested, mainly with beech and fir trees, and it presents a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The area has a particularly large variety of plant communities due to its range of microclimates, different terrains, and varying altitudes.

A rare fauna can be found, including the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the golden eagle, along with many other common species.
While visiting the monasteries, the women must bring with them cloths to cover their heads as well as shawls to cover their shoulders.
Most of the monasteries provide lodging for women who arrive without, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Following the same line, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the entrance shop, but these clothes are not washed after each use, so you may feel uncomfortable wearing them. A lone cut for all men!
The Venetian kitchen, like that of other Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially rabbit), and uses olive oil extensively.

Since light pollution was not the only problem at its peak, it is often found in cities or university campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
The majority of modern research telescopes are enormous structures in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The cherry blossom viewing, called "hanami", is a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor alone for him and a few other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.

All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came either by swimming, flying, or walking.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced: goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, since the sky is dark for most of the day.
Since these towns are not very popular, and light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may expect.
The jacket and tie is the standard attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or title.
