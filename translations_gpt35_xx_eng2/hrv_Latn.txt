It is now confirmed that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but they have provided details that fossils usually do not give, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the upper side of the feathers of this animal was chestnut brown, while the lower side was pale or carotenoid.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs do not have well-developed central shaft called rachis, but have other feather features - barbs and barbules - researchers have concluded that the central shaft probably evolved later in evolution relative to those other features.
According to the structure of the feathers, it can be concluded that they were not used for flying, but rather for regulating temperature or display. Researchers claim that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of adult specimens, not the down of juveniles.
The research has shown that despite being from the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample is part of the adult bird's colored feathers, not chick down.
The car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was supposed to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team strived for is caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls the earth and causes tides, so does the Milky Way pull the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have proven that dark matter influences each other just like ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around galaxies forms a kind of halo around the galaxy consisting of numerous small particles.

In France, traditional voting does not involve high technology: voters are isolated in booths, where a pre-printed paper with the name of the chosen candidate is inserted into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The procedure is very strictly prescribed by the French electoral law.

Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision following specific procedures.

In her second giant slalom race, she finished in tenth place in women's sit skiing with a combined time of 4:41.30 - 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four skiers from the women's group did not manage to complete the course, and 45 out of the total of 117 female skiers in the Giant Slalom did not manage to qualify for the race.
The police of the state of Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D K Arya stated, "We have arrested five people suspected of raping a female from Switzerland and have found her mobile phone and laptop."
The suspects are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused came to court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when it was hit by a car, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services were freeing the driver from the red Audi TT.
In the beginning, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in the first instance court in Edinburgh since then, charged with the murder of her son.
In detention, she is awaiting indictment and trial, but there is a possibility that eyewitness evidence will be derivative because many media outlets have published her photograph.
That is a common practice everywhere in the United Kingdom, but the judiciary in Scotland operates differently and the courts considered the publication of the photos potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee points out that "it seems that journalists are dancing on a dangerous wire because of the publication of photos, etc. of suspects".
The Public Prosecutor's Office, which handles all criminal proceedings, has announced to the journalists that they will not give further comments at least until the charges are brought.
The document, according to the leaked information, will concern the border dispute, for which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future state of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires continuous military presence for ten years after signing the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to military presence for a duration of five years.
Hunters in the trial hunt for pest control would be under the strict supervision of park guards who would oversee and assess the effectiveness of the hunt.
Qualified volunteers were recruited within the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association, as part of the partnership between NPWS and the Australian hunting association, Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director for conservation and heritage of the park at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first culling operation have received extensive safety guidelines and undergone training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday in the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) which consists of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth temporary electoral council in four years.
Last month, the presidential committee mentioned the previous resignation of CEP as part of a package of measures towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes, the absence of elections that were supposed to be held since 2011 has triggered violent protests.
There have been about 60 reported cases of faulty iPods overheating, causing six fires and resulting in four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that it is aware of 27 accidents related to devices.
"Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry stated that Apple had informed them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company "does not consider serious"."
"The Ministry called Apple's postponement of the report ""truly unfortunate""."
An earthquake hit the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
From the Office for Emergency Management on the North Marijan Islands, it has been reported that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has stated that there are no signs of a tsunami.
The former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists captive by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired a shot at the tourists from his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued so far, and at least six of them have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released early along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later occupied the place of an older woman who had to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He was trained as a obstetrician and began working at the national maternity hospital for women in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that the application of hormones accelerates the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
The Xinhua agency reported that government investigators found two flight data recorders from the "black box" on Wednesday.
Colleagues wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away two months ago. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnells stated, "Luna was as peculiar as I am, if not more... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she has gone to a better place."
From 1400 respondents before the federal elections in 2010, the number of those opposing the proposal for Australia to become a republic since 2008 has increased by 8 percent.
Temporary Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of survey participants share the same opinion and believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last Australian ruler.
29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The winner of the gold Olympic medal was supposed to swim in the 100 and 200m freestyle races and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his health is now in question due to complaints.
He couldn't take painkillers because they are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number known as of January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was published on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water on Earth, along with organic materials that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists are interested in how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, with which comets collided long ago.
Cuomo's (53) mandate started earlier this year, and the governor signed a proposal last month to legalize same-sex marriages.
"He called the rumors 'political gossip and nonsense'."
It is assumed that he will run for president in 2016.
FAA claims that the NextGen system would enable shortening of aircraft flight routes, thus saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
Unlike older technology based on radars, this system utilizes satellite technology so that air traffic controllers can more precisely locate aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation options will be organized, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley. Additionally, parking facilities and ground-level parking and access to public transportation will not be available.
Due to fear of transportation shortages, there is a possibility that the match might have to be moved indoors without any spectators.
The research published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the development of a new species of birds on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species have evolved within just two generations, although it was believed that this process takes much longer, due to the interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the newcomer from the finch genus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into any possible shape. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be threaded through a thin wire, which can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered in or rolled into flat surfaces.
"It can be very thin and stick to another metal. It can be so thin that it is sometimes used for decorating hand-painted pictures in books called ""illuminated manuscripts""."
This is called chemical pH. An indicator can be red cabbage juice.
The brine changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) the chemicals are.
The pH value is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in the pH abbreviation) in the tested chemical.
Hydronium ions are protons without electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix together two dry powders, then press them into a ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, and the reaction will tickle and cause the formation of a shell.
In Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, every house was equipped with at least one flushing toilet that was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in the buildings of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. During the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women socialized together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, use satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call, and then almost immediately reflects it back down.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists in space use a telescope because Earth's atmosphere distorts part of the light and view.
To send a satellite or telescope into space, a massive rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheel brought unimaginable changes to the world. The greatest change was that the invention of the wheel enabled much easier and faster transport for us.
He enabled the invention of trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
In the end, many small cats (including house cats) eat a much more varied small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the concept of niche, that is, the special position that each cat occupies, so it doesn't have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats that live in large groups called prides.
Prides of lions consist of one to three closely related adult males and up to thirty females and offspring.
Females are usually in close relation and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a complete athlete, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, leap great distances and drag with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not similar to the roar at full volume that a lion has, but more like a string of unintelligible, shouted words.
Ocelots eat small animals. They love monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all of the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by scent, sniffing the trail left by the prey on the ground.
Ocelots have very good night vision and move very stealthily. They hunt their prey by blending in with their environment and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (for example, during crossing over a mountain or river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment.
New environment means different resources and different competition, so the new population needs characteristics or adaptations that differ from the previous ones in order to compete for resources.
The population has not changed at all, they still have to make the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it becomes less similar to the other population.
Over time, after thousands and even millions of years, two populations will differ so much in appearance that they will not be able to be called the same species.
This process we call speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants create oxygen that people inhale and then take in carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants create food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shelter.
Houses and clothes are made from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaur was the top predator of its time so it wasn't afraid of anything, except for other mosasaurs.
His long jaw had more than 70 sharp teeth along with an additional set on the palate, which means there was no help for anyone who crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but it is possible that he had a forked tongue. His diet consisted of turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and there may have been cannibalism.
He would attack anything that entered the water; not even massive dinosaurs like T. rex would have been a match for him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had a number of unusual or unconventional delicacies that included wild boar, peacocks, snails, and dormice.
The second difference was that the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, while the wealthy men enjoyed common feasts where they dined lying on their side.
Meals of ancient Romans could not have contained ingredients that arrived in Europe from America or Asia during the following centuries.
For example, they were not familiar with corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no one in ancient Rome had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
People were making sacrifices to the gods, and the priests were trying to satisfy the needs of the gods by organizing ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramids have formed towers, so-called ziggurats, which were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special divine sanctuary.
In the warm climate conditions of the Middle East, the house was not as important.
Most of the life of Hebrew families took place outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops had counters open to the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Norwegian sagas tell how Erik the Red, after being exiled from Iceland for murder, discovered Greenland on his westward journey and gave it that name.
Despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
"Although all countries were ""Scandinavian"", there are many differences among the people, kings, customs and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland."
If you have watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not correct. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"The original Declaration of Independence was written on July 4, 1776. The text is located at the bottom of the document, upside down."
No one knows for certain who wrote this large document on parchment (measuring 29¾ by 24½ inches), but it is known that it was rolled up for storage shortly after it was made.
Therefore, that entry was likely added simply as a marker.
The landing as part of D-Day and the ensuing battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
There the French from "Vichy France" were in power. They were the French who in 1940 made peace with the Germans and worked together with the conquerors instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies attacked southern France. The attack is known as "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and advanced towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together - society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, and refers to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also determines the size of society in some way.
City-states are the precursors of states. Civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, a presence in culture, and equal spreading.
Lesser cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence so we do not recognize them as true civilizations.
During the American War for Independence, thirteen states established a weak central government consisting only of congress by the constitutional document Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, since there was no state or judicial authority, it relied on the competent bodies that often did not cooperate when implementing all acts.
He also did not have the authority to cancel tax laws and customs between states.
For the amendment of the Agreement, unanimous consent of all states was required, but the states did not take the central authority seriously, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and they were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions where the Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
"Since it consists of a cluster of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from the perspective of geographical expertise."
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, "beautiful island," during their voyage around the island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan in 1624 and initiated the transformation of indigenous practices in cereal production, as well as employed Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar cane plantations.
The Qing dynasty (1644 - 1912) forcibly took over the management of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing dynasty in 1885.
1895. After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894 - 1895), the Qing government signed the agreement in Shimonoseki, surrendering sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled it until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: Intihuatana, Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better insight into how they originally came to be.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu has been restored by 1976 and the restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the most common photo format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main film size towards the end of the analog film era.
The products are still being produced today, but more importantly, digital cameras still have the same sensor image formats.
The fact that the 35-millimeter format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high is somewhat confusing.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain a ratio expressed as whole numbers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (such as formats from the APS group) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio of the width and height of the image.
The rule of thirds, which is often broken and ridiculed, is a simple guideline for creating dynamism with some retaining of order in the picture.
He states that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church became the subject of criticism.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has connected European countries that had different languages and customs.
The strong power of Christianity influenced everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and reduce poverty, and that the church's financial resources exist specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church has been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether they adhere to that principle.
Soon after the outbreak of armed conflict, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy worked because it prevented the German access to vital military and civilian supplies, but the blockade violated the generally accepted international law codified in several international agreements over the last two centuries.
Great Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire parts of the ocean, posing a danger to neutral ships.
Given that there was not a great interest in this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, a pacifist attitude and separation prevailed among most citizens and people.
After experiencing horrors and atrocities during World War I, people wanted to avoid such a situation from happening again in the future.
Tesla moved to United States in 1884 to take a job at Edison's company in New York.
In the USA, he arrived with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation that Charles Batchelor (the supervisor at his previous job) sent to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each family in power was a recognizable dynasty.
Between each dynasty followed an unstable period of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars were taking place among the nobles in the struggle for the throne.
Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China; thousands of people died in the battle for the top position in the great palace of Xi'an.
The consequences are of a social and political nature, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to the ruler.
In addition, after the Revolution, employment was available to all men and the most ambitious and successful were given a chance to succeed.
The same goes for the military, as after the revolution, ranks were awarded based on ability, not social status.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people of the working class from other countries to start their own revolution.
"Muhamed was very interested in questions beyond the boundaries of his boring life. He visited the cave that became famous under the name "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) to be able to think better."
The cave that has survived through history provides a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual values.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find it at all, even if you know for sure it exists. Once you find yourself in the cave, you are completely isolated.
One can see nothing but the pure, beautiful sky and many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists.
The pyramid of Khufu, which was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of the many great pyramidal structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
"The Giza Plateau, also known as the 'Necropolis of Giza' in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx."
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and a multitude of smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of the wives of Pharaoh Khufu and members of his family.
"The marking "bowing upwards" looks like a V and "bowing downwards" like a staple or a square without the bottom side."
The up bow sign means to start from the top and push the bow, and the down bow sign means to start from the frog (where we hold the bow with our hand) and pull the bow.
Raised bow usually creates a softer sound, while lowered bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to add your own markings, but remember that the bowing markings are printed for musical reasons, so they should generally be followed.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister Elizabeth were forced by a crowd of women to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people who were screaming and shouting threats to the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At one point, a member of the mob swung the head of the royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime in order to cover a large portion of the costs, and bond interest rates were changing through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the huge profit resulting from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos will constitute the main profit of American imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, we must understand the context in which the order was established.
The period of these events is usually called the High Middle Ages, and it is a period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 - 1300 AD).
The developed Middle Ages were preceded by the early Middle Ages, and followed by the late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological impetus or technological imperative to a strict understanding that human fate is guided by the fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology follows a path largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the invention of the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, the road network throughout the country does not pay off for just a few cars, so new ways of production have been developed to reduce the costs of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which leads to the discovery of new techniques in healthcare for treating injuries.
In Romanticism there was a strong element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and over time customs and culture related to geography emerge that are in line with the physical habitat of society, and therefore are better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe, just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world.
He was known as the epicenter of luxury from 400 BCE to around 1100 BCE.
The situation worsened in the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders returned with silk and spices that had a greater value than what the Byzantine market offered.
In this time, the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style was in the 10th to 11th century and in the 14th century.
The dress was initially influenced by the strong influence of Byzantine culture from the east.
However, due to slow communication, styles in the west were lagging behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest discoveries of that time, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons on clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture for the production of sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple and often organic system that uses seed native to the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
In the past, the majority of farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, which still holds true for many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ by age, ethnic background, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that make a subculture unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often show their belonging through recognizable and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners and slang.
One of the methods commonly used to illustrate the importance of socialization is by giving examples of unfortunate cases of children who did not undergo socialization by adults during their upbringing, either as a result of neglect, accidents, or intentional abuse.
Such children are called uncultivated or wild. Some wild children are imprisoned by people (most often their own parents). In some cases, abandoning a child is the result of parents refusing to accept that their child has a severe intellectual or psychological impairment.
Wild children can experience severe abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or run away.
Other people are assumed to have been raised by animals, and some allegedly lived in the wild on their own.
If they were completely raised by animals, wild children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) that are almost entirely similar to the behaviors of the animal that raised them, such as a fear of humans or indifference towards humans.
Although learning through projects should make learning easier and more interesting, setting up scaffolding takes it a step further.
Setting up scaffolding, i.e. providing support, is not an educational method, but rather a support for individuals facing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, as well as an animated clip that appears in Microsoft Office programs.
Virtual setting up of scaffolding is internalized in the software and is intended for testing, directing, and explaining procedures that may present too much of a challenge for the student to solve on their own.
Children enter the foster care system for various reasons, from neglect to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring, and educational, yet it still happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is responsible for ensuring safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Fostering should meet all the needs that are lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The recognizable features of the internet open additional dimensions in terms of usage and access.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important reasons for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
During the investigation of visitor reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "continued relationships" as new motivational aspects.
The use of video recordings has allowed for important discoveries in interpreting microexpressions, fleeting facial expressions that last a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to discern whether a certain person is lying by accurate interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work "The President's Speech," claims that people who cannot understand speech due to brain injury can still accurately assess its sincerity.
He hinted that even animals like domestic dogs have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variations: concealed and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, while selection removes the expressed variations from the set.
Segregation and recombination in each generation transfer the variability between those two sources.
In savannas, it is difficult for primates with a digestive system similar to humans to meet their need for amino acids from available plant sources.
On the contrary, failure has serious consequences: lower growth, poor nutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources were proteins from leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest when raw.
On the contrary, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also contains large amounts of protein that contain all essential amino acids.
"When all is considered, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved the ""protein intake question"" in almost the same way as chimpanzees in the savannah do today."
The interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period and then going back to sleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
It is possible by using a relatively quiet alarm to come to consciousness without fully waking up.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythmic options include consuming plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which will make you get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is in inverse correlation with the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The smaller the tension, the more positive the life force present. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
Everyone can experience enlightenment. The only thing standing in our way to that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it is expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It encompasses Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
Kundalini yoga awakens the kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) with the help of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The divine yoga is at the center of Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated, and awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to collaboration between the USSR and the USA. After the war, differences in systems, practices, and cultures led to hostility between the two countries.
Two years before the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and would be led by truly empowered armies on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense suffered a collapse, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans failed almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered Poland and created a Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading the eastern Polish regions, thus violating the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Transport of goods by ship is definitely the most efficient way for a large number of people and a large amount of goods to cross the ocean.
The role of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time preventing the enemy from moving their people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. Americans tried to transport personnel and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
The German navy, which mainly used submarines, was trying to stop this traffic at the same time.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would likely have succeeded in conquering Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and leather.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills and other pastures, and they were tended by so-called goatherds, usually children or adolescents, which is the term for shepherds who tend goats. These pastoral methods are still used today.
The train tracks for the carts pulled by horses were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the first wooden railway tracks were made up of just parallelly arranged planks, they allowed horses pulling the wagons to move faster and pull heavier loads than would have been possible on slightly more uneven roads of that time.
Thresholds were installed quite early to keep the rails in place. However, it gradually became apparent that the rails could be more efficient with iron on top.
This has become a common practice, but the iron has caused more wear and tear on the wooden cart wheels.
In the end, iron wheels replaced wooden ones. The first completely iron rails were presented in 1767.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, people began walking upright two million years ago when Homo erectus (upright man) appeared.
Their ancestors, the australopithecus, usually didn't walk upright.
Bipedal walking appears in australopithecines around 4.2-3.9 million years ago, and it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more in harmony with the environment, we can join ecological movements, and we can even be activists to somewhat reduce suffering in the future.
In many cases, this is like symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not seek a solution that is only temporary, we must find the root of these problems and neutralize them.
It is obvious that the world has greatly changed thanks to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and the problems are getting bigger due to overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of people.
After Congress adopted the handwritten draft on July 4th, which was signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, it was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing house.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The document was publicly read for the first time by John Nixon on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9. The copy arrived in London on August 10.
25 Dunlap copies known to still exist are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The original handwritten document is not preserved.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many do not perceive them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
Many characteristics of birds resemble those of dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on handling information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
Perhaps the best indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medications or household poisonous chemicals.
Look for special first aid instructions related to that poison on the label.
The term "bugs" is used by entomologists in an official capacity for this group of insects.
This term comes from the well-known bedbugs, insects that have adapted very well to parasitizing humans.
Bedbugs and common bugs depend on their hosts, in whose nests or living spaces they reside.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged individuals.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis than men.
The couple can conclude that raising a newborn is not in their best interest or the best interest of their child.
Such couples can give their child up for adoption.
During adoption, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand the functioning of the world through the scientific method. This method is actually a guideline for most scientific research.
In addition to that method, experimenting, or testing that represents tests for eliminating one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and observing also guide scientific research.
Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, have been accepted.
As knowledge about the Greeks declined, the West began to sever its ties with Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not only a response to external cyclic stimuli, have been discovered in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue the free-running period even if there are no external cues.
The experiment performed by Hershey and Chase was one of the leading pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They carried out two experiments that indicated DNA with radioactive phosphorus or protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the affected cells are in the germline.
Mutations can only be passed on to offspring through mutations in the germ cells, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of activities at the location include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns and travel by car to their workplace while those whose workplace is the place they just left pass by them.
In this dynamic transportation scenario, everyone is somehow connected to a traffic system based on private cars and supports it.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, there are few complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
Why are traffic systems the cause of so many complaints; why do they fail daily? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something much bigger at hand?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
English sentence: Luckily, drivers usually behave relatively consistently, so traffic flows have a certain reasonable consistency and can be roughly mathematically represented.
For a better representation of traffic flow, connections between three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These reports help in planning, designing, and working on road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly enabled them to escape from enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This allows them to have a greater number of small places to hide from predators.
Today the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the damselfly and dragonfly.
Several thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some believed he was right, but many were convinced otherwise - that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
That seems reasonable because we don't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It contains more than 8 times as much water as the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, some six miles wide in places.
20 percent of the water flowing out of the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6387 km (3,980 miles) long. It is fed by water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids were built up until the collapse of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the size and technical excellence of the pyramids at Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also a daily language used by the majority of those who work in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they can all be found in nature in their pure form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything is made up of one or a mixture of more than four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
That was more like four aggregate states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also theorized about them changing into new substances in order to form into what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil became a close friend to a large number of people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pen has lost its status and is being used less and less.
People today write messages on computer screens, so they don't even need a pencil.
We can only assume what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes up.
The physical bomb works on the principle of taking energy to assemble a core with numerous protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing heavy stroller uphill. Splitting the core re-releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with slight nudging or without nudging.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. We call the outer layer of the Moon the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
Tanji is in the area of lunar seas, and thicker is in the area of highlands.
On the nearer side, there could be more dark areas because the crust is thinner. The lava came to the surface more easily.
Theories of content are focused on discovering what motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized with maturation and upbringing.
These theories consider what motivates some people to want what they want and which phenomena in the environment motivate them to do or not do something.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum are attempts to still "be part of the team."
This type of leader faces difficulties when making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, conducting evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable individual who thinks they must change everything they have done so far and do it their way.
The team leader is ultimately responsible for its success or failure.
This behavior often leads to a gap between leaders and others.
Virtual teams should adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are minor differences.
Members of virtual teams often serve as the touchpoint to the closest physical group.
They are often more autonomous than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which local management may not understand.
"The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."
"The Invisible Team" represents a leadership team to which each member is accountable. The Invisible Team sets the standards for each member.
Why would the organization go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization again? Innovation is one of the aims of putting organizational learning concepts into practice.
After efficient use of all available resources in all functional departments of the organization, creativity and resourcefulness come to the fore.
As a result, the process of organization that strives to overcome obstacles through collaboration can lead to a new innovative process for meeting customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) continuous improvement is explained as a method through which organizations can achieve a higher level of efficiency.
Neurobiological data represent physical evidence for the theoretical approach to studying cognition. This makes the research field narrower and much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior is confirmed by research of scientists.
Different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors have long been known to affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction connotation, it constitutes a very important branch of information science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research on artificial intelligence involves creating machines for the purpose of automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, and recognizing handwriting, voice, and faces.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now often used in economics, medicine, construction, and the military because it is built into some software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a significant part of every class. Often, the teacher would eagerly take her students to places where traveling by bus is not an option.
Technology offers a solution for virtual field trips. Students can explore museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Virtual sharing of trips is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the page changes, but the old versions are preserved online as a kind of time capsule.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. When they start blogging, students often make mistakes in grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience usually corrects this in most cases.
Since students are the most critical audience, the blog writer starts striving to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
Writing a blog also "forces students to become more resourceful in the world around them". The need to engage the interest of the audience inspires them to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to transfer learning outside of the traditional school.
"Appropriate use of blogs can stimulate students to engage in analytical and critical thinking; by actively reacting to internet materials, students can define their own position in the context of others' writings and present their own perspective on certain issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is a charming capital city of Canada and offers a range of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
A bit further south are the Niagara Falls, while the north is home to untouched natural beauty in the Muskoka region and beyond.
Because of all these things, foreigners experience Ontario as quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas further to the north are very sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
In the USA, there are more African Americans than there are citizens of Canada, which surprises many people with its population density.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and can be considered a continent when it comes to plant and animal life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or have ties to France and are known for their luxurious resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to the country, which took deep roots in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area is surrounded by the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that women traveling say they are married regardless of their actual marital status.
It helps even if you wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in something that could be considered harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow them, grab their hand, etc.
Decisively reject men and do not be afraid to stand up for yourself (it is not okay regardless of cultural differences!).
The present-day Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and during the time of the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids, the city was known as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and then rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan renovated the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who established their trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as rugs, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of knick-knacks, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town on the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, close to Rwanda.
Lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma in 2002, burying most of the city streets, especially the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma should be explored to understand the nature of the conflicts taking place in the North Kivu province.
The city also serves as a starting point for the ascent to the Nyiragongo volcano and some of the cheapest options for trekking with mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (moto taxi) to visit Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
"Because of its relative inaccessibility, 'Timbuktu' is now used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands."
Although his reputation makes it a tourism attraction and it has an airport, Timbuktu is now a impoverished city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat of sandstorms.
That was one of the main places where Henry Louis Gates stopped while filming the PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is a complete contrast to other cities in the country because it has more influences from the Arab rather than the African world.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique in the east and Zimbabwe in the north, with the Crocodile River forming its southern boundary.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² divided into 14 different eco-zones, each inhabited by a different species of wild animals.
One of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the premier South African National Park (SANParks).
As in other South African national parks, it is necessary to pay daily conservation fees and entrance tickets.
Someone might also benefit from buying a joker ticket that allows entry to specific parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong was named after the island of Hong Kong, which is a major center for many tourists.
The exhibition of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline is comparable to a glittering columnar graph, which is even more noticeable thanks to the sea in Victoria Harbor.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The vast majority of urban development on the Hong Kong island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
The British colonizers have claimed these places, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal belt of mangroves in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast all the way to Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The portion of the forest located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not just mangrove swamps. They include some of the last remaining sites of powerful jungles that once covered the Ganges Valley.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which roughly one-third is covered by waterlogged areas.
The Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for wildlife since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer living there.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) all day, but most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Considering that inter-county buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a couple of days in advance.
In most counties, small Japanese Toyota Coaster buses are used, which are comfortable and durable.
Taxi sharing is a quick and pleasant way to travel to nearby places, such as the towns of Paro (150 Nu.) and Punakha (200 Nu.).
The hanging bridge stretches over the Oyapock River. The bridge over the Oyapock River connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Two towers rise to a height of 83 meters. It is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and the bridge was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The opening of the bridge is scheduled for September 2017, when the completion of the Brazilian customs control points is expected.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous community settled in today's eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The province of Chaco was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurúa and Payaguá, who lived off hunting, gathering fruits, and fishing.
After the encounter of Spanish conquerors with the indigenous population in the 16th century, Paraguay emerged, previously known as "Great Province of India".
The Spaniards began a three-century period of colonization.
Paraguay has largely managed to retain its indigenous character and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
The Argentine national team and players are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also held in other parts of the year.
For news on tournaments and information on where to buy tickets for half-time matches, check the website of the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
On remote islands, they probably don't accept credit cards, but they may accept British and American currency; inquire with the owner in advance to find out about the acceptable payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before you leave the archipelago.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter on the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone; the usual temperatures in the summer months are around +30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and moisture creates a feeling that it is colder than the thermometer shows.
"There are no distinct "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rain is mostly the same throughout the year."
Although many animals in the park are used to human visits, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park management's instructions, maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from other wild animals!
Regardless of how obedient they may seem, bison, deer, reindeer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year dozens of visitors get injured because they did not keep an appropriate distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, keep in mind that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food, and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
A disgraceful naval battle unfolded in the port in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships have sunk except for one British cruise ship. Almost 200 German and American citizens lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence led by the Mau movement, the supreme leader Tupua Tamasesea Lealofia III was assassinated during a peaceful gathering in the city.
In Auckland, there are two harbors with many beaches. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
Beaches on the northern coast (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean shore and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
All the beaches are sandy, it is safe to swim on them, and many of them are shaded by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
It's about family beaches where there is sometimes a crowd with a large number of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One". The beer is not complex, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines you must try, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might suit you better.
Local tap water is safe for drinking, but if you are cautious, you can easily find bottled water.
The concept of "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians. A short black coffee is called "espresso", cappuccino has a lot of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is on par with Belgian. The fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many visit the ridge throughout the year, and injuries caused by any of the mentioned causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, respect all signs, and adhere to safety warnings.
Marine stingers appear near beaches and river mouths north of the town of 1770 from October to April. Sometimes they also appear in other months.
Sharks exist, but they often attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Sea crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their main habitat is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance takes the burden off the traveler's shoulders because they know they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camps, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, organized transportation to/from the airport, or even combination flight and hotel packages.
I can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or obtain any other documents necessary for your arrival at the destination (e.g. visa).
However, all changes or requests should first be addressed to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of participants camp at the festival location and most of them consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be as close as possible to the stage, you will have to come early in order to secure a spot.
Keep in mind that even if the music on the main stages finishes, some parts of the festival will continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas designed for families with young children.
If you are traveling through the northern Baltic in winter, be careful when choosing a cabin because passing through ice creates a terrible noise that is more audible in certain cabins.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Passengers on the cruise do not need to have a visa (check the requirements).
The casinos usually try to maximize the amount of time and money that guests spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and the exits are hard to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to maintain the good mood of the guests and keep them in the facility.
Some venues offer free alcoholic drinks. However, drunkenness impairs judgment and all good gamblers are aware of how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or subzero temperatures.
On back roads and snow-covered roads, there is little friction and you cannot drive as if you were on clean asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a short period of time for you to get stuck in it.
Visibility can also be limited by snowfall or snow carried by the wind, condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many countries, but traffic mostly runs smoothly throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest draw for tourists in Africa and the best experience for many visitors.
The concept of safari in everyday usage refers to a land travel for the purpose of visiting astonishing African wild animals, especially in savannas.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to the car and a good view is possible with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
The pedestrian safari (also called "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "walking safari") consists of walking that lasts from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will take place at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo, host of the 1964 Games, will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games.
If you booked a flight and accommodation for the 2020 Games before they were postponed, you could find yourself in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus were not extended until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were supposed to take place.
It is expected that tickets for most events will cost between 2,500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 ¥.
You can dry wet clothes by ironing them. Many hotels will rent you an iron and ironing board even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can also use a hairdryer if it's available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can lead to shrinking or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are different methods of water purification, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough for the water to boil for one minute, while in others, it is necessary for several minutes.
Filters differ in efficiency, and if you have any doubts, buy water in closed bottles from reputable companies.
Passengers may encounter pests they are not used to in their region.
Pests can spoil food, cause itching, or in worse cases, trigger allergic reactions, transmit poison or infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people through the use of force are usually not classified as plagues.
Shopping at duty-free stores represents an opportunity to purchase products exempt from taxes and duties at certain locations.
Passengers traveling to countries with high taxes can save a significant amount of money, especially when purchasing alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most demanding driving conditions on the Buffalo – Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be prepared for everything: steep inclines, narrow passages, and sharp turns.
The prescribed speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and following sections, usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and strict compliance with the limits is more important than usual.
It is interesting, however, that the mobile service here is better than on many other road sections, e.g. Pennsylvania WIlds.
German baked goods are quite good and diverse in Bavaria, like in the southern neighboring country of Austria.
Desserts made from dough with fruit are common, for example with apples which are added to desserts year-round, as well as with cherries and plums which are used in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. A cup of strong coffee often goes well with popular cakes.
If you crave small but hearty bites, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
"Depending on the amount of liquid, curry can be ""dry"" or ""wet""."
Yogurt is a common ingredient in curries in the interior of northern India and Pakistan; in southern India and some coastal parts of the subcontinent, coconut milk is most commonly used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is the umbrella term for a multitude of regional cuisines throughout the country.
However, if used without further supplements, the term denotes food that is originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago and consists of a variety of simply spiced dishes with the favorite flavors of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices predominating.
Stirrups are the footrests for the rider hanging on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, but also involve certain safety risks as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If the rider is thrown off the horse but his leg is stuck in the stirrup, the horse could drag him if it runs away. To reduce the risk, certain safety measures need to be taken.
First, most drivers wear boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Those with breakaway stirrups and especially English stirrups, include safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if the rider falls and pulls backward.
The Cochamó Valley is the main climbing destination in Chile, also known as the South American Yosemite thanks to the diversity of large granite cliffs and crags.
From the peaks, breathtaking views extend. Climbers from all parts of the world constantly establish new routes among the endless possibilities it offers.
Snow sports involving descending a slope, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending a snowy slope using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important tourist activity, and many people known as "ski enthusiasts" plan their annual vacations around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - images of skiers in caves date back to 5000 BC!
The descent as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians in Australia opened the first recreational skiing club.
Traveling with a backpack on your back and on skis: also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is associated with alpine skiing or mountaineering even though it usually does not include them. Mountaineering usually takes place on steep terrain and requires firmer skis and boots.
Imagine a ski slope as a similar trail to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover greater distances than by walking, but you will very rarely reach the speed of ski running without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it consists of numerous independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean applying for a visa multiple times and going through passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, functions in this respect as one country.
As long as you are in that zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa in each individual Schengen member country, saving time, money, and reducing the amount of paperwork.
There is no universal definition of antiques. Some tax authorities define antiques as goods older than 100 years.
There are geographical differences in the definition, so the age limit in places like North America may be smaller than in Europe.
Handmade products can be called antiques even though they were created later than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of income among the Sami people, and the culture associated with trading is also important for many people in other professions.
However, traditionally, not all members of the Sámi people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding but lived from fishing, hunting, and the like, and the reindeer mostly served them for pulling.
Today, many Sámi people are engaged in modern crafts. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi area, Sápmi.
"Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Romani peoples, it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Roma."
If the country you are traveling to ends up on the list of countries for which a warning has been issued, it may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You can consult with other governments besides your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East can find themselves in different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The tips are a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The expressed opinions are often short, general, and too simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
The storm is a generic term for any phenomenon of dangerous weather with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Harsh weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world in various forms, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of dangerous weather conditions, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, downpours, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Passengers are advised to be aware of the potential risk of bad weather in their area as it may affect travel plans.
Everyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo specialized training.
"If you do an internet search with the keywords "course for hostile environments", you will find the address of a local company."
The course generally covers in more detail all the topics discussed here, usually with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, many lessons related to first aid, and sometimes firearms handling training.
Many books and magazines deal with wilderness survival, but publications that cover war zones are rare.
Passengers planning to have sex reassignment surgery abroad must bring valid documents for their return.
Willingness to issue passports in which the gender (X) is not specified or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies from government to government.
The readiness of foreign governments to respect such documents also varies from government to government.
Searches at checkpoints have also become more drastic in the era after September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not undergone surgery will likely not pass through a scanner without compromising their privacy and dignity.
The return current is a returning surge of waves breaking against the shore, often against a reef or similar.
Because of the underground topography, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper parts and it is possible to create a fast current towards greater depths.
Death usually occurs when a person becomes exhausted trying to swim against the current, which is often impossible.
As soon as you pull yourself out of the current, swimming back is not any harder than usual.
Try to swim in a way that the current doesn't catch you again or, depending on your skills and whether someone has noticed you, you can wait for help.
The shock of returning to your own culture occurs before the culture shock. The phase of enjoyment is shorter, the shock lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their homeland.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits that belong to your own culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers in a new country need time to adjust.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are necessary when passengers return to their home.
The sound and light show at the Pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in that area.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and in silence before the start of the show.
Usually the sounds of tourists and traders can be heard. The story of sound and light is like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx is in the role of the background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases - sixteen active ones in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
The rest include the island of Livingston and Deception, where the flooded crater of an still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land region is located south of the island, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge into plateaus, then rise again and form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range cut by the Minnesota glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson massif, whose highest peak is Vinson at 4892m.
In remote areas without signal coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
Satellite phone is usually not a replacement for a mobile phone because you have to make calls in the open and the satellite must be in your line of sight to complete the call.
The service is often used in freight forwarding, on recreational vessels, but also on expeditions that require remote data and voice transmission.
The phone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
The increasingly popular option for those planning to take a year off is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular among those who are leaving school because it allows them to take a gap year before college without compromising their education.
In many cases, attending a course abroad during your gap year can actually improve your chances of transitioning to higher education in your own country.
There is usually a tuition fee for enrolling in these educational programs.
"Finland is a great destination for boating. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands on the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos."
You don't necessarily need a yacht for the archipelago and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are large enough for yacht sailing, exploring them with smaller boats or kayaks offers a completely different experience.
Sailing is a national hobby in Finland, which has one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
The situation is similar in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands, that number is one in forty).
Most known Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several days and return to sleep on the boat at night.
If you are traveling to the mainland as part of a boat trip, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures also include a stop in Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all age groups and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
There is no need to be ashamed of it: it is no different from the fears and aversions that many people feel towards other things.
Understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome fear based on unfamiliarity or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast delivery of shipments. Often, time is of the essence when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own airplanes, but the problem arose on other routes and with smaller companies.
If the cargo is sent by air, unloading and customs procedures on some routes could take days.
The only way to get through this faster is to send the items as checked baggage. According to the rules of the airline, baggage cannot travel without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
Of course, you will be able to fly in first or business class if you are willing to fork out a thick stack of cash for that privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: generally speaking, expect it to cost you up to four times more than the usual price of economy class seats, that is eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, it doesn't make any sense to seek discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that a certain group of passengers are willing to pay a large sum of money for the privilege of fast and comfortable travel, and they accordingly set prices.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The language of the population is Romanian but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has faced ethnic conflicts.
The conflict in 1994 led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but has not been recognized by any UN member countries.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established despite the failure in political negotiations.
The Orthodox faith is the majority religion in Moldova.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million. It is the second largest port after Istanbul and a very well-connected transportation hub.

Keep in mind that you are visiting a location of a mass grave that has almost immeasurable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still a large number of men and women who have survived, as well as those whose relatives were killed or worked to death there, whether they were Jews or not.
Act towards this place with the dignity and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the place with painted or carved graffiti on existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understands it and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
Yes, Spanish also has a wide application in public transportation and other infrastructure.
Regular announcements in the metro are in Catalan, but unplanned disturbances are announced through an automatic system in multiple languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known as rude and arrogant egocentrics.
Although it is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to navigate Paris is to be polite, or to behave as someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will significantly ease your stay.
The haughty demeanor of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show some basic kindness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, with beech, spruce, and fir trees being the most common. The park is characterized by a combination of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The park is home to a particularly wide range of plant communities thanks to various microclimates, soil types, and variations in altitude within the park.
In that area lives an extremely diverse range of animal and bird species.
Here can be found rare animal species such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, along with many other more common species.
During the visit to the monastery, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and clothing that covers their shoulders.
Most monasteries have coverings for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own covering, especially in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men must wear pants that cover the knees.
You can borrow them at the entrance, but this clothing is not washed after every visitor so you may not feel comfortable wearing it. The sizes are universal!
Majorcan cuisine, like those in similar Mediterranean zones, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil in everything.
Bread with olive oil is a favorite simple dish that is especially eaten in the summer: it is bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any addition that is on hand, such as cheese, tuna, and more.
"All nouns, but also the pronoun "Sie" which means "you" always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence."
This is an important way of distinguishing some verbs from objects.
Without a doubt, it makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated with the need to determine whether the verb or adjective is used in the nominal form.
The pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters to especially pay attention to are c and g because their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also be careful to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means car.
The grammar of the Persian language is relatively simple and mostly regular.
This grammar primer will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
Of course, if you know a Romance language, you will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know some Spanish can easily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it is not necessary to learn it separately.
Pre-modern observatories today are often outdated and used as museums or educational sites.
Mild pollution in their prime days wasn't the issue it is today. They are usually located in cities or campuses and are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
The most modern research telescopes are huge objects in remote areas with favorable weather conditions.
Watching the cherry blossom, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China where the favorite flower was the plum blossom.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held by the Emperor only for himself and other members of the nobility around the imperial palace.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove "just one" specimen.

Internal waterways can be a good topic for a vacation.
For example, visiting the castles in the Loire or Rhine Valley, cruising through interesting cities on the Danube, or sailing along the Erie Canal.
They also map out routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many traditions characteristic for this holiday have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
As usual, Easter night is spent in some open place in order to witness the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian fertility ritual in honor of the arrival of spring.
In more traditional churches, the Easter Vigil often takes place on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, and communities begin the celebration of Christ's resurrection when the clock strikes midnight.
Most animals originally came to the islands by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals could not reach the islands, so the giant tortoise became the main survivor on the Galapagos.
Since man arrived on the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic region in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not appear above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the northern lights because the sky will be more or less constantly dark.
Since the areas are rarely inhabited and light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is significantly more hierarchically-oriented and formal than what Westerners are used to.
At the workplace, people wear suits, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job position.
Unity in the workplace is crucial - the focus is on collective effort, not celebrating individual achievements.
Workers must often seek approval from their superiors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
