This not only confirms the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides information that is not normally obtainable from studying fossils, such as about the color and three-dimensional spatial arrangement of feathers.
Scientists say that the fur of this animal was chestnut-brown on top and had a pale or red-yellow shade on the underside.
This discovery allows for a better understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Because the first dinosaurs did not have a well-developed tail - feathers, but had other features such as whiskers and beards, researchers concluded that it was likely a late evolutionary change compared to other features.
By analyzing the structure of the feather, it can be concluded that it was not used for flying, but rather to regulate temperature or attract attention. Researchers suggested that despite being a young dinosaur's tail, the patterns can be seen as adult plumage rather than chick fluff.
Researchers believe that, although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the patterns can be seen as the feathers of an adult animal, not the down of a young bird.

Yesterday Martel led to the swearing-in of a new time election council, which consists of nine members.
This is already the fifth time that the electoral council of Marta has been elected in four years.
The presidential commission last month recommended the early dissolution of the Central Election Commission as one of many measures to prepare the country for new elections.
During the mass anti-government protests that began in October, Martelly responded with a commission.
The reason for the protest actions, which were sometimes stormy and fierce, was the absence of elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.

The number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent from 2008 (according to a survey of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election).
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Julia Gillard, acting Prime Minister, announced that in her opinion, towards the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign, Australia should become a republic.
This opinion is shared by 34 percent of survey participants. They want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
The most radical views were expressed by 29% of the respondents, who believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and another 31% who, on the contrary, are of the opinion that this should never happen.

The amount of transportation is not increasing, and surface tractors will not stop at "Wembley", moreover, there is no parking for cars at ground level, as well as parking interceptors.
The likelihood of forced playing behind closed doors without fans increased, because it is possible that there is not enough transportation available.
The formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador is described in a study published in the journal "Science" on Thursday.
According to the researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden), the evolution of the new species occurred in just two generations, although it was previously believed that this process would take much longer. The emergence of the new species became possible due to the crossbreeding of the endemic ground finch (Geospiza fortes) with the related cactus ground finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be shaped into various forms. It can be rolled into thin sheets.
You can pull it into a thin wire, which can then be easily twisted and woven. Additionally, you can also unravel it or roll it into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It could be so thin that at times illustrations in books were traced with it - so-called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH level of a certain chemical substance. You can make such an acid-base indicator from red cabbage juice on your own.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the level of acidity or alkalinity of a specific substance.
The pH level in a chemical study is determined based on the quantity of hydrogen ions (denoted by the letter "H" in pH).
The ion of hydrogen represents a proton that has lost its electron (as is known, a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix these two dry powders in a circular motion until they combine into a single whole, and then use wet hands to form them into a ball.
The willow on your hands reacts to external stimuli, creating a strange sensation. At the same time, a kind of shell is formed.
Almost every home in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
In the Greek cities of Knossos and Santorini, which belong to the Minoan period, the remnants of sewage systems were found.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman Empire, toilets were sometimes installed in public baths where women and men were together.
You are using a calling card when you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away from you.
In space, the astronaut answers the call, after which almost immediately reflects it back.
Rockets were used to send the spacecraft into space. Scientists have to use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere refracts light and distorts the image.
For a telescope or spacecraft to reach outer space, a rocket over 100 feet tall is necessary.
The car changed lanes unexpectedly. Easier and quicker movement - that is the biggest thing the car has done for us.
Thanks to him, we have acquired tractors, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below are cats of average size. Their prey is also of average size - they prey on both rodents and antelopes with deer.
In addition to everything, many small predators (including domestic cats roaming freely) catch and eat a lot of small prey - insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the fact that each occupies its niche, that is, has its own unique function, and therefore does not need to compete with other cats.
Lions are one of the most social cats: they live in large groups known as prides.
Pride can consist of up to three adult males who are relatives, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
In most cases, females are close relatives, forming large families with sisters and daughters.
Lion prides and packs of wolves or dogs are similar in many ways. The latter can strongly resemble lions in behavior (but not other big cats) in that they represent a deadly danger to the prey.
The tiger is able to climb (though not so well), leap over long distances, swim, and pull with a force five times stronger than that of a well-trained athlete.
The tiger belongs to the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (the panthera genus). No other big cats, besides these four, can roar.
The roar of a tiger resembles more a sharp and loud speech than the full-bodied roar of a lion.
Ocelots use small animals as food. If possible, they hunt monkeys, rodents, snakes, and birds. Almost all the animals they prey on are significantly smaller than ocelots.
Scientists believe that cheetahs hunt and find their prey by following and sniffing out tracks on the ground.
Thanks to their excellent vision, they can see well in the darkness and move very confidently. They are stealthy, blending in with the surrounding environment and ambushing their prey from their hiding place.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) separates from the main population they originated from (for example, when moving through a river or mountain range or when such living organisms migrate to a new island, so that returning to them will be quite difficult), they often find themselves in an environment that is significantly different from the place they came from.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so in order to become a strong competitor oneself, the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations compared to those it had before.
The original population has not changed at all: it still needs to adapt.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, the animals less and less resemble the main population from which they separated.
Thousands or even millions of years will pass, and sooner or later the two mentioned populations will look so different that no one will think to classify them as the same species.
This process we call speciation, which actually means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result and a very important stage of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe. In addition, they use carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants "feed" themselves with sunlight through photosynthesis. In addition, they provide shade.
We get our food and produce from plants. We mainly eat plants. And animals wouldn't survive without plants either.
During their time, dinosaurs were apex predators, so they were afraid of nothing and no one, except for other dinosaurs.
On his long canines, there were over 70 sharp as razors teeth, and in the upper part of the mouth, there was one additional row. This meant that his prey would have no chance of escaping.
It is not exactly known, but it is possible that he had a split tongue. The diet of mosasaurs consisted of large fish, turtles, and other mosasaurs. It is likely that they also could have eaten members of their own species.
Apart from that, he feasted on everything that fell into the water; his appetite was not even worthy of such a giant as the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Despite the fact that their food mainly did not surprise us, some dishes were, to put it mildly, unusual. Among them - wild, beaver, snails and one of the rodents, known as a beaver-eating pig.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting in chairs, the wealthy held banquets where they would eat and rest at the same time.
The range of foods prepared in Ancient Rome did not include products that had arrived in Europe from America or Asia at a later date.
They did not have, in particular, neither potatoes, nor tomatoes, nor corn, nor cocoa. It is also necessary to add that not a single ancient Roman ever had the opportunity to taste turkey.
The inhabitants of Babylon built a main temple for each of their gods, which they considered his home.
Believers brought offerings to their deities, and the priests tried to satisfy their needs by performing various sacred rites and ceremonies in their honor.
In each temple there was an open inner courtyard and a sanctuary where only priests could visit.
In some cases, special towers resembling pyramids were erected during the construction of temples. They were known as ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In a warm climate, the house of the Near East did not have much significance.
From the majority, the life of a Jewish family took place in the fresh air.
Women were cooking outside; the stores were simply open stalls facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
In Canaan, there were no dense forests, which is why timber had great value.
The territory of Greenland was not densely populated. According to Scandinavian sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while sailing west he came across Greenland, which he called "Green Land".
But regardless of its discovery, the Eskimos had already been living there at that time.
There were many differences between the peoples, kings, traditions, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, despite the fact that each of these countries was "Scandinavian".
If you have watched the movie "National Treasure", you might think that there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this does not match reality. Despite something being truly written on the back of the document, this is not a treasure map.
The reverse side of the Declaration of Independence, on the other hand, was written: "The initial version of the Declaration of Independence from July 4, 1776". The text in reverse can be found at the bottom of the document.
Who wrote it, no one knows exactly, but it is known that the large parchment document (29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was folded at the beginning of its existence for preservation.
It may well be that this record was added there just as a note.
Thanks to the landing in Normandy and subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the southern part of the country was still under occupation.
He was under the authority of the "Vichy regime". These were the French who in 1940 made peace with the Germans and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting against them.
on August 15, 1940, Operation "Dragoon" began - the allies landed in southern France.
The Americans and the forces of "Free France" liberated the southern territories of France in just two weeks, after which they headed towards Germany.
Civilization is the common culture of a fairly large group of people who work and live together in society.
The above-mentioned term "civilization" comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning "civil." The latter is similar in meaning to the Latin noun civis, i.e. "citizen," as well as to the noun civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state." All this, in turn, says something about the size of the society.
States-civilizations are the predecessors of nations. Civilization culture implies the transmission of knowledge through generations, equal distribution, and a sustainable cultural impact.
Small cultures are often not considered civilizations in the full sense of the word, because they disappear without leaving significant historical evidence behind.
During the War for Independence, thirteen states initially established a weak central government in accordance with the Articles of Confederation of the thirteen states. Only the Congress was included in this government.
Congress did not have the authority to introduce taxes and, since there was no national executive and judicial authority, it sought to ensure compliance with all laws with the support of state bodies, which were often not inclined to cooperate.
Apart from that, he lacked the authority to repeal the tax laws and tariffs introduced by the states.
According to the Treaty on the establishment of a confederation, any changes required unanimous consent of all states, and the states did not take the central government seriously enough that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, just like the German national team, holds the second place among the strongest national teams in the world. In 2006, it won the FIFA World Cup.
Football, basketball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, water polo, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing are among the popular sports here.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, while Italians participate in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan is located on almost 7000 islands, the largest of which is Honshu Island. Thanks to this, Japan ranks 7th in the world among the largest islands.
Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographic perspective because it represents a cluster or group of islands.
The history of Taiwan began in the 15th century. It was at that time that its name was recorded by European sailors passing by as "Formosa" – which meant "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the territory of southwestern Taiwan and initiated the reform of primitive agricultural practices. The company hired Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) captured western and northern Taiwanese territories in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government concluded the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, according to which Japan was given sovereignty over the island, and it remained under Japanese control until 1945.
The Machu Picchu complex includes three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Tourists could get a better idea of how most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex originally looked, the last ones were rebuilt.
30 percent of Machu Picchu was restored by 1976. Restoration work is ongoing until now.
Yes, the most popular format for still photography in the world is the 35mm format. During the era of analog photography, this film format was predominant.
Such film is produced now, however, what is more important, its width and height ratios are now used in digital camera matrix formats.
This may deviate a little from the original point, but in fact, the 35mm format is 36mm wide and 24mm tall.
Accordingly, it is considered that the aspect ratio for this format (after dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers) is 3:2.
Such or similar relationships between sides have many common formats (for example, APS format families).
The rule of expenses, often subjected to criticism and ridicule, represents simple tips that ensure dynamism while maintaining a certain degree of order in the image.
If you trust him, the best place to position the key subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the photograph into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the activities of the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, came under close scrutiny.
Despite all the linguistic and cultural differences that existed, the Christian religion united European countries for over a thousand years.
All - from the king to the common people - were under its all-encompassing power.
The essence of one of the main dogmas of Christianity lies in the use of wealth to reduce suffering and ease hardships, and that exactly for this purpose there are financial means of the church.
For over a thousand years, the central church authorities were located in Rome. Because of this concentration of power and money, many question whether this doctrine is being upheld.
Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the start of hostilities.
The embargo on the supply of vital military and civilian goods, although it violates universally recognized international law, which has been reinforced by several international agreements at the legislative level over the past two centuries, has proven to be an effective strategy.
Great Britain has replaced international waters so that ships could not enter certain areas of the ocean. Thus, it has posed a danger even to neutral vessels.
Due to the lack of significant reaction to this tactic, Germany deemed that unlimited submarine warfare would also not be opposed.
Among most of the citizens and countries during the 1920s, there were prevailing moods of pacifism and isolation.
Countries and peoples have vowed to avoid such a situation in the future, as they have already witnessed the horrors and atrocities during the First World War.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 because he found a job at the company "Edison" located in New York.
Four cents in total, a collection of poems and a recommendation letter to Thomas Edison, written by Charles Bachelor (his manager from a previous job), were in his pocket when he arrived in the USA.
In ancient China, unique methods were used to mark different epochs. At every stage of China's history, or in every family in power, distinct dynasties existed.
In addition, the periods of rule of the dynasties were divided into periods of separate provinces, when there was instability. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
Many of the rulers who fought for the throne carried out ruthless military actions among themselves during the mentioned periods.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the Three Kingdoms period: thousands of people died in the struggle for the opportunity to occupy the highest position in the great palace in Xi'an.
The French Revolution had many social and political consequences. Among them - the transition from absolutism to a republican system of governance, the introduction of the metric system, the emergence of nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs not to a single ruler, but to the whole people.
Furthermore, various positions became available to all male candidates after the Revolution, resulting in the advancement of the most successful and ambitious.
In the army, the same thing happened, because earlier military ranks were assigned based on nobility, but now they are based on abilities and skills.
In addition, the French Revolution inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the boundaries of worldly life. To meditate and contemplate, he often visited a cave on Mount Nur (translated as "light"), known as "Hira".
The very cave that endured the test of time gives a very vivid idea of the spiritual principles of Muhammad.
The cave is completely isolated from the outside world - it is located on the top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca.
In fact, it is very difficult to find it, even if someone knows about its existence. Inside the cave, you are in complete isolation.
From the depths of the clean and beautiful skies above and the many surrounding mountains, nothing can be seen. Very little of this world can be seen and felt from a cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has survived to our times.
The Great Pyramid is one of the many pyramids that were built to honor the memory of the pharaoh-god. It was constructed in the third century BC.
On the plateau of Giza, also known as the "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), a number of smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The construction of the Great Pyramid was dedicated to the memory of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, temples, and tombs were dedicated to the wives and family members of the pharaoh.
The sign that indicates the upward movement looks like "V", and the downward movement looks like a bracket or a square without the bottom side.
"Movement of the lever upwards" means that you should start the movement from the end of the lever and lead it up, and "movement of the lever downwards" means that you should start from the fulcrum (this is the place where your hand holds the lever) and lead the lever down.
Movement upwards usually produces a softer sound, while downwards is stronger and more confident.
You can place your notes in pencil, but do not forget that the printed symbols stand there not just because, but with a certain musical purpose, so they usually need to be preserved.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (4-year-old Louis-Charles and 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse), as well as Madame Élisabeth, the king's sister, had to return from Versailles to Paris because of a crowd of women.
The royal family was taken to Paris by carriage. Along the way, they were surrounded by a crowd - people hissed, lamented, and shouted threats at the king and queen.
The king and queen had to open the carriage windows under the pressure of the crowd.
At a certain moment, someone from the crowd waved to the queen, who was already terrified, with the head of a slain guard from Versailles.
The military expenses of the US imperialists, which were incurred in connection with the conquest of the Philippines, had to be paid by the Filipinos themselves.
To pay a significant portion of the expenses and interest on bonds that were placed through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Filipino government, they had to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States.
Undoubtedly, the main achievement of the US imperialists would be the surplus brought by the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people.
To imagine who the Templars were, it is necessary to understand well what were the prerequisites for the creation of the order.
The era when these events took place is traditionally called the Classical Middle Ages - this is a period in the history of Europe that covers the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
At first came the Early Middle Ages, followed by the High Middle Ages, and after it - the Late Middle Ages. The latter, as is commonly considered, ended around 1500.
The term "technological determinism" refers to a whole range of practical ideas, from the emphasis on promoting certain technologies or the technical necessity for a precise understanding of the fact that human destiny is conditioned by the logic on which scientific laws are based and their embodiment in the field of technology.
Two common ideas are characteristic of most interpretations of technological determinism: the development of technologies largely goes beyond cultural or political influence, and technologies, in turn, have their own (rather than socially conditioned) impact on societies.
In privacy, there is a belief that the use of cars stimulates road development.
However, if the number of cars is small, the national network of roads does not make economic sense. Therefore, the development of new methods of production that allow for a reduction in the cost of car ownership is being conducted.
Due to the large number of car owners, the number of road accidents is increasing. This, in turn, leads to the development of new methods in the field of healthcare, which allow for the treatment of various injuries.
The iron element of cultural determinism, which influenced the works of writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel, was characteristic of Romanticism.
When talking about the Romantic era, geography had a strong influence on people's presence. Over time, traditions and culture related to it emerged. They were better than the laws introduced by force, as they existed in harmony with the place and position occupied by society.
During medieval times, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of Europe while Paris is considered the modern capital of fashion.
Around 400 AD, the city becomes known as a center of luxury and maintains this status until almost 1100 AD.
In the 12th century, its status as a center of luxury and riches was established. This was mainly due to the return of the Crusaders with gifts, among which were spices and silk, which were highly valued, much higher than what was offered in the markets of Byzantium.
At that time, Constantinople relinquished the title of fashion capital to Paris.
The heyday of the Gothic style fell on the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as the 14th century.
The Eastern Byzantine culture initially had a strong influence on the style of clothing.
However, western styles can be delayed by 25-30 years due to the slow communication channels.
Western Europe began to develop its own style by the end of the Middle Ages. The fact that people began to use buttons to fasten clothing as a result of the Crusades became one of the most significant events of that time.
In natural agriculture, such a quantity of food products is produced that exclusively meets the needs of the farmer and his family.
Natural farming represents a simple and usually organic system. It is based on the use of local seeds preserved in a certain ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other uncomplicated methods. The aim of all this is to achieve maximum fertility.
Many farmers historically practiced traditional agriculture. Many third world countries still practice this.
Subcultures bring together people with similar views who feel marginalized in terms of social norms and allow them to develop a sense of uniqueness within themselves.
Age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender can be notable features of subcultures.
The identification of a particular subculture can be based on different factors - linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or their combinations.
Members of the same subculture often define their belonging to it through noticeable and symbolic style in clothing, behavior, and slang.
As an illustration of what socialization is and how important it is, examples with children who have not been brought up in an atmosphere of disrespect, neglect, various hardships or humiliation and whom adults have not socialized in childhood are most often given.
Such children are called "wild". Some "wild" children have been in captivity for a long time (usually their own parents treated them this way); in some cases, the lack of parental care was the result of the parents' unwillingness to acknowledge serious physical or intellectual disorders and deficiencies in the child.
Before they were abandoned or fled, feral children could experience serious abuse or trauma.
Others, it is said, were raised by animals; reportedly, some lived independently in the wild.
When a child is raised entirely by animals, their behavior almost entirely (excluding physical limitations) reflects the behavior of the animal care provider: for example, such a child may be afraid of people or indifferent to them.
The goal of project-based learning is to make the learning process easier and more interesting, and scaffolding in this regard goes even further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method but rather a tool that helps people gain new experience in learning. This can mean using new computer programs or starting a new project.
Assistants can be both real and virtual. For example, assistants can be both a teacher and a small feature in the "Microsoft Office" program.
Virtual assistants are provided in the software to ask questions, provide guidance and explain procedures for students or listeners to understand independently.
There are many reasons why children can end up in foster families. This can be abuse, neglect, and even coercion.
Children should not be allowed to grow up in an environment where no one cares for them, raises them, or educates them, but this still happens.
In our view, the foster care system provides a safe space for such children.
It is believed that thanks to our system of foster families, foster children will have reliable medical care, safe homes, kind and caring caregivers, and a stable education.
It is believed that the foster family must meet all the needs of the child that were not satisfied at the home from which the child was taken.
The Internet serves as a means not only for mass communication, but also for interagency relations.
Thanks to the unique characteristics of the Internet, there are additional opportunities for its use and meeting the needs of the audience.
Yes, for example, the opinion is expressed that such concepts as "education" and "socialization" are difficult themes to use the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The concepts of "personal involvement" and "stable relationships" were also identified by Eimy and McCordam (1998) as new aspects of motivation when studying the audience's reaction to internet websites.
Thanks to the video recording, important discoveries have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions - it should be taken into account the movements of facial muscles, which last only a few milliseconds.
It is argued, among other things, that the correct interpretation of microexpressions can help to determine whether a person is lying or telling the truth.
In his work "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks noted how people with brain damage, not understanding the speech itself, can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests the idea that animals - for example, domestic dogs - may also be able to accurately interpret human behavior.
The results of 20th century research indicate that there are two pools of genetic variability, namely, manifest and hidden variations.
Under the influence of mutation, new genetic variations arise, and they are removed from the pool of detected through selection.
With each subsequent generation, segregation and recombination shuffle the variations in these two pools.
In the savannah, the available plant resources cannot satisfy the needs of animals in amino acids when their digestive system is similar to humans.
Moreover, if they fail to do so, the consequences can be serious. It is both dissatisfaction, and depression of growth, and inevitable death.
The most accessible plant resources would be nuts, which can be found in beans and leaves. However, if they are not properly prepared, they are difficult for the bodies of such primates like us to digest.
Across the street, the food of animal origin (ants, termites, caterpillars) provides the body with a large amount of protein, rich in all necessary amino acids and at the same time is easily absorbed.
Thinking everything over, it's not worth being surprised if it turns out that our ancestors solved their own "protein problem" almost the same way as the chimpanzees in the savanna do nowadays.
Under the interruption of sleep, deliberate awakening of a sleeping person during the process of normal sleep and falling asleep again after a short period of time (from 10 to 60 minutes) should be considered.
It is possible to achieve this with the help of a silent alarm clock that will wake you up but not completely.
If you find yourself constantly translating the clock in your sleep, try putting it at the other end of the room. This way, you will have to get out of bed to turn it off.
According to other variants based on biorhythms, it is necessary to consume a lot of fluid before sleep (primarily water or tea, a well-known soothing agent) - this forces a person to get up at night to urinate.
The internal peace of a person is directly proportional to the tension of his body and spirit.
Life force becomes more stable the lower the tension. Absolute calm and satisfaction are available to everyone.
Enlightenment can be achieved by everyone. The only obstacle on this path is our own negativity and tension.
The foundation of Tibetan Buddhism lies in the teachings of Buddha, which were supplemented through the influence of Mahayana love and a series of methodologies from Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It combines meditation, Kundalini yoga, and love for all humanity.
Followers of Kundalini yoga claim that to awaken the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment), one must practice certain yoga poses, mantras, and visualizations, as well as perform breathing exercises.
Tibetan yoga is the main part of the practice of Tibetan meditation. Visualization of various deities allows to purify the energy channels, open chakras and attain enlightened consciousness.
During the Second World War, Germany was a common enemy, thanks to which the USSR and the USA became allies. After the end of the war, systemic, industrial, and cultural conflicts led to a quarrel between the countries.
Two years after the end of the combat operations, a cold war begins - former allies turn into enemies.
She lasted for the next 40 years and was really fought by the armies of friendly countries. Battles took place in different regions - from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defense was broken by September 17, 1939. Retreat and regrouping along the Romanian positions remained the only hope.
Nevertheless, all these plans lost their sense in just one night, as over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army in the composition of the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts entered the territory of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Shipping goods by ship is usually the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and cargo across the oceans.
Traditionally, the task of the military-naval forces was set so that their country could be able to transport people and goods, and at the same time, the enemy could not transport their own people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War became one of the most significant examples of this idea. With the aim of helping Great Britain, the Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop the mentioned movement, mainly using submarines for this.
Germany, probably, could have conquered Great Britain in the same way it conquered the rest of Europe if the allies had not failed.
It seems that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros mountains in Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Representatives of ancient cultures and tribes began breeding them to always have milk, wool, meat, and hides at hand.
Usually home goats grazed in the estates that roamed on the hills or other meadows. Often they were looked after by the household - children or teenagers. The latter acted as shepherds. This is how animals are still grazed in our time.
In the 16th century, England had already built highways.
Although the wooden roads may seem like nothing more than parallel wooden planks, they allowed horse-drawn vehicles to move faster and carry heavier loads than on the existing uneven roads.
The sleepers were used to maintain the rails in place quite early. However, after some time it became clear that movement on the rails would be more effective if they were covered with an iron plate.
This practice has become widespread, but due to the presence of iron, the wooden wheels of the wagons wore out faster.
After some time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. The first fully metal wheels appeared in 1767.
The first known means of transportation was walking. Two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means "upright man"), people began to walk in a vertical position.
Australopithecus, their predecessors, usually didn't walk upright.
Primitive Australopithecus individuals were found in fossils, the age of which is 4.2-3.9 million years, however it is quite possible that seven million years ago Sahelanthropus already walked on two legs.
One can become more aware of the surrounding environment, participate in the ecological movement, or even become an activist so that in the future these problems do not become very strong.
Often it looks more like symptomatic treatment. However, if we need not just a temporary solution, then we must find and destroy the root of the problem.
It is well known that thanks to technological and scientific advancements, the world has significantly changed. As a result of overpopulation and wasteful lifestyles, the number of problems for people has increased.
After the declaration was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten copy, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was delivered to printer John Dunlap, located a few blocks away.
The nightly journey cost 150 to 200 kopecks, now known as "Arkushy Danlapa."
On July 8, John Nixon publicly read this document for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
On July 6, George Washington received one of the directives he read to his troops in New York on July 9. Another directive was received in London on August 10.
By now only 25 of the first printed copies of the Declaration of Independence (known as the Dunlap broadsides) have survived. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs managed to survive and that it even still exists today, we just call them birds.
Because of their feathers and ability to fly, many people do not consider them dinosaurs.
But birds still have many common features with dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and, like the T-Rex, walk on two hind legs.
Practically all modern computers perform operations with encoded in binary form information.
The storage of binary numbers can have only one of two values - 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or (in computer jargon) bits.
Internal bleeding may not have obvious symptoms. For example, vomiting is a fairly common symptom, which makes it impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
The presence of open containers with pills or toxic household chemicals may indicate internal poisoning.
Instructions for administering emergency medical assistance for this specific poison must be checked on the label.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in a formal sense to designate this group of insects.
This term emerged because people have long known what bed bugs are - these insects that are highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Like the barn swallows, bed bugs are also parasitic, they are accustomed to living in nests or in the house of their host.
Around 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been registered in the United States of America. Accordingly, this neurological disease is a major among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system. This includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Based on the research results, it was found that women suffer from PTSD twice as often as men.
The couple may come to the conclusion that raising a baby does not meet their interests or the interests of the child they already have.
Such couples can give their child up for adoption.
When the natural parents are reinstated, the child renounces their parental rights so that other guardians can raise and nurture them.
The main goal of science is to elucidate, through the scientific method, the way the world functions. In fact, the majority of scientific research is conducted using this method.
There exists, however, not only him. An experiment (this is a test that is conducted to eliminate one or several possible hypotheses by asking questions and observations) also guides and stimulates scientific research.
Philosophers and naturalists paid the most attention to classical texts. In particular, they spoke about the Bible in Latin.
According to common beliefs at the time, Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were considered generally accepted.
When the number of people who were fluent in the Greek language decreased, the West found itself detached from its scientific and philosophical roots.
Many rhythms observed in the behavior and physiology of animals depend to a large extent on the presence of endogenous cycles. The latter arise as a result of the functioning of the biological clock.
In the majority of living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, periodic rhythms have been documented that are not a direct response to external periodic signals.
The biological clock is an autonomous process. Even when external signals are not received, the process continues as independent free-running cycles.
One of the main hypotheses, which claimed that DNA is genetic material, was tested during the Hershey and Chase experiment.
For the implantation of their own DNA into the bacteria, Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled the DNA of a bacteriophage with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of a bacteriophage with a radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the size of the genetic material fragment in which the mutation occurred, and whether the mutated cells are closely related to the embryonic line, mutations can have a variety of consequences.
Inheritable can only be mutations in germ cells. The result of other mutations can be cell death or cancer.
Eco-tourism attracts those people who are interested in visiting various natural areas and territories, because they want to enjoy the overall view and landscape, including observing the flora and fauna.
As an example of what can be done in nature, fishing, hunting, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystems can be mentioned.
As an example, you can mention visiting, studying, and photographing orangutans on the island of Borneo.
People from small provincial towns drive out in their cars every morning to go to work. Along the way, they pass by other people who work there and have only just arrived.
In this dynamic transportation circle, everyone has some connection to the privately owned vehicle transportation system and supports it.
Scientific data indicates that the modern high-carbon economy has disrupted the stability of the biosphere, which has greatly contributed to the evolution of humans over the past two million years.
Transport systems are used by all people who participate in society's life. And almost all of them are dissatisfied with these transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear so many complaints about the lack of green spaces or water quality.
Why are transportation systems a constant source of such complaints, why do they regularly stop working? Is the reason the lack of competent transportation engineers? Or is something more significant happening?
The term "traffic movement" implies the analysis of the movement of individual vehicles and transport vehicles between two points, as well as the study of how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, studying the traffic flows is a complex problem, as it is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with absolute certainty.
The Kirowtsy, fortunately, usually behave quite consistently; therefore, as a rule, transport flows are characterized by a certain rational sequence and can be approximately described using mathematical models.
To provide a more complete and clear representation of what constitutes the movement of vehicles, three main parameters related to each other were established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
The presence of these links helps to plan and design road objects, as well as to engage in their operation.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. The ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more effectively, as well as find partners and food.
In most cases, the wings of insects are located along the body.
Thanks to this, they can hide in very small places to escape from predators.
Dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects today that cannot fold their wings.
One man, named Aristarchus, claimed several thousand years ago that the Solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many supported the idea that the Solar System (including the Sun and other stars) revolves around the Earth.
It sounds reasonable, because being on Earth, it's hard to argue whether it moves or not, right?
The Amazon River ranks second in length among all other rivers on Earth and is the largest of them. The volume of water in it is 8 times greater than in the river that ranks second.
The widest river on Earth is the Amazon, sometimes its width reaches six miles.
The Amazon is the source of at least 20 percent of all the water that enters the oceans from the planet's rivers.
The Amazon River, into which waters from thousands of smaller rivers flow, has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles).
Although the construction of pyramids using stones continued until the end of the Old Kingdom era, in terms of size and technical excellence of construction, no one has ever been able to exceed the pyramids of Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were amazed by the monuments built by their ancestors, the age of which at that time exceeded a thousand years.
In Vatican City, there are only about 800 people living. It is the smallest independent country in the world with the smallest population.
In legislation and official communications, the Vatican uses the Italian language.
The majority of those working in the public sector use Italian as their everyday language, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City belong to the Roman Catholic Church.
Thanks to the fact that the main chemical elements (such as gold, silver, and copper) occur in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools, people have known about them since ancient times.
Philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that asserted that all things are made up of one element or a combination of the four elements (earth, water, fire, and air).
It looked more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although, according to his theory, they can also transform into other states of matter to become what we observe.
In most cases, an alloy is a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains a large number of elements.
The elements similar to calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also such metals as silver and gold.
In addition, there are alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic components. Such non-metallic components can include, for example, carbon.
The material is made entirely in Switzerland. All material is made up of tiny particles - atoms.
The number of atoms is so small that they can fit trillions into the dot at the end of this sentence.
As a result, when the bear appeared, he became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the significance of the pen and the frequency of its use have decreased with the emergence of new writing methods.
People in our time write messages on computer screens, and no one needs a typewriter.
We can only speculate what fate awaits the keyboard when it is replaced by something fundamentally new.
The principle of operation of a plutonium bomb is the use of nuclear fusion energy, when a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons is formed.
This is like a cat pulling a very heavy cart uphill. Repeated nuclear fission will release a portion of this energy.
The cores of some atoms are unstable. This means that they have a tendency to break down with little external influence or even without it.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called regolith.
The distance to the nearest shore is about 70 km, and to the far shore is about 100 km.
Under the monthly illusions, the Moon's shadow is thinner, and under the high hills - thicker.
The lunar tides can be stronger on the nearest side of the moon to us, because there is a thicker crust, and, consequently, it was easier to rise to the surface.
Relevant theories focus on what guides people or attracts them.
The mentioned theories come from the fact that people have certain needs and/or desires, which they transform into internal ones and give them a subjective character (in other words, internalize) during the attitude.
The mentioned theories describe what exactly motivates individual people to desire what they do and what factors in their environment can influence whether they will do certain things.
"The theory of needs hierarchy" by Maslow and "Two-factor theory" by Herzberg are two authoritative substantive theories.
In essence, when leaders reconnect with their former colleagues, two types of behavior may arise. At one end of the spectrum, there will be attempts to remain "one of the guys" (or "one of the girls").
Managers dealing with this type may face difficulties in assessing work effectiveness, making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, accountability allocation and holding guilty parties accountable.
Another extreme is when a person changes beyond recognition - they feel the need to change everything that the team has done before, and take credit for it.
In the end, the responsibility for the success and failure of the team lies directly on the leader.
Often, such behavior ends in quarrels between leaders and other team members.
The standards of excellence for regular commands should be followed by virtual commands, but there are some minor differences.
Virtual team members usually perform the role of a contact center for the corresponding real group.
Taking into account that such teams can meet regardless of time zones, they often have more freedom than members of traditional teams, which may be unclear to local management.
Another unique component of effective virtual teaming is the presence of a genuine "invisible leadership." (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
A team of leaders, to which each member is subordinate, is called a "high-performance team". It sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of forming an educational institution? Innovation is one of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts in practice.
Creativity and efficiency can be demonstrated when all available resources are effectively used in the functional departments of the organization.
In this way, the process used by an organization, the employees of which are trying to collectively overcome some obstacle, can lead to the emergence of a new innovative process that satisfies customer needs.
The organization's leadership should create a culture characterized by openness, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning. Only after that, the organization can be called innovative.
In "Angel" (2006), the continuous approach represents a method by which organizations can achieve greater efficiency.
Theoretical approach to the study is supported by physical evidence in the form of neurobiological data. Thus, the research area is narrowed down and becomes more accurate.
The results of the research obtained by scientists confirm the close relationship between brain pathologies and human behavior.
It has long been known that various types of cranial-brain injuries, focal lesions, formations, plaques, pathological changes, and brain tumors affect behavior and alter some mental functions.
The development of new technologies makes it possible to study the structure of the brain and previously unknown processes in it.
Thanks to this, we receive a massive amount of materials and data to build simulation models, which in turn help us understand the processes that occur in our minds.
Although the term "artificial intelligence" usually evokes associations with science fiction, in fact AI is a very important field of computer science that deals with studying behavior, learning processes, and intellectual adaptation of computers.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence includes attempts to force machines to automate tasks that require machines to behave intelligently.
As an example, planning and control, the ability to respond to customer requests and technical problems, as well as recognizing faces, voices, and handwriting can be mentioned.
They are specialized in separate disciplines that study real-life problems and propose solutions for them.
In our time, the Chernobyl exclusion zone is often used in the economy, medicine, technical and military fields. Additionally, it is a component of the software for some computer programs and video games.
Excursions make up a significant part of school education. Often, the teacher takes students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
With the help of modern technology, virtual excursions can be organized. Students can familiarize themselves with museum exhibits, visit an aquarium or admire the beauty of works of art. And all this - without leaving the classroom.
Participating in virtual tours is also a very good way to think about travel and share experiences with future activities.
Students at Bennett School in North Carolina, for example, annually create a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year they update it, but old versions remain in the network in the form of an album.
In addition, blogging can improve students' written language. Although at the beginning of blogging, their grammar and spelling often "limp", it usually changes for the better, thanks to the audience.
Taking into account that students are usually the most critical audience, the blogger does everything possible to improve their style in order to avoid criticism.
Apart from that, blogging "helps students better understand the world around them." Maintaining the audience's interest inspires them and forces them to remain capable and interesting (Tota, 2004).
Blogging contributes to cooperation and encourages students to learn much more than traditional school approaches offer.
If students use blogs properly, they "will be able to develop skills of analytical and critical thinking; active response to Internet materials will help students to outline their own position to what has been written by other people as well as express their own views on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is an interesting and charming bilingual capital of Canada. Here you can find numerous art galleries and museums, which provide an opportunity to get acquainted with the country's past and present.
The Niagara Falls lies further to the south, and to the north there is Lake Muskoka, famous for its unspoiled natural beauty.
For that reason, and for many other reasons, tourists, visitors, and other foreigners consider Ontario a typical Canadian province.
In significant parts of its territory, which are further to the north, there are very few people living, and some areas are almost like deserted wilderness.
It may be surprising to compare populations by the following fact: the number of African Americans in the USA exceeds the total population of citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located near the eastern coast of Africa and belong to the islands of the Indian Ocean.
Undoubtedly, Madagascar is the largest of them. When talking about the wildlife, it can be compared to a separate continent.
Almost all islands of a smaller size are either independent states or belong to France. They are famous for their luxurious beach resorts.
Apart from that, the Arabs brought Islam to these lands, and this religion quickly spread to the Comoros islands and the island of Mayotte.
By the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route to India from Europe around the Cape of Good Hope, it marked the beginning of European influence and colonialism.
The northern border of this region is the Sahel, and the southern and western border is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: female tourists are always recommended to say that they are married, even if they are not.
Apart from that, you may find it useful to wear a ring (so that it does not look too expensive).
Women need to understand that as a result of cultural differences, they may encounter behaviors that amount to harassment. Local residents often bother tourists, grab them by the hands, and so on.
. Refuse men assertively and stand up for your opinion boldly (regardless of cultural differences, this is absolutely unacceptable!).
In the 10th century BC, the modern Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen. Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used this city as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city, and then rebuilt it again under the name Casa Branca (White House). After the earthquake of 1755, they abandoned this place.
The Sultan of Marrakech rebuilt the city and named it Dar al-Badzzya. The name Casablanca was given to the city by Spanish merchants who established trade bases there.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping.
In the Old Town of Minsk, you can easily find places where traditional Moroccan products are sold - products made of leather, pottery, carpets, hookahs, and various trinkets, but all of them are intended exclusively for tourists.
Goma is a city in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo near the border with Rwanda, which is popular among tourists.
In 2002, the city of Goma was covered with lava from the Nyiragongo volcano. It buried a significant portion of the city streets, especially in the city center.
Despite the fact that the city of Goma itself is relatively safe, it is worth conducting a small investigation before venturing beyond its boundaries to find out whether there are ongoing military operations in the North Kivu province.
Besides that, the city serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano. Here, very detailed services are also offered for amateur mountain watchers - the most attractive prices in Africa are difficult to find.
To get to Goma, you can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The standard (local) price for a short trip is around 500 Congolese francs.
As a result of the comparative inaccessibility of Timbuktu, its name began to be used as a metaphor to refer to distant exotic places.
Despite its tourist reputation and the presence of an airport, Timbuktu today is a city of poverty.
In 1990, due to the threat from the desertification, it was included in the list of world heritage sites under threat.
Henry Louis Gates devoted a lot of attention to this city in the PBS program "Wonders of the African Continent".
In comparison to other cities in the country, the city stands out even more because it has more of an Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (NPK) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa. In the east it borders Mozambique, in the north - Zimbabwe, and the Crocodile River forms its southern boundary.
The area of the park is 19,500 km². There are 14 ecosystems in it, each of which is home to different animals and plants.
He imagines one of the most interesting places in the country, as well as being the most significant of the National Parks of Southern Africa.
As in all national parks of the Republic of South Africa, the park charges an entrance fee and enforce an environmental levy on visitors every day.
Apart from that, a benefit can be obtained by acquiring the so-called Wild Card - a subscription that gives the right to visit several parks in South Africa or all national parks of South Africa.
The country name Hong Kong is derived from the island of Hong Kong, which is a center of attraction for many tourists.
Beautiful buildings of Hong Kong that form the architectural face of the city are compared to a glittering column chart, and the waters of Victoria Harbor only emphasize its presence.
The best views of Hong Kong can be enjoyed by leaving the island and heading to the opposite located Kowloon waterfront.
A significant portion of Hong Kong's urban development is compactly located along the northern coast on reclaimed land.
In the past, this place was occupied by colonizers from Great Britain, so if you want to see evidence of the colonial past of the country with your own eyes, you should start right here.
The Sundarbans forest is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, it stretches for 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the interior of Bangladesh and the inner part of India.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The portion of the forest located in India is known as the "Sundarbans National Park."
Not only the flooded swamps are called forests, but also some of the last primeval jungles that once covered the Ganges plain and still have been preserved.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², of which water bodies or swamps occupy about one third.
The Sundarbans forest has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and currently, according to reports, there are 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in this region.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (located across the river) throughout the day. However, in most cases they depart between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those heading to the east and to Jakar (located in the Bumtang area).
Tickets are recommended to be purchased a couple of days before the trip due to the frequent overcrowding of intercity buses.
Convenient and reliable small Coaster buses from Japan serve most of the areas.
Route taxis are a comfortable and convenient way to get to nearby places, for example, to the cities of Punakha (fare - 200 ngultrums) and Paro (fare - 150 ngultrums).
The bridge over the Amapá River is impressive. It connects the shores of the Amapá River, where two cities are located - Amapá (Brazil) and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock (French Guiana).
The height of the two pillars is 83 meters. The length of the bridge is 378 meters. The roadway consists of two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Despite the fact that its construction was completed in August 2011, the bridge was only opened for traffic in spring 2017.
According to the schedule, the bridge will become fully functional in September 2017, after the completion of the construction of Brazilian customs checkpoints.
Guaraní, who led a life of semi-nomadic hunters and also engaged in traditional agriculture, were the largest group of indigenous inhabitants who populated the territory of modern Eastern Paraguay.
Other groups of indigenous peoples, such as the Payaguá and Guaicuru, lived in the Chaco region. To survive, they engaged in hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Paraguay, previously known as the "Gigantic Province of the Indies," actually emerged in the 16th century when Spanish conquerors encountered the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a three hundred year period of colonization.
Paraguay managed to preserve its uniqueness and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina prides itself on having one of the best national teams and players in the world.
At the snow-covered fields for polo in Las Canitas, the biggest tournament of the year is taking place.
