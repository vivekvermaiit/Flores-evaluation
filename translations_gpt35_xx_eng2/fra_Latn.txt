This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely spread, but it provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brown chestnut on top and pale or carotenoid in color on the underside.
This discovery also allows for a better understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Given that dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed central shaft, called a rachis, but still show other characteristics unique to feathers - barbs and barbules - researchers have concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have suggested that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not chick down.
The scientists clarify that it is indeed the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a plumage belonging to an adult individual, not a young one.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matters in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is found in a kind of halo, and is made up of a large number of small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put a pre-printed paper indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the agents have verified his identity, the voter casts the envelope into the ballot box and signs his voter card.
The French Electoral Code regulates operations quite strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelope is present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelope is added, except for those of duly counted and authorized voters.
The candidates can send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under high surveillance, according to specific procedures.

Edgar Veguilla was injured in the arm and jaw while Kristoffer Schneider had to undergo reconstructive surgery for his face.
Uka's weapon jammed as it was aimed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers from a stabbing pain, can no longer see out of one eye, has lost part of his skull, and his face has been reconstructed using titanium.
Schneider testified via video link from a USAF base in his country.
Aside from the Wednesday event, Carpanedo participated in two individual races during the Championships.
She first competed in the slalom, where she received a "did not finish" (DNF) in her first race. 36 out of 116 competitors achieved the same result in this race.
Her other race, the giant slalom, allowed her to finish in tenth place in the sitting women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes less than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes less than the ninth-placed Hungarian GyÃ¶ngyi Dani.
In the women's sit-ski category, four skiers did not manage to finish their race; as for the giant slalom, 45 skiers out of a total of 117 in this race failed to classify.
The police of Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya stated: "We have arrested five people for raping the Swiss national, and we have recovered her phone and laptop."
The accused are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police commissioner, declared that the accused persons had their faces covered when they appeared in court.
Although three people were in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed to allow emergency services to extract the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh.
She is being held in custody pending her interrogation and trial, but eyewitness testimonies could be compromised as her portrait has been widely circulated.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system operates differently and the courts considered that the publication of photos could potentially be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, notes that "journalists seem to be following a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects".
The Crown Prosecutor's office, which is in charge of all prosecutions, told the journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will focus on the border dispute that Palestine claims based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Among the other topics discussed are the future State of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a duration of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to a duration of five years.
The shooters in the additional parasite control test had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the test was controlled and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, interim manager of park and heritage conservation at the NPWS, the four designated shooters for the first culling campaign have been duly trained and instructed in safety protocols.
Martelly inaugurated a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth PEC in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a set of measures aimed at steering the country towards new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were supposed to take place in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating faulty iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it had become aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company deemed as "not serious".
The ministry reacted by describing Apple's postponement of the report as "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office declared that no damage had been reported in the country.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has declared that there is no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fires his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and the deaths of at least six of them have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, have been prematurely released, just like the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
He underwent obstetrician training and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births in his free time.
Her research has shown that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate the baby's lung maturation.
The Xinhua agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or "black boxes") on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me... or maybe even more... I love her and she will be missed... I hope she rests in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal elections revealed that the number of opponents to transforming Australia into a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed share this view, and wish for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to reign over Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of those surveyed think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle events and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was called into question.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain, as it is prohibited within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25th the largest known prime number to date.
Several people verified the discovery using various materials and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water supply for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
The scientists hope to understand how planets form, and more specifically how the Earth formed, since comets collided with it a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor at the beginning of this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "chatter and political nonsense".
We think he will run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technologies, rather than the ground-based radar systems previously used, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Extra transportation is nonexistent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and ground parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available.
The fear of a lack of transportation has led to the possibility that the match could be played behind closed doors, without the teams' supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the genesis of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian GalÃ¡pagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden indicated that the new species had evolved in just two generations, although this process was originally estimated to take much longer, following the breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant sharp-beaked finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces.
It can be drawn into fine wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and glued onto another metal. It can be so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is what is called the pH of a chemical product. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical product.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the chemical being tested.
The hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean and wet hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and producing a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with a flush system in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled.
When you call a person who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then sends it back to Earth, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket over 30 meters tall is needed to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest advantage it has brought us is making transportation much simpler and faster.
This brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below are medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free-roaming pet cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called prides.
The packs are composed of one to three related adult males, as well as around thirty females and cubs.
Women are generally very close to each other, their families being made up of a large number of sisters and daughters.
The lion troops act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly for their prey.
Balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes with difficulty), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the broad roar of the lion, but rather a phrase in which the words are cries and growls.
The ocelots are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
According to scientists, ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by scent, sniffing their trail on the ground.
They see very well in the darkness thanks to their nocturnal vision, and they also move very stealthily. Ocelots track their prey by blending into their environment before pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population it comes from (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily go back), it often finds itself in a different environment than it was before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered as belonging to the same species.
We call this process "speciation", which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is to say, breathe out).
Plants produce their food using the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is from plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of the time, it feared nothing, except for other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with over 70 sharp teeth like razor blades, as well as an additional set of teeth in the palate, so that anything in its path couldn't escape.
We are not sure, but it is possible that he had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may have even been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex was no match for him.
Although the Romans consumed food that we are familiar with, they ate some strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and even dormouse, a type of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the women ate their food sitting on chairs, the wealthy men enjoyed organizing banquets together where they reclined on the side while having their meal.
The Roman meals of antiquity could not include these American or Asian foods that were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
The people would bring sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to fulfill the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard, and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could access.
Some pyramidal towers, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of a temple.
The summit of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The majority of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
The houses were built of stone.
As there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is told that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and found Greenland - and named it as such - while traveling further west.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian," there are numerous differences between the peoples, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you may think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" could be read. The text is located at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchment (which measures about 29 inches three quarters by 24 inches) was stored rolled up.
It is therefore likely that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landing and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
She was governed by the French from Vichy, French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of confronting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation "Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated the south of France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The term "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis," which means civil and is related to the Latin words "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," which means large city or city-state and also indicates, in a way, the size of the society to which it refers.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilization culture involves the transmission of knowledge over multiple generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government â€“ Congress being its only component â€“ under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, as there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
He also did not have the power to exempt from tax laws or customs duties between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands it comprises, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago".
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators passing through mentioned it under the name of Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous cereal production practices and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
The Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings surrounding the complex have been rebuilt to offer tourists a better insight into their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues until today.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most widespread film format at the end of the era of analog films.
It is still manufactured today, but what matters is that its image format is inherited from the format of digital camera sensors.
The 35mm format is actually, and quite disconcertingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
One says therefore that the aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family, for example) are equal to this aspect ratio or come very close to it.
The rule of thirds, often mistreated and ridiculed, is a simple guideline that encourages dynamism while also providing protection to the image.
He indicates that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was called into question.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power reached everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the financial funds of the church are specifically there for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over 1000 years, and this concentration of power and money led many people to wonder if this doctrine was being upheld.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain established a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy proved to be effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated the generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire maritime areas, thus posing a threat even to neutral ships.
As this tactic only elicited a timid response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a tendency towards pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wished to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take up a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred dollars to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During this time, fierce battles took place among many members of the nobility who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died in battles to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are numerous social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
After the revolution, the professions were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same goes for the military, as the ranking of armies is no longer based on class, but on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in issues that exceeded the scope of this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous as "Hira' " on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived over time, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not easy at all to find, even if we know it exists. When we entered the cave, we are completely isolated.
Above, one can only contemplate the clear and magnificent sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, one can see or hear very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many giant structures erected in honor of the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza necropolis," in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, includes several pyramids (the great pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many small pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor his wives as well as members of his family.
The symbol "push" looks like a V and the symbol "pull" like a staple or a square with the bottom side missing.
The top means that you must start from the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means that you must start from the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow held upwards generally produces a softer sound, while a bow held downwards is louder and more assertive.
Do not hesitate to mark your own fingerings with a pencil, but do not forget that printed bowings are for musical reasons and should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-ThÃ©rÃ¨se, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madame Ã‰lisabeth, all terrified, are forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of female sellers.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and yelling threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to have the windows of their carriages opened.
At one point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a slain royal guard at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses and interests of the obligations issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Naturally, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute the fundamental advantages of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
These events took place during the period generally considered the High Middle Ages â€“ a period in European history running from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300).
The Central Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense in which the fate of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself unfolds according to a process that goes far beyond cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies that is inherently conditioned rather than socially determined.
For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of healthcare to treat bodily injuries.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
According to Romanticism theories, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture linked to this geography would have appeared. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of the contemporary fashion world, Constantinople was considered as that of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100.
His status declined during the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
At that time, the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture, in the east.
However, due to the slowness of communication means, Western fashion could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for clothing fastenings.
Subsistence agriculture is practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, using saved seeds originating from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnic origin, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered "ferocious" or wild. Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of these children was due to the parents' rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability suffered by the child.
Wild children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature.
When raised entirely by non-human species, feral children display behaviors (within the limits of their physical capabilities) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a means to help learners who are discovering a new curriculum such as the use of a new program or the start of a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little paperclip man from Microsoft Office is one too.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to question, guide, and explain procedures that may have been too difficult for the student to handle alone.
The children are placed in foster families for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, as well as extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, nurturing, and educational, but that is the case.
We perceive the foster care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care placement system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The foster placement is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaching usage and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered to be major factors promoting the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, that is, facial expressions lasting for a few milliseconds.
It is claimed, in particular, that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," indicated how people who cannot understand the speech due to brain injuries are still able to accurately evaluate sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
The research of the twentieth century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination cause variations to alternate between the two populations with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its needs for amino acids from available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately, death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
By contrast, animal-origin food (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all vital amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as savanna chimpanzees do today.
The interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally waking up during your sleep period and then falling back asleep shortly after (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm, to make you regain consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock during your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorythm-based possibilities include drinking plenty of fluids before going to bed (especially water or tea, known to be diuretic), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The level of inner peace of a person is opposed to the level of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present vital force is. Each person has the possibility of finding absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that obstructs this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras activated, and the awakened consciousness created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods, and cultures ended the agreement between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
She would last for the next 40 years and would see real conflicts, through proxy armies, on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while interfering with the ability of your enemy to move its people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were attempting to transport soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using U-Boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany probably would have been able to conquer Great Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to have easy access to milk, fur, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended to by goatherds who were mostly children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known term of shepherds. These pastoral methods are still in place today.
The "wagonways" were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagon tracks were simply made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach greater speeds and pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
The crosspieces were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they were equipped with an iron band on top.
This has become a common practice, but the iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails made their appearance.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus ("upright man").
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual.
We find bipedal specializations in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even advocate for alleviating future suffering.
In many cases, this is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological advancements made by humans and that problems have become more significant due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant way of life.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, today known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap sheets whose existence is still known are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Few people consider them as dinosaurs since they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble a dinosaur.
They have legs covered in scales and equipped with claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rexes.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits to use computer jargon.
An internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indicator of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of medications or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects well adapted to parasitizing humans.
Bedbugs, like reduviid bugs, are nidicolous, i.e. adapted to living in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may very well feel that it is not in their best interest, nor in the child's, to take care of the education of a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In the context of an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
However, this is not the only one, experimentation, and an experience is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions and make observations, but which also guides scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, particularly on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's opinions on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to label either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus, or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in the germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can result in cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism interests people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, especially the wildlife and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information are examples of on-site activities.
One can, for example, go see, photograph, and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small rural towns by car to go to their place of work and cross paths with other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is in a way connected to a transport system based on private cars and supports it.
Science now shows that this carbon-based economy has disrupted the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
The traffic flow is the study of movements of drivers and individual vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable coherence and can be mathematically represented in an approximate manner.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
The insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape their enemies more easily and to more effectively find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a greater number of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Several thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km in width.
No less than 20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main branch of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of their size and technical excellence in construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholic.
Since antiquity, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper because they are found in nature in raw form and are fairly easy to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These elements were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was rather about the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also proposed the theory that these transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
We also find alloys that contain a small quantity of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new writing methods has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and rarer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to get close to a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next innovation arrives.
The fission bomb operates on the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
A bit like making a heavy cart climb a hill. By splitting the core again, then releasing some of that energy.
Certain atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break under little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is approximately 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
She is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents.
There may be more magma on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
The content theories focus on the search for what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives certain individuals to desire the things they do and what, in their environment, drives them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is to try to remain "the good buddy" (or the good friend).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything the group has created so far and do things their own way.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often causes discord between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
The members of a virtual team often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet based on different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the leadership team to which each member is accountable. It sets the standards for each of them.
Why would an organization want to impose upon itself the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the goals related to the implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are efficiently utilized in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can fully express themselves.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and its own learning culture.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They allow us to narrow down the scope of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
We have known for a long time that different types of brain damage, injuries, tumors, and traumas affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
The research in artificial intelligence aims to automate tasks that require an intelligent approach through machines.
Among the examples are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of writing, voice, and face.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines focused on providing solutions to everyday problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economy, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been implemented in several domestic computer software and video games.
Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus trip is not feasible.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can look at ancient objects in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful piece of art while sitting with their class.
Participating practically in an excursion is also an excellent way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future generations.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website dedicated to their visit to the state capital every year. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even though students often attempt blogging with neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually improves the situation.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author is starting to make an effort to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, the act of blogging "obliges students to better understand the world around them." The need to generate interest from the public encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When used properly, blogs can help students strengthen their analytical skills and critical thinking: by actively responding to online content, they can compare their views with others' and express their own opinions on specific subjects." (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and has a large number of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
You will find Niagara Falls to the south and the Muskoka region and its surroundings to the north, which have unspoiled natural beauty.
All these measures, and many others, make Ontario what foreigners consider the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in a wild state.
There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of East Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent all on its own, in terms of fauna.
Most small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the lands and this religion has widely spread to the Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, at the time when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape Route connecting Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended for every woman who travels to say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear a wedding ring (which should not look too precious).
Women must realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviors that they consider to be harassment. It is indeed common for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in refusing men's advances, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who had rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca after destroying it, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for shopping.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and all sorts of trinkets, but it is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city's streets, especially the downtown area.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be thoroughly researched to understand the ongoing state of conflict in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for tracking treks of mountain gorillas among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the key stops on Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World" show on PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the rest of the country's cities, as it has a style that is more Arab than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the southeast.
The total area of the park is 19,500 kmÂ², which is divided into 14 ecozones, each housing specific fauna.
It is one of the most well-known amusement parks in South Africa and considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It can be advantageous to obtain a Wild Card that provides access to certain parks in South Africa, as well as all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong lends its name to the territory of Hong Kong and serves as the main point of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that outlines the horizon of Hong Kong has been likened to a glittering bar chart, which is reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the waterfront of Kowloon located across.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the northern shore's landfill sites.
This is the place that the British colonists invested in. So, it seems to me to be a good starting point if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangroves in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not only composed of mangrove swamps: they also contain some of the last vestiges of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 kmÂ², of which roughly one third is covered by water/marshlands.
Sundarbans has been a natural reserve since 1966, where you can find around 400 royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
The buses depart from the inter-district bus terminal (located on the other side) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coasters, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Collective taxis are a fast and comfortable way to reach nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, at which time the Brazilian customs checkpoints should be completed.
The GuaranÃ­ were the most important indigenous group living in what is now the eastern part of Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes who inhabited the Chaco, such as the GuaycurÃº or the PayaguÃ¡, mainly survived thanks to fishing, hunting, and gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly nicknamed "the giant province of the Indies", was born from the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous populations.
The Spaniards inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of AsunciÃ³n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las CaÃ±itas.
Furthermore, smaller tournaments and matches are sometimes organized here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP) which is equivalent in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is commonly accepted currency everywhere in the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the neighboring islands, credit cards probably will not be accepted, although it is possible that British and American currencies will be. Discuss this in advance with the owners to agree on a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so change it before leaving the islands.
Montevideo being located south of the Equator, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures exceeding 30 Â°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There aren't really "rainy" and "dry" seasons: precipitation is fairly constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wild species; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to park authorities, it is necessary to stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and at 25 meters from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may seem, the bison, the moose, the elk, the bear, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a sadly famous naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful gathering in the city, as part of the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous because Auckland is situated between two ports. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and allow for safe swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbor, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very crowded with families, have numerous shops along the coast. Swimming there is safe.
The main local beer is the "Number One", a rather ordinary but tasty and refreshing beer. There is also another local beer, the "Manta".
There are plenty of French wines to taste, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can safely drink the local tap water, but you can easily find bottled water if you have concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "cafÃ© crÃ¨me" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", the cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate complies with Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, box jellyfish come near the beaches and river estuaries. They can sometimes also be seen outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would steer clear of them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat is found in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives the traveler peace of mind to know they will have a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation through travel agencies, such as camping areas.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, transportation services to/from the airport, or even packages combining flights and accommodation.
They can also hold the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other necessary documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any modification or request must be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
During certain music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to participate closely in the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-placed camping area.
Don't forget that even if the musical shows are over on the main stages, other musical performances may continue until late at night on other festival sites.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noise at the most exposed cabins.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos generally make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by customers. It is rare to find windows and clocks there, and the exits can be difficult to spot.
They generally offer special deals on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and keep them on site.
On certain sites, it is the locals who offer free alcoholic drinks. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to stay sober.
Anyone driving to high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time to block you.
Visibility can also be limited by snowfall or blowing snow, as well as by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is practically uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable moment for many visitors.
In everyday language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion on the African land, and particularly in the savanna, with the aim of witnessing the striking spectacle of wild animals in their environment.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles closely and standard equipment allows for a good observation of them.
The lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "walking safari" or "footing") consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may be faced with a delicate situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
By ironing wet clothes, they can be dried more easily. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if they are not in the rooms.
If you don't have a iron or if you don't feel like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you can find one.
Avoid not allowing the fabric to overheat (which can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, it is sufficient to boil the water for one minute; in others, it must be done for several minutes.
The efficiency of filters varies, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter nuisance animals that they are not familiar with in their original region.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation or, in the most serious cases, provoke allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.
In some localities, duty-free shops offer an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes make substantial savings, especially on products like alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated backcountry terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and tight curves are predominant.
The displayed speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and following sections - generally 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than before.
On the other hand, the mobile service is curiously much stronger here than in many other parts of the road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common there: apples are baked and cooked as pastries all year round, while cherries and plums appear in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small but hearty pastries, try the Berlin balls, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, served with meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be "solid" or "liquid" depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the northern interior regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualifier, it tends to refer to the food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now, widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a variety of simply seasoned dishes, with the predominant flavors that Javanese people favor being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on each side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a safety issue: in fact, the user's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear horseback riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, in particular English ones, have safety bars that allow a stirrup to fall off the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
CochamÃ³ Valley - The premier climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many large walls and different granite cliffs.
From the top of the peaks, the panoramas of the mountains are breathtaking. Climbers from around the world continue to discover new accessible paths on the slopes, where the possibilities are limitless.
Downhill winter sports, especially skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many aficionados, sometimes called "ski bums," who organize their entire vacations around skiing in specific locations.
The idea of skiing is very ancient: some cave paintings showing skiers date back to 5,000 years BC!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century; the first leisure ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski touring: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or ski touring.
This is similar to alpine touring skiing and mountaineering, without generally incorporating these activities, which are practiced on rugged terrain and require the use of much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly greater distances than on foot - but you will rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. In classic circumstances, traveling through several countries therefore involves having to make multiple visa applications and undergo multiple passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, works a bit like one country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the borders without going back through passport checkpoints.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to separately apply for a visa for each of the member countries of the area, which saves time, money, and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition for determining whether a manufactured object is an antique. Some tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The criteria vary depending on the location; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than that in Europe.
Handcrafted products can be considered antiques, even if they are less old than similar industrial products.
The reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people and the culture surrounding this industry is of great significance for many other professions.
Even though, according to tradition, not all Samis were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, they lived off fishing, hunting, and other similar activities, while primarily using reindeer as draft animals.
Nowadays, many SÃ¡mi people practice modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the SÃ¡mi region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the term "Gypsy" is often considered pejorative due to its association with negative stereotypes and a distorted image of the Roma people.
If the country you are traveling to is subject to a travel warning issued by your government, your international health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also seek advice from other governments than your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East could face different situations than those of Europeans or Arabs.
The reviews are just a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, and too simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Violent weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon capable of causing damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
The very unfavorable weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of several kinds, depending on the geographical, topographical, and atmospheric characteristics.
The strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and wildfires are forms and effects of violent weather, just like thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes.
Extreme, regional, and seasonal weather phenomena include cold storms, snowstorms with strong winds, and sand or dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to inquire about the risks of bad weather that may affect their destination area, as this may have an impact on the itineraries they are considering.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for "Courses in hostile environments" will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the questions addressed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A training usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapon handling training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few in number.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should make sure they have valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with the gender not indicated (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is equally variable.
The security checkpoint searches have also become much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender individuals should not expect to undergo scans while preserving their privacy and dignity.
The rip currents are the currents that come back from the waves breaking on the beach, often on a reef or equivalent.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a fast current towards deep waters can form there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from attempting to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you go off the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't get caught again. It is also possible that, depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted or not, you may want to wait for help.
The reintegration shock occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is less lengthy), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have struggled to adapt to the new culture sometimes have a lot of difficulty readapting to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and lost some habits of your original culture.
At first, when you travelled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the region for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and you can see them quietly before the start of the show.
Usually, one always hears the noise of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is positioned as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations, with sixteen of them being active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The island of King George, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples include the island of Livingston and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula melt into the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth mountain range, 360 km long and crossed by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, including the Vinson Massif, which peaks at 4892 m.
In remote areas without cell phone reception, you may have no choice but to rely on satellite phones.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a cell phone, as you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure boats, as well as by expeditions that have remote data transmission and telephony needs.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about connecting to this service.
Those who are planning a sabbatical year have the opportunity to learn while traveling, and more and more of them are choosing this option.
This formula is particularly appreciated by young people who are leaving school, as it allows them to take a gap year before university without compromising their studies.
Often, taking a gap year to study abroad can actually give you better chances of pursuing higher education in your own country.
As a rule, you have to pay registration fees to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and along the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand are in the same situation, but other than that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises are characterized by an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while coming back to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore with cruise excursions, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
The city of Berlin, in Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see by consulting the map above, Berlin is not located near the seaside at all and no visit to this city is included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There is no need to be ashamed of it: it's no different from the personal fears and anxieties that many people have towards other things.
For some, understanding how planes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear based on the unknown or feeling out of control.
Transport companies are well paid for performing fast deliveries. Very often, in the context of an urgent repair, the question of deadlines is crucial for the documents, goods, or spare parts related to it.
On certain routes, big companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for small companies, there has been an issue.
If they had sent goods by air freight, on certain routes, it would have taken days to clear the unloading and customs.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. Air regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most obvious way to travel in first class or business class is to shell out a large sum of money for this privilege (or, better yet, to ask your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
In general, it is pointless to try to get discounts for business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can count on a certain type of travelers who are willing to pay a high price for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their fares accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is ChiÈ™inÄƒu. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is very widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but recognized by no UN member countries.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million inhabitants, Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second port after Istanbul, and an excellent hub for connections.
What was the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed and lively commercial center, located around a huge bay, surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers are scattered with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more reminiscent of the Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of HaldarsvÃ­k offers views of the neighboring island of Eysturoy and is home to an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, we find interesting marble sculptures representing doves on certain tombs.
It is worth taking a half-hour stroll in this fascinating village.
The romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, located in the north, is easily accessible and has been made famous among foreigners by the glowing account of its splendor given by Lord Byron.
The 403 bus from Scotturb regularly goes to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
When heading north, be sure to visit the beautiful sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (temple), a place known worldwide for the apparitions of Mary.
Don't forget that you are essentially visiting a charnel house, as well as a site that holds almost immeasurable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many women and men alive who have survived their stay here, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labor, Jews or non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone is capable of speaking Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as the law establishes that it is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only made in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are announced by an automated system in numerous languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave well, to act like someone well-mannered. This will greatly facilitate your movements.
The Parisians' abrupt exteriors quickly evaporate if you show a minimum of courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely wooded, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a wide variety of plant communities due to the diversity of its microclimates, soils, and altitude levels.
The region also hosts a wide variety of animal species and birds.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be seen there, as well as many other common species.
When visiting a monastery, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and have their shoulders also covered.
Most monasteries provide stoles to women who arrive with nothing, but if you bring your own, and it is brightly colored, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Just as men must wear pants covering the knees.
This garment can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but since it is not washed after each use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and makes use of olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and all available condiments, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, followed by the word "Sie" which means you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an excellent way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
We can also say that it facilitates reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know if a verb or an adjective is used in nominalized form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch are the c and the g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Please also make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" in a distinct way: "caro" means "dear", while "carro" means "cart".
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
As a result, reading this introduction to grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it is not necessary to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution at their time was not as concerning as it is today, they are generally located in cities or on campuses, which are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous infrastructures placed in remote regions where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the close aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants display their most beautiful appearance when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" of them.
If you visit a strictly landscaped garden, the collection of "specimens" will also get you expelled without discussion.
Singapore is generally considered an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to get around, and where you can buy almost everything you need once you arrive.
But, located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will need to adapt to the heat (always) and to strong sunlight (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you are considering taking goes to Hebron and not just to the neighboring Jewish settlement of Kyriat Arba.
Inland waterways can be an excellent theme for a vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to interesting sites on the Danube or boating along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes for hiking trails and popular bike paths.
Christmas is one of the most important celebrations in Christianity, it celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions related to these holidays have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians worldwide.
It is traditional to spend the Easter night awake in an open place to see the sunrise.
There are obviously Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during Easter weekend, with congregations often bursting into the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that arrived on these islands originally did so by water, either swimming or aboard floating objects, or by air.
Due to the great distance that separates them from the mainland, the mammals were unable to complete the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, numerous mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to admire the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark practically all day.
As the regions are sparsely populated, and light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
The costumes are classic work attire, and employees are called by their last name or by their job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, as it emphasizes collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often need to obtain their superior's approval for any decision they make and are expected to obey their superior's instructions without questioning.
