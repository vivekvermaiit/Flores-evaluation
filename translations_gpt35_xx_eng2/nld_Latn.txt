The American Olympic Committee has the support of USA Gymnastics and understands the necessity for the Olympic family to promote a safe space for all athletes.
We support the USOC's statement that it is best for our athletes and clubs, and their sport, to implement meaningful changes in our organization instead of revoking certifications.

This not only proves the widely spread theory that at least certain dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides more details than fossils, such as the color and three-dimensional placement.
According to scientists, the feather coat of this animal was chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development, because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or rachis, but do have other feather characteristics - such as barbs.
The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that they were not used for flying, but for regulating temperature or for aesthetic purposes. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this specimen actually shows adult feathers and not the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, despite it being the tail of a young dinosaur, the monster had the feathers of an adult and not the down of a chick.

The annoyances within the community resulted in the current attempts to establish a policy regarding the sexual content of the site that hosts millions of pieces of media content with an open license.
The completed work was mainly theoretical in nature, but the program was written for simulating observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The team was looking for the effect that would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the universe and that of the Milky Way.
Similar to how the moon exerts force on the earth, leading to tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The researchers concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as regular matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in a galaxy is located around, in a kind of ring, and consists of a large quantity of smaller particles.

What is consistent is that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and of the Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, traditionally, voting does not require much technology: voters go into a booth and put a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope indicating which candidate they are voting for.
Officials first check the identity of the voter. Then the voter slides the envelope into the ballot box and then signs the ballot paper.
The process is relatively tightly defined in the electoral law of France.
Ballot boxes have to be transparent since 1988, so that both the voters and the observers can see that at the beginning of the voting there are no envelopes inside and that no other envelopes are added than those of registered and authorized voters.
The candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. Volunteers count the votes in the evening under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

In the other race she participated in, the sitting Giant Slalom, she finished tenth among the women, with a combined time of 4:41:30. That is 2:11:60 minutes slower than the Austrian winner Claudia Loesch, and 1:09:02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth.
Four female skiers in the sitting slalom group were unable to complete their runs and 45 out of 117 skiers failed to qualify in the giant slalom during the race.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone have been recovered by the Madhya Pradesh police.
According to Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya, five of the rapists of the Swedish woman have been arrested and they have found her mobile phone and laptop.
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar are the suspects.
According to police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects had their faces covered when they appeared in court.
There were three people in the house when the car hit it, but none of them were injured.
The driver did, however, sustain serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services tried to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially he was admitted in Great Yarmouth, at the James Paget Hospital.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been convicted in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for murdering her son.
She is in custody pending the charges and the trial, but the eyewitness account may be tainted because her story has been widely publicized.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland operates differently and courts have deemed the publication of photos as potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that 'journalists are playing a dangerous game when they publish photos and other things of suspects.'
Crown Office has overall responsibility for prosecutions and has informed journalists that no further statements will be made, at least until charges have been filed.
According to sources, the document refers to a dispute settlement, something the Palestinians wanted based on the pre-war borders in the Middle East in 1967.
Other topics that were discussed are the future status of Jerusalem, a city that is sacred to both peoples, and the issues in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that after the signing of an agreement, there is a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years. However, the PA is only willing to have a presence for five years.
Shooters in the additional pest control trial had to be closely monitored by forest rangers. The trial was closely followed and its effectiveness was assessed.
During a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director for park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four chosen shooters for the first culling operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new nine-member provisional electoral council (Provisional Electoral Council or CEP).
With this, Martelly has achieved a CEP five times in the past four years.
Last month, the presidential committee recommended the dismissal of the previous National Electoral Council. This is part of a package of measures to ensure new elections in the country.
The committee was created by Martelly in response to the widespread protests against the government that have been taking place since October.
The sometimes violent protests arose from the lack of elections, some of which should have taken place since 2011.
There are around 60 reported cases of defective iPods overheating. In total, this resulted in six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of the 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called 'not serious'.
"Very regrettable," was the reaction of the ministry to the fact that Apple has postponed the report.
Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 07.19 local time (Friday 21.19 GMT).
The Bureau for Disaster Management of the Northern Mariana Islands declared that no damage has been reported nationwide.
Furthermore, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manila, the Philippine capital, a former policeman from the Philippines has hijacked tourists from Hong Kong by hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists.
Several hostages have been brought to safety and so far at least six fatalities have been confirmed.
Six hostages were released earlier, including the children and elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
Later the photographers returned in exchange for an elderly woman who needed to use the toilet. Ultimately, Mendoza was shot.
Liggins started working in the field of medicine, following in his father's footsteps.
Trained as a midwife, he started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working at the hospital, Liggins conducted research on premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that the maturation of fetal lungs in babies was accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government researchers recovered two 'black boxes' with flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. Just as unique as she was. A strong woman."
Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels indicated that 'Luna was just as weird as I am... maybe even weirder... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place'.
From the 1400 people surveyed for the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the 2010 federal elections that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the participants in this poll supported this stance. They want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
29 percent of the respondents felt that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and at the other end, 31 percent said it should never happen.
The Olympic winner of the gold medal swam the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and three relay races during the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was called into question due to his complaints.
He wasn't able to take the medications he needed to relieve his pain because they are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the currently largest known prime number on January 25th.
Different people verified the discovery in early February using different hardware and software and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source through which water came to earth, along with organic material forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to gain insight into the way planets are formed. They particularly want to know how the earth originated, given that it has been a very long time since comets collided with the earth.
Cuomo (53) was inaugurated as governor earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing marriages between people of the same sex.
He called the rumors 'political nonsense and gossip'.
There is speculation that he wants to run for the presidency in 2016.
With the NextGen system, airplanes could take shorter routes according to the FAA, potentially saving millions of tons of fuel annually for lower carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground radar technologies, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much more effectively, and provide pilots with clearer information.
No extra transport will be provided and no overground trains will stop at Wembley, in addition, the parking lots and the P&R are not accessible on the premises.
A possible lack of transportation caused the likelihood to increase that the game would be played behind closed doors and without supporters.
A study published in the scientific journal Science on Tuesday was about the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations. It was believed that this process took much longer because the crossing of a native Darwin's finch, the Medium ground finch, with an immigrant Cactus ground finch, the Española ground finch, took longer.
Gold can be processed into many shapes. It can be rolled up into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a narrow thread that can be twisted and braided. It can also be forged or rolled into plates.
After it has been made very thin, it can be stuck onto another metal. It can even be made so thin that it was sometimes used for the decoration of hand-painted illustrations in books called 'illuminated manuscripts'.
This is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Then the color of the cabbage juice changes based on the acidity (acidic to basic or alkaline) of the chemical substance.
The pH value is indicated based on the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical substance that has been tested.
Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders together, moisten and clean your hands, and form it into a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a sort of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a flush toilet that was connected to an advanced sewer system.
Sewage remains have been found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Furthermore, there were already toilets in China, Egypt, and Persia in antiquity. In the era of the Romans, toilets were often part of a public bathhouse, where both ladies and gentlemen would come together in a mixed group.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it is immediately sent back.
The satellite has been launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts a part of our light and image.
To deliver a satellite or telescope into space, you need to have a huge rocket that is more than 30 meters long.
The wheel has incredibly changed the world. The most important thing that the wheel has given us is easier and faster transportation.
The train, the car and many other means of transportation are the result of this.
There are medium-sized felines among those who eat medium-sized prey, from hares to antelopes and deer.
Moreover, there are many small cats (such as free-roaming cats kept as pets) that hunt larger numbers of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success comes from the idea of a niche, a specific job that every cat has which prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
Troops consist of one to three adult males who are family and also have up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A troop of lions behaves in almost the same way as a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) and are very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (though not well), swim, leap great distances, and has five times the pulling power of a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four big cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger does not roar at full force like a lion. It's more like he growls a whole sentence.
The favorite meal of ocelots is small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. The ocelot almost exclusively hunts animals that are much smaller than itself.
Scholars suspect that ocelots use their sense of smell to hunt for small animals (their prey) by sniffing the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark through night vision and move very inconspicuously. Ocelots hunt for prey by blending in with the environment and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes detached from the large population they originated from (for example, by moving over a mountain range or river, or when they are transferred to another island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, different resources and different enemies occur, so the new population must behave differently or adapt in order to be able to compete.
Because they still need the same adjustments as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also started to resemble the other population less and less.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called speciation and simply involves the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in and they take in carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants derive their nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
Our houses and clothing are made from plants. We mainly eat plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain at that time. He had nothing to fear from anyone, except from other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the palate, meaning that nothing or no one could escape from him.
It is not certain, but possibly its tongue was forked. It ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps even its own kind.
In water features, nothing was safe from the attacks; even gigantic dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were no match for him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
In addition, there was another difference; poor people and women sat on chairs during meal times, but rich men preferred to have a banquet together where they lounged on their sides while eating.
Meals from ancient Roman times did not contain any food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They for example did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa. Furthermore, no old Roman has ever eaten a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for all their gods. This temple was seen as the god's own house.
Offerings were brought to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by organizing ceremonies and feasts.
Every temple had a public courtyard and a back room that was only accessible to priests.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, towers in the form of pyramids were built, called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family mostly took place outside.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were nothing more than a counter along the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, and therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland had few inhabitants. According to Norwegian sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on his way to the west, and gave it its name.
He made this discovery, but at that time there were already Eskimo tribes living there.
Although they were all 'Scandinavian' countries, the people, the royal families, customs and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Norway were very different from each other.
Maybe you think after watching the movie National Treasure that there is a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That is based on a misunderstanding. There is something written on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the American Declaration of Independence are the words 'Original American Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776'. The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) used to be rolled up for storage.
It seems that the indication has simply been added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the battles that followed, the north of France was liberated. However, the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by Vichy France. These were French people who sided with the Germans in 1940 and thus collaborated with the enemy instead of fighting against them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France with Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated Southern France in just two weeks. After that, they headed towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture that is shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
From the Latin civilis, which means civil, comes the term civilization, related to the Latin civis, which then stands for citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state; and that also defines in a certain way the format of the society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed down through multiple generations, leaving a lasting cultural footprint and balanced distribution.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence behind. Consequently, they are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the revolution, thirteen states formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, consisting only of a congress.
The congress lacked the power to levy taxes because there was no national executive or judicial authority, and the implementation of all decisions relied on state authorities that often did not want to cooperate.
It also did not have the authority to disregard tax laws and rates between states.
First, all states had to unanimously agree on the articles before they could be amended, but the states did not take the national government so seriously, causing their representatives to be often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German team, is globally the second most successful team and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports are soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are especially popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (with Honshu being the largest island). This makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is frequently referred to as a "peninsula" from a geographical perspective.
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when sailors from Europe sailed past the island and gave it the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established itself in the southwest of Taiwan as a base, where it addressed the indigenous grain production processes and put Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, the western and northern coast areas of Taiwan were conquered by troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was incorporated as a province of the Qing Empire in the year 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, transferring sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Built from three major constructions, the Machu Picchu consists of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber with Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists can get a better idea of what they used to look like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored. The renovation is still ongoing.
For example, worldwide the most common photo format for still images is 35 mm, which was the usual film format in the end of the analog film era.
These are still being produced to this day, although it is mainly the ratio of the image that the digital camera's image sensor took over.
Strangely enough, 35mm film is actually 36mm wide, with a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this size (dividing by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) would be 3:2 in that case.
Many common aspect ratios (such as APS-like ratios) are equal to or a close approximation of this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often abused and ridiculed by many, is a simple guideline that makes the image dynamic, yet also organized.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines. This way you divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
In this period in the history of Europe, the rich and powerful Catholic Church came under fire.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has connected European states, despite differences in language and customs.
From the king to the common citizen, his all-encompassing power had an influence on everyone.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to combat suffering and poverty, and for this reason the church has financial resources.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this relationship of power and money led many people to begin doubting whether this principle was being upheld.
Great Britain imposed a sea blockade against Germany right after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved to be effective, because it was no longer possible to provide vital supplies to military personnel and civilians. However, this blockade did violate the generally accepted international law that has been established in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain has placed mines in international waters, so that in many parts of the ocean, ships could no longer navigate, which was even dangerous for neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country's unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 20s, most citizens and nations had an attitude of pacifism and isolation.
After the First World War, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
Tesla emigrated to the United States of America in 1884 to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he only had 4 cents, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous boss) for Thomas Edison with him.
The ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each ruling family had a distinctive dynasty.
Also between the different dynasties there was an unstable period in which the provinces were divided. The most well-known was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which took place in the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
There were fierce wars taking place at that time between different nobles who were fighting for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the era of the Three Kingdoms is recorded as one of the bloodiest. Thousands of people died in the battle for the top position in the great palace in Xi'an.
The Revolution had significant social and political consequences, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to its citizens rather than a single leader.
After the revolution, positions were available for all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
The same goes for the army. Military ranks are no longer based on someone's class but on the caliber of the person.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in other countries to revolution.
Mohammed was intensely involved in otherworldly matters. He often went for contemplation to a cave that later became known as the Cave of Hira in the Mountain of Noor.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of the spirituality of Mohammed.
The cave is located on one of the mountain tops on the north side of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Even if it was known that the cave existed, it was not easy to find at all. Once inside the cave, total isolation prevails.
The only thing to see are the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. There is very little to see or hear of this world from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world still standing.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of the countless large pyramid structures erected in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or 'pyramids of Giza' in the Egyptian valley of the kings contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), multiple small tombs, a number of temples, and the great sphinx.
The large pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu. Many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built as a tribute to Khufu's wives and family members.
The up-bow sign looks like a V and the down-bow sign looks like a staple or a square with the bottom missing.
Above means that you must start at the tip and push the bow away. Below means that you must start at the frog (the spot where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow towards you.
An upward movement usually produces a softer sound, while a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Feel free to sketch your personal signs, but don't forget that the printed bowings are there for a musical reason, so they usually need to be respected.
A group of market women were behind the departure of the terrified Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese of 11 and Louis-Charles of 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They rode back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by cheering and threatening mobs that threatened the royal couple.
Because of the actions of the crowd, the king and queen were forced to fully open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, someone in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard who had been murdered in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war costs of the U.S. imperialism in relation to the conquest of the Philippines have been paid by the population of the Philippines.
They were imposed to pay taxes to the American colonial regime in order to finance a large part of the expenses, and the interest on bonds was issued through banks on Wall Street in the name of the Filipino government.
The American imperialism relied heavily on the immense profit from the prolonged exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that prompted the formation of the order.
The era in which this occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
After the early Middle Ages came the high Middle Ages. These were followed by the late Middle Ages, which usually end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide range of ideas in practice: from technology supply or technological imperative to a strict sense that human fate is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general notions: the development of technology follows a trajectory that largely extends beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has 'effects' on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
Some, for example, will say that the arrival of the car automatically leads to the construction of roads.
A national road network is economically not feasible for just a few cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to lower the costs of car ownership.
The high car ownership also leads to a higher number of accidents on the road, which in turn leads to the development of new techniques in the field of healthcare to be able to repair the human body.
In romanticism, a large part of cultural determinism was integrated, which originated from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In Romanticism, geography shaped the individual and over time, customs and cultures arose as a result of this geography. These formed a harmonious society and were better than arbitrary imposed laws.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, much like Paris is the current fashion capital.
From about 400 AD to about 1100 AD, it was known as an epicenter of luxury.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders returned with silk and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
The gothic style reached its peak in the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
Clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture from the East in the beginning.
Due to the slow communication channels, styles in the west, however, were 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, a distinct style began to develop in Western Europe. One of the biggest developments was the result of the Crusades: people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture in which enough food is produced to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Agriculture with the aim of livelihood is a simple system that is usually organic. Here, stored seeds from the ecoregion are used and combined with rotating crops or other relatively simple techniques to optimize yield.
In the past, most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture. This is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms, giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can distinguish themselves based on the age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or gender of their members.
A subculture can be determined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or one or more of these factors together.
Members of a subculture often show which group they belong to through a specific symbolic style in what they wear, how they behave, and the jargon they speak.
One of the most commonly used methods for illustrating the importance of social integration were the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, setbacks, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
They are called 'wolf children' or 'wild children'. Some wolf children have been locked up by humans (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned because the parents did not want to accept the serious intellectual or physical limitation of the child.
Unruly children may have experienced severe child abuse or a serious trauma before being abandoned or before running away.
Some are claimed to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived only in the wilderness.
A feral child that has not been raised by humans may exhibit behavior that resembles the behavior of the animal that has cared for the child (within physical limits), such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
Learning on a project basis should simplify education and make it more interesting, but scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who are dealing with a new learning experience, for example a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. A teacher, for example, is a form of support, but the paperclip man from Microsoft Office is as well.
There is virtual scaffolding built into the software that asks questions, provides memory aids, and explains procedures that may be difficult for students to understand without help.
There are several reasons why children end up in foster care, such as neglect, abuse, and exploitation.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where they are not well taken care of, where they are not cared for, and where they cannot develop, yet this happens.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe zone for these children.
The intention is that foster care provides a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
In foster care, all needs that were neglected in the previous home must be met.
On the internet, parts of interpersonal and mass communication are combined.
The different characters of the internet lead to new dimensions in the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
'Leren' and 'socialization' are, for example, presented as important reasons to use the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivation aspects such as 'personal involvement' and 'sustained relationships' when they examined public responses to websites.
That video recordings are being used, led to remarkable findings in interpreting micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
It is primarily stated that no one can recognize a lie by only focusing on micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks described in his essay The President's Speech how people who can't understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess its sincerity.
He even suggested that other animal species, like domestic dogs, also have the ability to interpret human behavior.
From research in the twentieth century, it has been found that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
Through mutation, new genetic variation is added; through selection, this variation is eliminated from the pool of expressed variation.
For every generation, variation occurs between the two groups through separation and recombination.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans will have a hard time obtaining the necessary amino acids from the plant sources available on the savannah.
Furthermore, failure to take it seriously can have serious consequences: growth retardation, malnutrition, and ultimately even death.
The easiest to find plant-based sources are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, they are difficult to digest for primates like us.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it also contains a very high amount of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in the same way chimpanzees on the savanna solve this problem today.
Sleep interruption means that you wake up with a reason during your normal sleep period and that you fall back to sleep within a short time (10-60 minutes).
This is quite easy by using a relatively gentle alarm clock that brings you back to consciousness without fully waking you up right away.
If you turn off your alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room. That way, you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm are, for example, drinking a lot of fluids before going to sleep (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic). This will cause you to have to get up to pee.
The amount of inner calm a person possesses is in contrast to the amount of stress a person carries in their body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the present life force. Every person is capable of achieving satisfaction and total peace.
Everyone can enlighten their own mind. Only your own stress and negativity stand in the way of this goal.
The Tibetan Buddhism has its foundation in the teachings of Buddha. However, this form of Buddhism has been expanded with the Mahayana path of love and with a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
The Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation, and a pursuit of universal love.
By practicing yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga (enlightenment energy) is awakened.
The essence of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as the focus. By visualizing different deities, energy channels are cleaned, chakras activated, and consciousness brought to an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, a collaboration between the USSR and the US was established. When the war ended, conflicts between system, process, and culture caused the countries to quarrel with each other.
The former allies were facing each other two years after the end of the war, this was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last 40 years and battles with proxy armies took place on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
The Polish defense forces only held out until September 17, 1939, after which they had to retreat and reorganize along the bridgehead in Romania.
These plans, however, were outdated in one night when 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern parts of Poland. This was in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international peace treaties that were both bilateral and multilateral.
Goods transport by ship is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, it is the task of the navy to ensure that a country maintains the ability to transport people and goods, while at the same time impeding the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
The US tried to get troops and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to the British, and with this North Atlantic campaign of WWII, this is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
The German navy tried to simultaneously block this traffic primarily using U-boats.
Just like the rest of Europe, Great Britain would probably have fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
It seems that the goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Iranian Zagros Mountains.
In ancient times, cultures and tribes began to keep them so that they could always easily access their hair, meat, milk, and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other grazing area. They were then guarded by goatherds, often a child or teenager like the more well-known shepherd. Today, herding is still done in the same way.
In the 16th century, horse-drawn railways were already being built in England.
Although horse-drawn railways consisted only of a track of planks, the horses still had to run faster and pull larger quantities than on the somewhat difficult roads of that time.
Crossbeams were already used fairly early to keep the rails in place. However, gradually it was realized that rails would be more efficient if there was an iron point present on the top.
This quickly became the common practice, but the iron resulted in more wear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants. The first fully iron rails were laid in 1767.
The first form of transport that we know is walking. People began walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus emerged (which means upright man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, walked less frequently upright.
In fossils of the Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, bipedal specializations are found. By the way, the Sahelanthropus may have already been walking on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, join an environmental movement, or even take action to somewhat alleviate future suffering.
It is often just like a symptomatic treatment. But if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to identify the cause of the problems and eliminate it.
The scientific and technological developments of human society have clearly and significantly changed the earth. Furthermore, overpopulation and the extravagant human lifestyle have exacerbated the problems.
After the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to the printer John Dunlap's shop a few streets away. This draft was signed by President of the Continental Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made. These are now better known as 'Dunlap broadsides'.
John Nixon gave the public reading of the document for the first time on July 8th in the garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9. Another copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists believe that a species of dinosaur still exists today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many things about birds that make people think of a dinosaur.
On their legs they have claws and scales, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulating data encoded in binary digits forms the basis for nearly all computers used today.
A binary number can only have two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (or in computer language 'bits').
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be immediately made.
The presence of open boxes of medicines or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
This insect group is formally called 'bugs' by entomologists.
This term stems from an ancient agreement with bed bugs, which are insects that are very adept at parasitizing humans.
Both red soldier bugs and bed bugs are nestbound, they have adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the US, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the primary neurological condition in adults of both younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system. This includes the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
From research it has been shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their best interest, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to give up their baby for adoption.
In an adoption, the parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Discovering how the world works using the scientific method is the main goal of science. This method is the guideline for most scientific research.
However, it is about more than just experiments; an experiment is a test to exclude one or more potential assumptions, to raise question marks and to make observations, as a guide for scientific research.
Nature experts and philosophers focused on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
The views of Aristotle on science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less as knowledge of Greek declined.
In physiological and behavioral observations of rhythms, there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production via the biological clock.
Most creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, live according to periodic rhythms. These are not just responses to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that go through a cycle for a certain period of time, even if no external signals are given.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the most important indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were carried out. In one experiment, the DNA in the phage was marked with a radioactive phosphorus, and in the other experiment, the protein of the phage was marked with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells are hereditary. Other mutations can cause cells to die or can lead to cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who like to visit natural areas because they want to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
On the spot one can, among other things, hunt, fish, take photographs, observe birds, go to parks, and study the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people from small villages drive to their workplace and pass by people whose workplace is located in the village they just came from.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is in some way in contact with and supports a transport system based on private cars.
The science shows that due to this massive carbon economy, the biosphere is no longer in a stable state, which allowed human evolution to take place over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about it.
In developed countries, problems with water quality or collapsing bridges rarely occur in comparison.
Why do so many complaints arise with transport systems, why does it go wrong on a daily basis? Are transport technicians simply incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
With a traffic flow, the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the individuals are considered.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to investigate the traffic flow, because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave reasonably predictably. This means that traffic flows show some level of consistency and that there is something to say about this from a mathematical perspective.
Connections have been made between the three core characteristics to better represent traffic flow: (1) intensity, (2) density, and (3) speed.
With the help of these relationships, planning, designing, and operating civil engineering facilities are facilitated.
Insects were the first animals to start flying. Thanks to their ability to fly, they could escape from enemies more easily and find food and mating partners more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to hide in a larger number of small places from predators.
Currently, only dragonflies and mayflies cannot fold their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were people who thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, and so did the Sun (and other stars).
This sounds reasonably logical, because you don't feel the earth moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and second longest river and carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth and has a width of six miles in some places.
Sure 20% of all the water that flows into the sea through the rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The water originates from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unrivaled in terms of size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was already over a thousand years old.
There are about 800 inhabitants living in Vatican City. This is the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the official language for the official communication and laws of Vatican City.
Italian is the language that is most spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is widely used during religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times because they are all found in nature and it is relatively easy to mine them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This seemed more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they transition into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply put a combination of at least metals. As you probably know, the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium fall under the metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys can also contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms would fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a loyal friend to many people when it was launched.
The pen has unfortunately decreased in status as newer writing methods have emerged and is much less frequently used.
Nowadays, people write messages on a computer screen without ever needing a pencil sharpener.
You may wonder what will happen to the keyboard once something new comes on the market.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a core with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When the core is split again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable core, which means that they fall apart at the slightest touch or stress.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock. The crust is the outer layer of the moon.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner beneath the maria and thicker beneath the highlands.
There may be more cracks on the side, because the crust is thinner there. Lava could more easily come to the surface there.
Content theories are aimed at determining what motivates people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they grow older.
With these theories, they want to investigate the reasons why certain people want certain things and which environmental factors influence them to do certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's Motivation-Hygiene theory.
Generally, two approaches come to the fore when managers start leading their former colleagues. In one approach, they try to position themselves as equals.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and disciplinary measures, conduct performance evaluations, delegate, and hold people accountable for their responsibilities.
On the other end of the spectrum, this person transforms into an unrecognizable individual. He or she feels the need to change everything that the team has done so far, and wants to make everything his or her own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to a gap between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as normal teams, although there are small differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They are often more independent than traditional team members. This is because their teams can have meetings in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to start the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One of the goals for implementing organizational learning concepts in practice is innovation.
Creativity and resourcefulness come to light when all available resources are effectively used within the functional departments of an organization.
The result of this is that the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
To enable innovation in an organization, management must cultivate a culture in which innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning are central.
According to Angel (2006), organizations can perform better with an approach based on the continuum model.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. This can narrow down the research field and allow for more accurate data collection.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, wounds, and tumors can affect behavior and lead to changes in mental ability.
Because there are increasingly more new technologies, we are learning more and more about the structures and processes in the brain.
This offers us a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that will give us more insights into the processes of our mind.
AI immediately makes most people think of science fiction, but it is also an essential part of computer science. It is used in research on machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
The development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior falls under research into AI.
Some examples are management, planning, the ability to respond to customer inquiries and diagnoses, and recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to real-life problems.
Nowadays, this artificial intelligence system is widely used in economic, medical, technical, and military fields, such as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
For every class, many excursions are planned. Often a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Thanks to technological developments, virtual excursions are now possible. This allows students to view artifacts in a museum, peek into an aquarium, or see beautiful artworks from the classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a fantastic way to look back on a trip and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, which is redesigned each year and previous versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students to write better. Often their grammar and spelling are still poor at the beginning, but this quickly changes because they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve the writing and avoid criticism.
By blogging, students are also forced to find out more about the world around them. The need to keep the audience interested inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
When used properly, blogs can help students develop their analytical skills and critical thinking; by actively engaging in online discussions, students can find their own place in the context of others' material and at the same time determine their own position on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
The bilingual capital of Canada is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and future.
Further to the south you will find the Niagara Falls. In the north you will find the beautiful untouched Muskoka and even more.
This kind of thing makes Ontario in the eyes of outsiders typically Canadian.
Further north, large areas are quite sparsely populated and some of these areas are even virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than the total population of Canada.
The East African islands are situated along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and in terms of fauna, it is almost a separate continent.
The majority of the smaller islands consist of independent countries or are connected to France, and they are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought the Islamic faith with them, after which it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India, which marked the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region borders to the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean and to the north with the Sahel region.
Women: female travelers are advised to say that they are married, whether true or not.
It also helps to wear rings (not too expensive looking rings).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to behavior that they find intimidating and that it is common to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be clear when rejecting a man and do not be afraid to stand your ground. (Cultural differences do not excuse this!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. The city was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids and was known by the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the harbor and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. After an earthquake in 1755, they left the city again.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Bayad. The Spanish traders who established their trading base here named it Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina you will find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, pots, leather products, water pipes and other trinkets, but it is purely aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The city is located near Rwanda, in the far east.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed when the Nyiragongo volcano erupted and most of the city's streets, especially the city center, were buried.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, for visits outside Goma, you should check the situation regarding the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
In addition, the city serves as the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and you can find some of the most affordable trips for Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
With boda-boda (a motor taxi) you can get around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
'Timbuktu' is relatively inaccessible and is therefore nowadays used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today Timbuktu is a dilapidated city, although the city's reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites due to desert storms.
It was one of the key stopping points of the PBS exhibition Special Wonders from the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city differs from the other cities in the country, because it has more of an Arabic look than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, along the border with Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park is 19,500 square kilometers large, divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various wild animal species are kept.
This park is the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks) as a major attraction in South Africa.
As with all South African national parks, daily conservation fees and entrance fees apply.
It can also be useful to buy a Wild Card. These offer either access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The entire territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong and is considered the main spot by many tourists.
The large number of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering bar chart that is visible thanks to the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the waterfront of Kowloon across the water.
The vast majority of the population of the island of Hong Kong lives very close together on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists have settled, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial history of the area, then you can start here.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world and stretch 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the Indian and Bangladeshi inland.
The Sundarbans have now been officially included on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The portion within the Indian borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are more than just mangrove swamps — they also feature some of the last mighty pieces of jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², one third of which is peat and marshland.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife reserve since 1966 and the area is now home to an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 axis deer.
During the day, buses depart from the station at the border of the districts (across the river). Most depart between 6:30 and 7:30, especially in the direction of the east and Jakar/Bumthang.
It is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance, as the local buses are often fully booked.
In most neighborhoods, small Japanese Coaster buses are driving that are comfortable and robust.
With shared taxis, one can travel quickly and comfortably to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque with the French Guianese city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters. The building has a length of 378 meters and has two passageways with a width of 3.50 meters.
Under the bridge, the clearance height is 15 meters. The construction of the bridge was completed in August 2011, but it only opened to traffic in March 2017.
According to the schedule, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017. It is expected that the Brazilian customs posts will be ready for use by then.
The Guaraní were the most prominent indigenous group. They lived in the area that is now East Paraguay, lived as semi-nomadic hunters, and also practiced self-sufficient agriculture.
In the province of Chaco, other indigenous tribes lived, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who found their food by hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Paraguay, formerly also known as 'the great province of the Indies', emerged in the 16th century when Spanish colonists encountered the indigenous population.
There followed a three-century long period of colonization under the Spanish.
Asunción was founded in 1537 and since then Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the largest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Here are smaller tournaments and matches to see at other times of the year.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information about tournaments and purchasing tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP). The value is approximately equal to one British pound (GBP).
On the islands, there is only one bank, namely in Stanley opposite the FIC West store. Here you can exchange money.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley you can often pay with credit cards and US dollars.
On the remote islands, you probably can't pay with a credit card, but probably with British and American currency. Ask the owners in advance how you can pay.
Exchange your money back before you leave the islands, as Falkland currency is very difficult to exchange outside of them.
Montevideo is located below the equator, so when it's summer there, it's winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures higher than +30°C are common.
The winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature almost never drops below zero, but the wind combined with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The rainfall level remains approximately the same throughout the year, without recognizable 'wet' and 'dry' periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are ultimately just wild. Therefore, they should not be fed or disturbed.
Keep at least 100 meters distance from bears and wolves in the park, and 25 meters from all other wild animals.
Elks, bison, reindeer, bears and nearly all other large animals can attack you, no matter how docile they may seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Furthermore, you should be aware that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid wearing or cooking fragrant foods and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia and the city, with nearly 40,000 inhabitants, is located on the island of Upolu.
Around the year 1850, Apia was founded and it has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the US, and Great Britain did not want to leave the port. This later became known as the infamous standoff.
With the exception of a British battleship, all ships were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle by the Mau movement, the highest leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, was killed during a peaceful gathering in the city that escalated into violence.
There are many beaches, mainly because of the two harbours of Auckland. The most popular are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore in the North Harbour district stretch from north to south along the Pacific Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most of them have pohutukawa trees that provide shade.
At Waitemata's harbor, in the luxury suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you will find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches are sometimes busy and have a good range of shops along the coast. Swimming is not unsafe.
'Number One' is the most important local beer that is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to be found, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited for travel.
The local tap water can be safely consumed, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don't trust it.
A 'flat white' is a strange concept for Australians. Black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but great.
There are tours to the reef all year round and injuries as a result of these reef tours are rare.
Ask for expert advice nonetheless and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Cube jellyfish occur from October to April near beaches and river estuaries north of the Town of 1770. Sometimes they also occur outside of this period.
Sharks do occur, but they rarely attack people. The majority of sharks are afraid of people and would actually swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is located in the river mouths north of Rockhampton and they normally do not live in the ocean.
Booking in advance provides peace of mind for the traveler, knowing that he has a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually also book other types of accommodation, such as a camping spot, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transportation to and from the airport, and sometimes even packages with flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation if you need some more time to think about the offer or if you need to acquire documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
If you have a request or want to make a change, you must do this through the travel agency instead of the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of attendees at music festivals choose to camp on site and most visitors consider this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to be early to secure a camping spot near the music.
And remember the following: even if the music on the main stages has ended, there may be music playing in other parts of the festival grounds until late at night.
For families with young children, there are special camping areas at some festivals.
Pay close attention to where your cabin is located when crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, because the journey through the ice makes a tremendous noise if you are too close.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms and conditions).
Casinos generally strive to make the most out of the time and money that guests spend. Windows and clocks are usually not present, and the exit is sometimes hard to find.
They usually have special offers in the area of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and to prevent them from leaving.
Some locations offer free alcoholic drinks. However, when people are drunk, it affects their judgment, and all seasoned gamblers know that it is extremely important to stay sober.
If you go up high in the mountains or drive over mountain passes, you should take into account that there may be snow or ice and the temperature can be extremely low.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction and it drives differently than asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to become stuck.
Also, visibility can be obstructed by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and do not hinder traffic.
The biggest tourist attraction in Africa are safaris, which form the highlight of their trip for many visitors.
The term safari refers in popular use to traveling over land to view the magnificent African wild animals, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars and a standard equipment makes for a good view possible.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs and leopards, you will need a pair of binoculars. Otherwise, the chance of seeing them is small.
A walking safari (also called a 'forest walk' or 'loop safari') involves walking for several hours or days in a row.
The Paralympics are from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be played at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city where the Olympic Games have taken place twice. The first time was in 1964.
If you have already booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policy varies, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most tickets for events are expected to cost between ¥ 2,500 and ¥ 130,000. Regular tickets will cost around ¥ 7,000.
You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available. You can often borrow these items, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no iron available or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can also use a hair dryer, if available.
Make sure the fabric does not get too hot (this can cause the fabric to shrink or, in extreme cases, scorch).
You can purify water in different ways. Some methods are effective against specific risks.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, in other areas, water needs to be boiled for several minutes.
Not every filter is equally effective. In case of doubt, it is best to drink water from a sealed bottle from a reliable company.
Travelers may encounter animal plagues that are not present in their own country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.

Point Marion and Fairmont are connected via the Buffalo to Pittsburgh highway, often passing through desolate rural areas, making this route one big challenge.
Aren't you used to driving on country roads? Then keep your wits about you. You will encounter many steep slopes, narrow streets, and sharp turns.
The specified maximum speeds are significantly lower than in previous and consecutive areas - usually around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h - and it is even more important to adhere to them here than usual.
Surprisingly, you have much more coverage here than in other remote areas of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries taste great and in Bavaria, the pastries are quite rich and varied, just like the pastries of its southern neighbor, Austria.

But without additional information, the term refers to the food that originally comes from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine is now available throughout the archipelago and offers various simple spiced dishes. The most common Javanese flavorings are nuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese palm sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups support the rider's feet and hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can also bring safety problems as the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but remains caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged along with the horse. To reduce the risk, several safety measures have been taken.
Most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, narrow sole first and foremost.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety stirrups. This allows the stirrup leather to come loose from the saddle when pulled backwards because a rider falls off the horse.
Cochamó Valley - This is Chile's most popular climbing destination. It is known as the Yosemite of South America and has many different large granite walls and rocks.
The mountain peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes on the rock walls that seem to have endless potential.
Winter sports where you descend, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular. You slide down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard on your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, who are occasionally referred to as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations around skiing at a specific location.
Skiing has been around for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
The beginning of the sport of skiing dates back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It's not exactly the same, but it's similar to alpine skiing or mountain climbing, which is often done on steep terrain. Here, you need much sturdier skis and boots.
You can see the ski route as a hiking route.
In good conditions you can cover greater distances than on foot, but it is rare to reach the speed of cross-country skiing on prepared tracks without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, travelers have to apply for a visa multiple times and undergo passport controls when traveling between different countries.
The Schengen area, in this respect, functions almost like one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to undergo another passport control.
When you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen country, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition indicating which produced items are antique. Some tax offices define goods that are older than 100 years as antique.
The definition can vary by location. In North America, for example, the age limit is lower than in Europe.
It is possible to classify artisanal products as antiques, even though they are newer than comparable mass-produced items.
Among the Sámi, reindeer herding is an important form of livelihood. The culture around trading is also very important for many with other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry. They sustained themselves with fishing, hunting, and similar activities. Reindeer were usually used as draft animals for this purpose.
Many Sámi work in modern professions today. In Sápmi, the Sámi area, tourism is an important source of income.
The word 'gypsy' is mostly used by non-Roma. However, it is also often considered offensive because of the associations with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of the Roma.
If there is travel advice for the country you want to go to, this can have consequences for your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.

Advice only includes a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
They often provide a fleeting, general and extremely simplistic image compared to other, more detailed sources.
Emergency weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can lead to damage, serious societal disruption, or loss of life.

Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks that severe weather conditions in their area may bring, as these can also affect travel plans.
Everyone who wants to visit a country considered a warzone should be professionally trained.
A search for 'course in hostile environments' on the internet will likely result in the address of a local company.
In a course, normally all the issues set out here are treated in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role-playing, a lot of first aid training, and occasional weapon training.
There are many books and magazines with articles about surviving in the wilderness. However, there are only a few publications about war zones.
Travelers who have planned a gender reassignment surgery abroad should make sure they have the proper documentation for the return journey.
The variation is significant whether governments want to issue passports on which no gender (X) is stated, or to update a name or gender on documents.
There is just as much difference in the willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents.
Searches at security checks have also become much more extensive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery can assume that they will not emerge from this scan with their privacy and dignity intact.
"Mistral winds are the recurring waves that break on a reef or something similar and flow onto the beach."
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is located in some deeper parts, where rapid flow towards deep water can occur.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion from trying to swim against the current. This could easily be impossible.
Returning to the strong current is a piece of cake once you've escaped it.
Try to aim for a spot where you won't get caught again. Depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you can also wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than the culture shock (you have less of a 'honeymoon feeling'), it lasts longer, and it can be more intense.
Travelers who easily adapt to new cultures sometimes have difficulty readjusting to their own culture.
If you have lived abroad and then returned, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from your own culture in the process.
In the past, when you went abroad, you noticed that people were patient and understanding. They understood that travelers had to adapt to a new country.
Usually, patience and understanding are not expected for travelers returning home.
For children, the pyramid light and sound show is one of the most interesting activities in the neighborhood.
You see the pyramids in the dark and you see them in complete silence before the show begins.
The sound of sellers and tourists is often heard here. The story of the light and sound resembles that of a book.
The Sphinx forms the background and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes appear as a projection on the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids are illuminated.
The Southern Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have since been claimed by different countries. They have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island, and Deception. Here you will find the flooded crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is located on the southern side of the peninsula, near the border with the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, before reemerging to form the 360 km long mountain range Mount Ellsworth, which is crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif. Mount Vinson, at 4892 meters, is the highest mountain.
A satellite phone can be your only option in remote locations where there is no mobile phone reception.
A satellite phone is not really a replacement for a mobile phone, since you have to stand outside with a clear view of the satellite to be able to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, and for expeditions where there is a need for external data and communication.
Your local phone provider can provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
It is becoming increasingly popular for people planning a gap year to travel and learn.
Especially school leavers make use of this to take a gap year before university without negative consequences for their education.

Normally, tuition fee must be paid for the registration for these educational programs.
Finland is a fantastic destination for sailing. The 'Land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos off the coast.
A yacht is not necessary for the archipelagos or lakes.
The archipelagos along the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak, you get a completely different experience.
In Finland so many people sail in their free time that the ratio of boats to people is one to seven or eight.
The figure is equal to the figure of Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand. Furthermore, it is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg (Russia).
So you can spend some full days in the historic place and stay overnight on the ship.
Since 2009, you do not need a separate visa if you only go ashore during a boat excursion.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see on the map, Berlin is not close to the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be scary for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from many fears that other people also have.
If you understand how airplanes work, this can contribute to removing a fear that arises from the unknown or from the fact that you have no control over the airplane.
Courier companies receive a generous compensation to deliver items quickly. For business documents, merchandise or spare parts for a necessary repair, time often plays a very important role.
Larger companies were able to use their own airplanes for certain routes, but it became more difficult for other routes and smaller companies.
When they send things by air transport, it can take days on some routes before they are unloaded and cleared by customs.
Only as checked baggage could this be processed faster. According to the rules of airlines, there must be an accompanying passenger, and that would be you.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is by shelling out a bag of money for this privilege (or even better, getting your employer to do it).
However, this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times economy class for business, and about eleven times for first class.
It is usually not worthwhile to look for discounts on business class or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a group of pilots willing to pay a lot of money to fly somewhere quickly and comfortably, and the airlines therefore charge corresponding costs for this.
Chişinău is the Moldovan capital. Here the Romanian language is mainly spoken, but the Russian language is also widely used.
As a multi-ethnic republic, Moldova was burdened by an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in the east of Moldova. This republic has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by the members of the UN.
Economic ties have been reestablished between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failed political negotiations.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.

Premodern observatories are now outdated, and serve as museums or educational attractions.
Light pollution was not as big of a problem back then as it is today, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, more accessible than those of today.
Most modern research telescopes are massive facilities built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the viewing of cherry blossoms and has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flowers and that's where the concept came from.
The first cherry blossom festivals in Japan were organized by the emperor and were only intended for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.

Naturally, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could just as well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
In traditional churches, an Easter vigil is often held on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend. Here, congregations often celebrate a feast at exactly midnight in honor of the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that originally arrived at the islands came here by swimming, flying, or drifting.
Due to the long distance from the continent, it was not possible for mammals to make the journey. As a result, the giant tortoise became the most common grazing mammal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans set foot on the Galapagos, various mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
During the winter, the polar night occurs in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, which means that the sun does not actually rise.
