This is evidenced not only by the fact that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a popular theory, but it also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists say that the feathers of this animal were built chestnut from the top and the lower side pale or carotenoids-colored.
Discovery also gives a deep understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not contain a complete evolutionary vertebral chain, but possess other feather characteristics - such as protuberances and small protuberances - researchers concluded that the vertebral column was likely a later evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The wing structure indicates that they were not used for flight but for regulating temperature or for display. Researchers suggest that although this tail belongs to a small dinosaur, the sample shows fully developed feathers rather than a chick's posterior.
The researchers pointed out that despite this being the tail of a small dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of an adult bird, not chick feathers.

The influence that the team was searching for is attributed to the gravitational forces between dark matter in the Milky Way and dark matter in the Andromeda Galaxy.
Just as the moon's gravitational pull causes tides on Earth, the Milky Way galaxy's gravitational pull attracts the Andromeda galaxy.
Scientists have been able to infer that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that natural matter does.
This theory explains that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around it in a kind of halo, and consists of small particles in large numbers.

The proposed law project includes the requirement to place a label with "18" written on it on violent video games sold in the state of California, and to punish the sale to minors with a fine of $1000 for each offense.
The Public Prosecutor, Kir Starmer Q, issued a statement this morning announcing the trial of Hohne and Price.
He resigned and will be replaced in the cabinet by parliament member Ed Davis. It is expected that parliament member Norman Lamb will take over the position of Minister for Business, which Davis will leave.
They are scheduled to appear in Westminster Judges Court on the 16th of Safar.
Among the casualties were Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Codeback, 21 years old. Codeback was the driver.
Edgar Viegas was wounded in his arm and jaw, while Christopher Schneider needed reconstructive surgery for his face.
"Schneider" suffers from constant pain, blindness in one eye, and loss of part of the skull and face reconstructed with titanium, all of this happened while the "Oka" weapon failed while aimed at the head of a fifth man.
Schneider gave his testimony via a video link from a US air force base in his homeland.
After the Wednesday event, Carbanido competed in two individual races in the championship.
Her first race was the slalom skiing race, where she achieved a "did not finish" result in her first round. 36 out of 116 competitors achieved the same result in this race.
She witnessed her last race - the giant slalom skiing race - securing the tenth place in the women's sitting group with a time of 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 slower than the Austrian Claudia Lösch who won the first place, and 1:09.02 slower than the Hungarian Gyongyi Dani who placed ninth.
Four skiers on the disabled team failed to complete their runs, and 45 out of 117 female skiers in the giant slalom race failed to place.
Muhayya police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phones.
Deputy Inspector General Di.K. Aria said, "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and confiscated her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the suspects are Baba Kangar, Butha Kangar, Rambr Kangar, Ghaza Kangar, and Vishnu Kangar.
The police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the suspects appeared in court with covered faces.
Despite the presence of three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
But the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the collision occurred has been temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from a red Audi TT.
He had been admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth at the outset.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adikeya became a suspect in the murder of her son at the Sheriff's Court in Edinburgh.
She is detained awaiting formal charges and trial, but any evidence from a dubious eyewitness could be questionable as her image has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice in other places in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have considered that publishing the photos could be biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee suggests that "it seems to me that journalists are definitely treading on dangerous ground if they publish photos or similar identifying information about suspects."
The responsible Taj office generally indicated to journalists that there will be no further comments until at least the accusation is made.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants, which are based on pre-1387AH war borders in the Middle East.
Other topics that are said to have been covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is considered an important issue for both peoples, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands the continuous military presence in the Jordan Valley for a period of ten years, once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to the continuation of this presence for only five years.
The guards should have closely supervised the handlers in the supplementary pest control experiment, as the experiment was under monitoring and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
Volunteers with the necessary qualifications were selected as part of the hunting program, in a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting manager of the NPWS park and heritage preservation organization, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Martelly took the oath yesterday in a new temporary Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
It is the fifth interim electoral council for Martelly within four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the interim election council as part of a series of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in Shawwal.
Protests erupted, sometimes violently, due to the failure to hold the scheduled elections since 1432 AH.
About 60 cases of overheating in "iPod" devices have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people sustaining minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional cases of exhaustion incidents, which the company labeled as "non-serious."
The ministry responded to Apple's request to postpone the report as "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (Friday 12:19 AM Mecca time).
The Emergency Management Office in Northern Mariana stated that no damages have been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has stated that there are no indications of a possible tsunami wave occurring.
A former Filipino policeman took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their private bus in the city of Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
He saved many hostages and confirmed the killing of at least six so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, as well as Filipino photographers, were released early.
The photographers later took the place of the elderly lady because she needed to go to the bathroom. And Mendoza was shot.
He followed in his father's footsteps and chose medicine as his profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and then started working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in the year 1379 AH.
"Legenzz" started investigating premature birth during his free time, while working at the hospital.
He has shown through his research that giving one of the hormones will accelerate the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
"Xinhua" reported that government investigators recovered the flight recorders, or "black boxes," on Wednesday.
The colleagues praised Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first extreme queen. My first manager, Luna passed away on the night of the moons. A strong woman, one of a kind."
"Joldst" Reynolds commented: "Luna was eccentric like me... maybe even more than me... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Among 1,400 people included in the pre-federal election poll for the year 1431 AH, the percentage of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 1429 AH.
During the 1431 Federal Election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of those surveyed agree with this perspective and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
Regarding the opposing sides in the survey, 29% of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The fitness of the Olympic gold medalist in physical fitness is being doubted due to his complaint, as he was supposed to swim 100m and 200m freestyle and in three stages in the Commonwealth Games.
He could not take the necessary medications to overcome the pain as their use is prohibited in sports.
Kurtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, discovered the largest known prime number to date on 25th of Muharram.
Several individuals verified the discovery using different devices and programs at the beginning of the month of Safar, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Perhaps the comets were a source of bringing water to the earth alongside organic materials that can form proteins and support life.
The scientists hope to understand how planets form, particularly how the earth formed from the collision of comets with the earth in ancient times.
Komo, 53, began his rule early this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He said about the rumors that they are "political chatter and silliness".
It is likely that he will run for presidency in the year 1437AH.
NextGen is a system claimed by the Federal Aviation Administration to allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, as well as save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
She uses technology associated with satellites, unlike the old technology that uses ground radar to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the location of the aircraft and provide pilots with more specific information.
There are no additional transportation options and the ground trains will not stop at Wembley, in addition to the lack of car parks and ground parking facilities.
The fear of limited transportation and the possibility of having to hold the match behind closed doors without the presence of the team's supporters raised concerns.
The study mentioned in the article published on Thursday in the journal "Science" about the emergence of a new type of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have found that the development of new species took only two generations - despite previous beliefs that this process would take much longer - due to interbreeding among the resident Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch, the immigrant cactus finch, and the sharp-beaked ground finch.
Gold can be molded into various shapes. It can be rolled into small forms.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be wound and braided. It can be hammered or wound in the shape of leaves.
It can be made very thin, and attached to another metal. And it can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "Illuminated Manuscripts".
It is called the pH value of the chemical substance, and you can make an indicator for this value using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (H+ in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons lacking electrons (where hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the dry powders together and then squeeze them with clean damp hands until they form into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will interact with the outer layers, giving you a strange sensation and forming a kind of covering.
My city of Haraba and Mohinjo had a toilet with a drainage system in almost every household connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the homes of the towns of Minoan in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, the toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women would attend together in mixed company.
When you connect with someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and visibility.
It requires a giant rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to put a satellite or telescope in space.
The invention of the wheel has dramatically changed the world; but providing an easier and faster means of transportation remains its most important contribution to us.
The train, the car, and many other transport devices have been brought to us.
There are more medium-sized cats below them that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to deer and antelope.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray pets) that eat the most common small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success secret is the concept of status, and each cat has a specific job that prevents it from competing with others.
The black cats are the most social and live in large groups called colonies.
The lion family consists of one to three adult males, in addition to up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closer to each other, as they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion pride acts like a wolf or dog pack, and the surprising thing is that the animals are similar to the lion (but not to other big cats) in behavior and very deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, leap long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as loud as the roar of a full-grown lion, but it is closer to a snarl with angry words.
The Arabian leopard likes to eat small animals, so it hunts monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if it can. Almost all the animals that the Arabian leopard hunts are smaller in size.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find their prey using their sense of smell; they sniff out where they were on the ground.
She can see well in the dark through night vision, and move very stealthily as well. She hunts for her prey by blending in with her surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population to which they belong (for example if they moved across a mountain range or river, or moved to a new island where they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were in before.
Due to the new environment containing different resources and competitors, the new group will need different qualities or adaptability methods to become a stronger competitor compared to what it needed previously.
There has been no change to the original inhabitants at all, so they still need the same adaptation methods as we are used to with them.
Over time, as new residents start to adapt to their new environment, their similarity to other residents gradually decreases.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will appear to be different to the extent that we cannot call them the same type.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is considered an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is also from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The apex predator of his time, the tyrannosaurus rex had no fear except for other tyrannosaurs.
The long tusks were studded with more than 70 teeth resembling blades in addition to another set in the roof of its mouth, meaning there is no escape for anything standing in its way.
We are not certain, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and he may have been a carnivore.
As she attacked everything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex compared to her.
While most of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans have their share of exotic or unusual holiday elements, including wild boars, peacocks, geckos, and a type of rodent called zaghba.
There was another contrast, that while the poor and women were eating their food while sitting on the benches, the wealthy men enjoyed holding feasts together where they reclined on their sides while eating their meals.
It was not possible for the ancient Roman meals to include the foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and they did not taste any of the old Roman turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to fulfill the needs of the gods during the celebrations and festivals.
For each temple, there is an open courtyard leading to a secure chamber that only priests can enter.
Sometimes unique towers shaped like pyramids, called ziqura, were built to be part of temples.
The summit of the mountain was a safe haven for the deity.
In the warm Middle Eastern climate, the home was not of great importance.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women used to cook in the courtyard; the shops were just open fronts facing the street. Stone was used in building the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
The people inhabited Greenland separately. It is told in Scandinavian sagas that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland on a charge of murder, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of its discovery, the Inuit tribes used to live there previously.
There were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history in the countries of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, despite each country being "Scandinavian".
If you had watched the National Treasure movie, you might think that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But this is not true. Despite something written on the back of the document, it is not a map of treasure.
The original declaration of independence was written on the back of the independence announcement with the date of 18 Jumada al-Awwal 1190H. The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Despite the fact that the author of this portion of the text is specifically unknown, we know that the large manuscript (measuring 29¾ inches × 24½ inches) was originally stored folded at the beginning of its existence.
Therefore, it is likely that the symbol was simply added as an identifier.
The landing operations on D-Day and the subsequent battles led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was not yet liberated.
He ruled France "Vichy". These are the French people who made peace with the Germans in the year 1359 AH and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On the 15th of Sha'ban, 1359 AH, the Allies invaded the south of France, and the invasion was named "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
Civilization is a collective individual culture shared among a large group of people who live and work cooperatively in a society.
The origin of the word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civiles", which means "civil" and is related to the Latin "civis", which means "citizen", and "civitatis", meaning "city or state of the city", and this also defines the social mass in a way.
Independent self-sustaining cities are the ancestors of nations. Cultural civilization inherently means transferring knowledge across multiple generations, leaving a cultural imprint and spreading knowledge fairly.
The small cultures often fade away without leaving any real historical evidence and are not recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the revolutionary war, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with the Congress being the only element in it - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any authority to impose taxes, and due to the absence of a national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the state authorities, which were mostly uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
In addition, you do not have the authority to bypass tax laws and tariffs imposed between states.
The materials required unanimous approval from all states before being modified, and the states mocked the central government to the extent that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in the year 1427 AH.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands owned by Japan, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago"
Taiwan began its return journey in the fifteenth century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1633, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan and began to change the practices of original grain production and employing Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar farms.
In the year 1094 AH, the armies of the Qing dynasty (1053-1330) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in the year 1302 AH.
In the year 1312 AH, and after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War between 1311 and 1312 AH, the Qing government signed the Shimonooski Treaty, through which it relinquished its sovereignty over Taiwan in favor of Japan, which ruled the island until the year 1364 AH.
The city of Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, which are Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings located on the outskirts of the complex are being rebuilt in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By the year 1396 AH, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration work has continued to this day.
For example, the most common format for capturing still images in the world is 35 millimeters, which was the dominant size of film at the end of the era of analog film.
Its production is still ongoing until the present day, but more importantly, the image sensor in digital cameras has inherited the aspect ratio of the image width to its height.
The 35mm model is a bit confusing in reality, as it is 36mm wide and 24mm high.
And therefore, the aspect ratio of this image (when divided by 12 to obtain the ratio of the simplest integer number) will be 3:2.
Many common formats (a set of formats advanced image system, for example) are equal or close to this aspect ratio of width to height.
The Trinity rule, which is often misused and mocked, serves as a simple guiding principle that creates dynamism while maintaining a level of order in a clear manner.
It is worth mentioning that the most influential place for the main topic is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
The Catholic Church, which has become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny during this period of European history.
The Christian religion has connected European countries together for over a thousand years despite differences in language and customs.
The comprehensive strength that I possessed affected everyone, from the king to the ordinary people.
One of the key Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that cash donations to the church are specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church in Rome lasted for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question the extent of fidelity to the requirements of the faith.
Britain quickly moved to blockade Germany by sea after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy has proven its effectiveness; cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, despite the violation of this blockade of the generally accepted international law, which was documented and coordinated in several international agreements during the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sectors of the oceans, which even threatens neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevalent attitudes among most citizens and nations were peaceful and isolationist.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the first world war, countries wanted to avoid this situation again in the future.
In the year 1301 AH, Tesla moved to the United States of America to work with Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient Chinese had a unique way of presenting different time periods; each stage of China or each dynasty in power was of a different type.
In addition, there was a period of instability among the divided provinces between each ruling dynasty. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
A fierce war broke out during these periods between many nobles vying for the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest eras in the ancient history of China, thousands of people died during the fighting in order to sit on the highest seats in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political impacts such as the use of the metric system, the transition from dictatorship to a republican system, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just the ruler.
After the revolution, professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same thing applies to the army because instead of the army being based on class, it is now based on weapons.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class individuals in other countries to ignite their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that transcend this worldly life. He used to frequent the cave known as "Hira" on top of the mountain "Nur" for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has remained throughout the ages, provides a very vivid picture of the spiritual inclinations of Prophet Muhammad.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it is not easy to find it at all, even if you know of its existence. Once you enter the cave, you become completely isolated.
Nothing can be seen except the clear beautiful sky above the many surrounding mountains. Only very little of this world inside the cave can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid in Giza Governorate is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands to this day.
It was built by the Egyptians in the third century of the current era, the Great Pyramid is considered one of the huge pyramids built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid) as well as smaller tombs, temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many other pyramids, tombs, and smaller temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" mark looks like the letter V and the "down bow" mark looks like a staple or a square without the bottom side of it.
The upper mark indicates the need to start from the top and push the bow, while the lower mark indicates the need to start from the end of the bow (where your hand holds the bow) and pull it.
The upper bow usually produces a smoother sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more robust.
Do not hesitate to make your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the printed curved marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
Terrified, King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette, along with their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris by a crowd of unruly market women on the 17th of Muharram in the year 1204 AH.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a large crowd of people who were screaming and shouting against the king and queen.
A group of spectators managed to force the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide open.
One of the gang members at some point gestured with the head of one of the slain royal guards at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The Filipino people bore the expenses of the United States' imperialistic war in its invasion of the Philippines.
These had to pay taxes to the American colonial system to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Filipino government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the excessive profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people will constitute the main gains for American imperialism.
We need to understand the context driving the creation of the organization, in order to accommodate the knights of the temple.
The era in which those events took place was known as the High Middle Ages, which is the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (390 AH - 700 AH).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 893 AH.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from pushing technology or technological necessity to the strict feeling that human destiny is driven by a basic logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
There are two common ideas shared in most interpretations of technological determinism: that the evolution of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that this technology in turn has "effects" on rooted societies, rather than being linked to the society.
For example, one might say that car engines necessarily lead to the development of roads.
But building a network of roads extending throughout the country is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new roads are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The collective ownership of cars also leads to an increase in the accident rate on the roads, leading to the invention of new medical techniques for treating damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural necessity derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romantic movement, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to that geography emerged, and those individuals, being in harmony with the society's place, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
As Paris is famous for being the fashion capital in the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the center of luxury began in 400 AD and lasted until 493 AD.
Its condition declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusades had returned, bringing gifts such as silk, spices, and other valuable items that were of higher value than what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time, the title of fashion capital was given to Paris instead of Constantinople.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th or 11th century to the 14th century.
At the beginning, Byzantine culture had a strong influence on Eastern clothing.
Despite that, due to the slow channels of communication, Western trends may be delayed by approximately 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments at that time as a result of the Crusades, people began using buttons to fasten clothing.
The cultivation of subsistence is the cultivation that is carried out to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family only.
The subsistence agriculture, which is often organic, is considered a simple system using stored seeds that are suitable for the region's ecosystem, in addition to crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at increasing output.
Most farmers historically worked in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected due to societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
Perhaps the characteristics that define the distinction of a subculture are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, national, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures indicate their membership through the use of various symbolic styles including clothing, behavior, and dialect.
One of the most common ways used to emphasize the importance of social upbringing is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have suffered from neglect, misfortune, or deliberate harm, and are not socially connected to adults during their upbringing.
These children are referred to as "feral" or. Some stray children have been confined by individuals (usually their parents); in some cases, abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of the severe mental or physical disability of the child.
Maybe children with special needs were subjected to mistreatment during childhood or severe traumas before being abandoned or running away.
And others are claimed to have been raised by animals; while some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When raised by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits (within physical limits) behaviors that closely resemble those of a special care animal, such as fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more engaging, the support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning is not a method of learning, but rather a helpful tool that provides support to individuals going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual and real, in another sense, the teacher is a form of interactive learning, as well as a paper clip in Microsoft Office.
Interactive learning is supported internally in the program and aims to raise questions, motivate, and explain procedures that may be difficult for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from neglect and abuse to even exploitation.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not based on nurturing, care, and education, but they do.
We realize that the alternative care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Alternative care must provide all the necessities that were lacking in the homes they previously left.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and personal interaction.
The distinctive features of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage approaches and methods of satisfaction.
For example, some suggest "learning" and "socialization" as important motives for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
The "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were identified as new motivational aspects by Emi and McCord (1998) when they studied audience response on websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting subtle facial expressions, which are facial movements that last for a few fractions of a second.
. It is claimed in particular that one can discover whether a person is lying by interpreting facial expressions accurately.
Oliver Sachs pointed out in his paper that the President's speech indicates that individuals with aphasia due to brain damage are able to accurately assess sincerity.
Indeed, it suggests the idea that these abilities in analyzing human behavior are shared with some animals, such as pet dogs.
Studies in the 20th century have shown the existence of two groups of genetic variations: a hidden group and another visible one.
The mutation adds new genetic variations, and natural selection removes them from the pool of expression variations.
The process of separation and reassembly works to make the contrast randomly fluctuate between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for primates with a digestive system similar to humans to meet their requirements for amino acids from available plant resources.
Failure to do so will lead to dire consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The plant resources that are easily accessible in abundance are proteins that can be obtained from leaves and legumes, but these proteins are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, animal foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide high quantities of proteins and contain all essential amino acids.
When taking all things into consideration, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved "the protein problem" in their own way similar to the way chimpanzees do it in the savannah.
Disruption of sleep is the deliberate awakening during your natural sleep period and sleeping after a short period (10 to 60 minutes).
And this can be easily done using a relatively gentle alarm to bring you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which forces you to get out of bed to stop it.
Other options include, based on biological systems, drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known diuretics) before bed, forcing the person to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person possesses is inversely related to the level of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the stress, the more the positivity that the power of life provides increases. Every individual has the inherent ability to find peace and complete satisfaction.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that holds us back on the path to this goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has expanded through the path of Mahayana love and other Indian yoga techniques.
Tibetan Buddhism is extremely simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that embraces everyone.
The "Kundalini" energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, chants, and visualizations, with "Kundalini Yoga".
The Tibetan Meditation Center is the God of Yoga. Through visualizing the different deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and enlightenment awareness is created.
Germany represented a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. However, with the end of the war, clashes of systems, procedures, and cultures led to the outbreak of conflict between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the cold war began.
This war was supposed to continue for the next forty years, with proxy armies fighting on the ground in battlefields from Africa to Asia, as well as in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By the 17th of Ramadan in the year 1358 AH, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman bridge.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for transporting goods is the most effective way to transport large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The tradition is that the role of the naval forces is to ensure your country's ability to transport its people and goods, while at the same time, intercepting your enemy's ability to transport its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, where the Americans attempted to transport individuals and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to repel this invasion using submarines.
If the allies had failed, Germany would most likely have been able to invade Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time nearly 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Goats were generally raised in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended to by goat herders who were mostly children or teenagers, similar to the widely known shepherd. These herding methods are still used today.
Carriage roads were established in England as early as the 16th century.
Although old railway cars were made only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and carry heavier loads compared to the roads that were considered more rugged at that time.
The train tracks' bars were invented relatively early to hold the tracks in place, but it became evident over time that placing an iron strip on top of the track makes it more efficient.
That has become a common practice, however, the iron has led to further corrosion of the wooden wheels of the carts.
In the end, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In the year 1181 AH, the first complete iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first means of transportation, humans began walking upright two million years ago coinciding with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk in a straight and consistent manner.
Two-legged species were found in Australopithecus excavations from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in a way that is more sustainable to the environment, and we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists for reducing future hardships to some extent.
This is exactly like treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems, and we must end it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed significantly due to scientific and technological advances for humanity, and problems have become bigger due to the increase in population and the luxurious lifestyle of humans.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlop Cash Notes".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on the eighth of Rajab.
One of them was sent to George Washington on the sixth of Rajab, and he read it to his forces in New York on the ninth of Rajab. A copy of it reached London on the tenth of Sha'ban.
The parchment scrolls of the Dunlap Broadside represent the oldest surviving copies of the American Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten version did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a single group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people think of it as a dinosaur because it has feathers and can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
She has feet with outer protective layers and claws, she lays eggs, and walks on her hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus.
All computer devices used today rely on processing encrypted information in the form of binary numbers.
The value of a binary digit can only be one of two values, which are 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers - or bits, if we use computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not show symptoms immediately. Immediate diagnosis cannot be based on the appearance of common symptoms such as vomiting.
The presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals may be the best indicator of internal poisoning.
Check the label to know the first aid guidelines for the specific poison.
Insect scientists use the term "bedbug" in its official sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term is derived from the ancient knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects that have greatly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both the "assassin bug" and the "bed bug" are characterized by a long incubation period, and they adapt to living in a nest or their host's residence.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it one of the most prevalent neurological diseases among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that the chance of females getting multiple sclerosis is twice as high as males.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest or the best interest of their child to raise a newborn baby.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their children.
As part of the adoption process, the birth parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can care for the child.
The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through a scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
Despite this, it is not unique in this matter. Experimentation and experience are considered a test that can be used to refute one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
The natural scientists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, particularly the Gospel in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in the science of organ functions and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue for periods of consecutive cycles even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
Use Hershey and Chase's bacteriophages or viruses to introduce their own DNA into the bacteria.
They performed two experiments, either labeling the DNA using radioactive phosphorus or labeling its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation and the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ line cells.
Mutations can only be passed on to children in germ line cells, while mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife and vegetation.
The examples include activities that can be done on the site such as hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting gardens, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing, and learning information about this type of monkey (organgatuangs) in Borneo.
People leave the small towns in their cars every morning to go to their workplaces, and they meet others on the way who work in the place they just left.
In this vibrant transportation system, everyone is somewhat connected to a transport system based on private cars.
The science now indicates that this carbon-dependent economy has disrupted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human development over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation systems. Everyone complains about the transportation systems.
Seldom do you hear in advanced countries similar levels of complaints about the quality of water or the collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems like these encounter complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are the transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
Traffic movement is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic movement is difficult because it is not possible to predict the driver's behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range of consistency; thus, traffic flows reasonably smoothly and can be approximately expressed as sportsmanship.
To better understand the flow of traffic, relationships were established between the three main properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
The insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them to easily escape from enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are characterized by their ability to fold their wings backward along the length of their body.
And this gives them a greater range of small places to hide from predatory animals.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings today are the dragonfly and the mayfly.
For thousands of years, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some see him as right, but many people believe the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
This seems logical, because you don't feel the earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries water eight times more than the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, reaching a width of up to 6 miles at times.
20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It gathers water from thousands of small rivers.
Despite the continued construction of the stone pyramids until the end of the ancient Egyptian kingdom, the pyramids in Giza did not surpass them in terms of size and architectural distinction.
The ancient Egyptians in the modern kingdom were amazed by the artifacts of their ancestors, which have been preserved for over a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is around 800, making it the smallest independent state in the world with the fewest population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of daily life used by most workers in the country, while Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the existence of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, where all these elements can be found in nature in their original form and can be relatively easily extracted using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle assumed that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of the four elements, which are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, despite also assuming that they transform into new materials to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered minerals. And of course, there are also minerals like silver and gold.
You can also obtain alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is created from matter. All materials are created from small particles called atoms.
The particles are so small that trillions of them can fit into the space at the end of this sentence.
And thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing tools, the pencil has been replaced with less status and usage.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, without the need to use a sharpener.
The person can only wonder about what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along.
The nuclear bomb works by gathering energy to form a core full of protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. The nucleus splits again and releases a portion of that energy.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with or without slight movement.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust thickness reaches about 70 kilometers on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
He is thinnest under moonlit seas and fattest under highlands.
There may be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface.
The theories of content revolve around finding what excites or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs or desires that emerge spontaneously when they reach maturity.
These theories examine the thing that makes some people want the things they do and the things in their surrounding environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Two common theories of content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former peers, one of which is an attempt to "fit in" with the others.
This type of manager faces difficulty in making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, determining responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the contrary, the individual turns into an unrecognizable person who feels the need to change everything the team was doing and possessing it.
In the end, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical groups.
And often they have greater independence than members of traditional teams, as their teams may come together according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a "shadow team" was described as a unique component of a virtual team (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p109).
Every member submits their reports to the "Invisible Team" of management, where the "Invisible Team" sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to establish an educational organization that consumes a long time? Innovation is considered one of the goals of implementing institutional learning concepts.
When utilizing all available resources effectively across the functional departments in the organization, creativity and innovation can be achieved.
As a result, collaboration within the organization can lead to the emergence of new innovative procedures that meet the client's needs.
Before the organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
"Angel (2006) explains continuity as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance."
The data related to neuroscience provides tangible evidence for the theoretical approach in seeking knowledge. It works to narrow down the research area and make it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain science and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that the different types of brain damage, shocks, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore the structure and processes of the brain in a way we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Despite the strong association of artificial intelligence with science fiction, it is actually a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
The search in artificial intelligence includes creating machines to perform tasks automatically that require intelligent behavior.
The examples include control, planning, scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and face.
I have become such things separate fields that focus on providing solutions for real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now being used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being used to build several software applications on home computers and video games.
Field trips are a big part of any academic semester. Often, the teacher may enjoy taking her students to places that are considered inaccessible by bus.
Technology enables the solution through virtual field trips. Students can see the archaeological pieces in the museum or visit the fish tank or enjoy fine art while sitting with their classmates in the classroom.
Participating in a virtual field trip is a great way to relive a specific trip and exchange experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Benet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned every year, but old versions are kept online as a record.
Blogs can help improve students' writing. While students typically start their blogging experience with unrefined grammar and spelling, having an audience generally changes that.
And since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts striving to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Just as blogs "force students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to feed public interest inspires students to be skilled and useful (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can "enable students to become more analytical and critical; and through effective response to material on the internet, students can articulate their positions within the context of others' writings as well as articulate their own views on specific issues (O'Rourke, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada which includes a variety of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is located in the far south, and to the north is the beautiful unexploited nature house in Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered the essence of Canada by outsiders.
The large areas in the north are somewhat sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited.
In comparison of the population census that amazes many: the number of African American residents in the United States is more than the number of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
The island of Madagascar is the largest of all, and it is a separate continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent countries, or are associated with France, and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country, and it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonization began in the fifteenth century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a route from Europe to India.
From the north, the African coast borders the region, and it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean from the south and west.
Women: regardless of their actual social status, female travelers should declare that they are married.
It is prestigious to wear a ring, but not the one that looks very expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they may perceive as harassment, and that it is common for them to be observed and held by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and do not be afraid to stick to your position (do not let cultural differences be acceptable!).
The Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids used the modern city of Casablanca as a strategic port called "Anfa" after it was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name "Casa Branca", only to abandon it after the 1168 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city with the name of Daru Al Badia, and the Spanish traders gave it the name of Casablanca when they established trade bases there.
Casablanca is considered one of the least exciting places for shopping in all parts of Morocco.
It is easy to find places to sell traditional Moroccan goods all over the old city, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookah, and all kinds of cheap goods, but all of this is intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In the year 1423 AH, Goma was destroyed due to the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Any visits outside of "Goma" must be researched to understand the ongoing fighting situation in the northern "Kivu" province, while "Goma" is reasonably safe.
The city also serves as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and some of the cheapest ways to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can ride the Boda Boda (a motorbike that operates as a taxi) to tour the city of Goma, and the usual price (locally) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Beside its relative difficulty to access, "Timbuktu" has become used as a figurative term for faraway and exotic lands.
In our time, the city of Timbuktu is considered a poor city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, in addition to having an airport.
In the year 1411 AH, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites, due to the threat of desert sands.
One of the main stops for Henry Louis Gates in the PBS series about the wonders of the African world.
The city stands out starkly from the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arab character than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeast South Africa, along the borders of Mozambique to the east, and Zimbabwe to the north, and is bordered to the south by the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is considered one of the attractive areas in South Africa and is also considered a major park of the national parks in South Africa (South African National Parks).
There are daily fees to maintain the park and enter it, like all national parks in South Africa.
It may be useful to buy a Wild Card, as it allows you to access a selected group of South African parks or all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives the region its name, and it is the place that many tourists consider their destination.
The selected buildings that outline the skyline of Hong Kong resemble a dazzling graphical chart shining above the waters of Victoria Harbour.
In order to get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the waterfront in Kowloon on the opposite side.
The overwhelming majority of urban development in Hong Kong is concentrated densely on reclaimed land along the northern shoreline.
This is the place that the British colonizers have taken as their own special place, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the region, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is considered the largest coastal belt for mangrove plants in the world, extending for 80 kilometers (50 miles) in remote areas of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just swamps of mangrove trees; they contain some of the last remnants of dense jungles that once covered the plain of the Ganges River.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometers, almost a third of which is covered by water/swamps.
Since 1385 AH, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and estimates indicate that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses leave the inner station between regions (across the river) within the day, although most of them, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bogor, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because buses between neighborhoods are often full, it is better to buy tickets in advance a few days before.
Most areas are served by small Japanese "Coaster" buses, which are comfortable and powerful.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Baro (Nu 150) and Bunaha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It stretches over the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the two towers is 83 meters, and their length is 378 meters, and they have two tracks with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in Shaban 1432H, and was not opened to traffic until the first of Rabia Al-Awwal 1438H.
It is expected that the bridge will begin full operation in Ramadan 1438 AH, at the same time it is expected to complete the Brazilian customs inspection points.
The "Guarani" were the most important indigenous group that inhabited what is now known as Eastern Paraguay, the "Guarani" lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting animals, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, which used to be known as the "Giant Province of the Indies" due to the confrontation between the Spanish invaders and the indigenous population.
The Spanish started the colonial era that lasted for three centuries.
Since its establishment in 943 AH, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competitions of the year are held in Dhu al-Hijjah, at the polo fields in Las Canitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches can be watched here at other times of the year.
To get news about tournaments and information on where to buy polo match tickets, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), whose value is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island of Stanley on the other side of the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere in the islands and inside Stanley credit cards, and US dollars are often accepted.
In remote islands, there is a possibility that credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to know the accepted payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so money should be exchanged before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, the summer season there occurs when it's winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical regions; it is common for temperatures to exceed 30 degrees Celsius in the summer months.
The winter may be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes the weather feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The amount of rainfall remains relatively constant throughout the year, with no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons.
Despite many animals in the park being used to seeing humans, wild life is ultimately wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how easy it may seem for them to be tamed, bison, elk, moose, and bears, and nearly all large animals, can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year for not staying at a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and are considered dangerous, so they must be given their own space.
In addition, be careful because the scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong smells and maintain the cleanliness of the camp.
The capital of Samoa is the city of Apia. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Abia was founded in the 1850s and was the official capital of Samoa since 1379 AH.
The port was a site of notorious naval confrontations in 1306 AH when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank except for one British battleship. Around 200 American and German individuals drowned.
During the struggle organized by the Mau movement for independence, the peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the killing of the supreme leader Topowa Temasisis Lelofi III.
Because "Auckland" is located between two harbors, there are many beaches, with the most popular ones located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and allow for safe swimming, and most of them are shaded by palm trees.
The beaches of Takapuna are situated on the Waitemata Harbor, in the outskirts of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded with a good range of shops lining the beach. Swimming is safe.
The basic popular beer is known as "Number One"; it is not a complex drink, but rather a enjoyable and refreshing beverage. Other local beers are called "Manta."
The types of French wine are numerous, but New Zealand and Australian wine may be more popular.
The tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. The small black coffee is "espresso", while the cappuccino has a layer of cream (not foam) on top, and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate fulfills Belgian standards. Fruit juices are excellent despite being expensive.
Many trips are organized to the coral reefs throughout the year, and injuries to the coral reefs rarely occur for any of these reasons.
With that, seek advice from authorities, obey all signals, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish can be found near beaches and river mouths from October to April in the north of 1770. It can sometimes be found at other times.
Shark attacks do occur, but they are rarely aimed at humans. Most sharks are actually afraid of humans and will swim away if they see one.
Saltwater crocodiles usually do not live in the ocean; their main habitat is located in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
The advance reservation reassures the traveler that he will have a place to stay as soon as he arrives at his intended destination.
Despite the possibility of finding other forms of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agent, travel agents often have deals with specific hotels.
The custom is to offer travel agents packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even all-inclusive packages that include flights and hotels.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any modifications or requests must be directed through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of attendees at music festivals choose to camp on site, considering it an important part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the events, you should enter early to get a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that even though music at the main stages may be over, there are sections of the festival that may continue playing music until late at night.
Some festivals include designated camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea area in winter, you should check the cabin location, as ice traffic causes very noisy disturbances for the most vulnerable people.
Saint Petersburg sea cruises include spending some time in the city. Passengers of sea cruises are exempt from entry visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to increase the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and it can be difficult to find exits.
They have a habit of special meals, drinks, and entertainment offers to maintain the good mood of the guests and keep them in the building.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks, but alcohol hinders proper judgment and teaches all good gamblers the importance of staying conscious.
Anyone driving their car at high altitudes or across mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow or ice falling, or temperatures dropping below zero.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were driving on smooth asphalt.
And during snowstorms, enough snow may fall to temporarily stop you.

Safari trips may be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most prominent for many visitors.
The term "safari trips" is usually used to refer to traveling across countries to see the amazing wildlife in Africa, especially in the savannas.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles closely and standard equipment will allow for good viewing.
The lions, tigers, and leopards sometimes feel shy and you can see them better using binoculars.
Safari on foot (also called "hiking" or "walking safari") consists of walking long distances, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 16th to 28th Muharram in the year 1443 Hijri, and some of the events will take place at secondary locations in various parts of Japan.
After hosting the Olympic Games in 1383 AH, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for the year 1441 AH before the announcement of the postponement, you may face an awkward situation.
Policies for cancellations vary, but as of late Rabi' al-Awwal, most cancellation policies based on the coronavirus were no longer in effect until Rajab of the year 1441 AH, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, while the typical regular ticket cost will be around 7,000 yen.
The iron helps in drying wet clothes. Many hotels provide an iron and ironing board for rent, even if they are not available in the room.

There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas, boiling the water for a minute is sufficient, while in other areas, it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
The filters differ in effectiveness; if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in tightly sealed bottles from a reputable company.
It is likely that travelers will encounter animal pests they are not familiar with in their native areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause annoyance, or trigger allergic reactions in worst cases, and spread toxins or transmit infections.
The same infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not usually described as pests.
Shopping in the duty-free market is an opportunity to purchase tax-free merchandise in designated areas.
Travelers heading to countries that impose high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on the expenses for products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont features the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, as it regularly crosses through isolated forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be cautious: there are always steep slopes, narrow passages, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than they were in previous and subsequent sections - typically 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) - and strict obedience to them is more important than anything else.
It seems strange that mobile phone service appears to be stronger here than in many other areas along the road, such as the forests of Pennsylvania.
The German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and diverse, resembling the pastries of its southern neighbor, Austria.

Indonesian food represents a comprehensive term that includes a wide range of regional cuisines spread across different areas of Indonesia, due to the presence of 17,000 islands in Indonesia that differ from each other.
However, if used without additional terms, the term tends to mean that the food originates from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Available now on a wide scale throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a variety of simply seasoned dishes, the prevalent flavors preferred by Javanese are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The pommel is considered to be the support for the rider's feet, dangling on either side of the saddle.
It provides more stability for the horse, but it may have safety concerns due to the possibility of the horse getting its feet caught in them.
If the rider falls off the horse but their foot remains stuck in the stirrup, they may be dragged if the horse runs away. There are a number of precautions that can be taken to mitigate this risk.
First, most horsemen wear high-heeled, narrow-soled riding boots.
Secondly, some saddles, especially English saddles, contain safety bars that allow the rider's stirrup to fall from the saddle when pulled back as the rider dismounts.

Snow sports on slopes, including skiing and ice skating, are popular sports involving sliding down a patch of snow-covered ground using skis or ice skates attached to your feet.
Skiing is considered a main activity during travel and has a large number of enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan to spend entire vacations centered around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - dating back to cave paintings depicting skiers as far back as 5000 BC!
The history of skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1278 AH the first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Skiing with a backpack: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or long-distance walking on ice.
It is associated with skiing in the Alps or mountain climbing, but it usually does not involve ice skiing or mountain climbing, as they are practiced on steep terrain and require more rigid skis and long boots.
Think of ice skating as a similar path to long-distance walking.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover longer distances by walking to some extent, but you will rarely reach the speeds of long-distance skiing without a heavy backpack and on equipped tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it includes many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries means you will have to go through visa applications and passport checks several times.
Despite that, the Schengen area operates to some extent as a single country in this matter.
As long as you remain in this area, you can generally cross the border without needing to pass through passport checkpoints again.
Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for entry visas for each individual member state of the Schengen countries, thereby saving time, money, and paperwork.
Some tax agencies define antiques as goods that are over a hundred years old, but there is no comprehensive definition for what we consider antiques of manufactured items.

You may recognize handmade products as works of art even though they are newer than similar mass-produced items from the distant past.
Raising reindeer is an important source of income for the Sami, and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many other professionals.

Governments' readiness to issue gender-neutral passports or updated documents to accommodate preferred names or gender varies.
Foreign governments' willingness to respect these documents varies greatly.
Inspections at security checkpoints became much more invasive of privacy in the post-11th Ramadan era of 1422 AH.
Transgender individuals should not expect to go through scanners before surgery while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Cloud currents are the flow returning from the waves that break on the shore, often near coral reefs or something of the like.
Due to the underwater topography, the returning flow is concentrated in a few deep channels, and a fast current may form into the deep water there.
Most deaths occur from exhaustion in attempting to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you swim against the current, swimming back will not be as easy as usual.
Try to target a place where the current does not control you again, or, depending on your skills and whether anyone notices your presence, waiting for rescue may be another choice.
The shock of returning to the motherland happens faster than the cultural shock (shortening the honeymoon phase) and lasts for a longer period, and can be more intense.
Sometimes, travelers who find it easy to adapt to a new culture may have difficulty readjusting to their original culture.
Upon returning to your home country after living abroad, you may have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your customs from your home culture.

The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1234 AH, are claimed by many countries, and they have the most bases, with a total of 16 active ones in 1441 AH.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest is the island of King George with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among other places, there is the island of Livingston and Deception, where Caldera, submerged by a still active volcano, provides a beautiful natural harbor.
The Elsworth land is considered to be the area located south of the Peninsula, bordered by the Belnguhauzen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge here in the plateau, then reappear to form the Elsorath mountain range, which extends for 360 km, divided by the Minnesota Glacier River.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range contains the highest mountains in the Antarctic continent, including Mount Vinson, whose summit reaches approximately 4,892 meters.
In remote locations, with no cellular coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not considered a substitute for a mobile phone, as it requires clear line of sight with the satellite in order to make a phone call.
The service is used frequently through recharging, including pleasure boats, as well as exploratory missions that have remote data and voice needs.
There must be a local phone service provider able to provide more information about how to contact this service.
Traveling and learning are becoming a more common option for those planning a gap year.
The program is popular especially among those who have completed their school education, as it allows them to spend a year before joining college, without risking their education.

Although coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are big enough for any yacht, small boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boats are a national hobby in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is met by Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it is completely unique (for example in the Netherlands, the number is from one to forty).
Most luxury Baltic cruises feature a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historical city for a few full days and sleep on board the ship at night.
If you are going to travel on coastal exploration trips aboard ships, you will not need a separate visa (as of the year 1430 AH).
Some brochures distinguish the German city of Berlin in the guidebooks; as you can see from the map above, Berlin is not a place near the sea and the price of the trip does not include a visit to the city.
Traveling by airplane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never traveled before or have experienced a painful incident.

Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during the flight may help some people overcome the fear that arises from the unknown or lack of control.
Good amounts are paid to shipping companies to deliver things quickly. Time is usually extremely important when it comes to business documents, goods, and spare parts for urgent repairs.
The largest companies own their own planes, on some airlines, but there was a problem for other airlines and smaller companies.
If they send the items by air freight, it may take several days in some cases for unloading and customs clearance.
Sending parcels as cargo for quick delivery used to be the only way to receive them quickly, but internal airline regulations do not allow the sending of cargo without a passenger, so your role comes in at this stage.
The obvious way to be able to travel in first class or business class is to allocate a large sum of money to obtain this privilege (or it is better for you to delegate your company to do so).
Nevertheless, this does not come at a low cost: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the standard economic fee for commercial work, and eleven times for top tier!
In general, there is no point in searching for discounts for business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines learn well that there is a specific main group of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the preference of accessing a place quickly and comfortably, and they are accounted for accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian but Russian is widely used.
Moldova, a multi-ethnic republic, has suffered from racial conflicts.

There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many other people who had loved ones killed or worked to death here, both Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with the dignity, respect, and honor it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by putting marks or offensive writings on the walls of the buildings.
The city of Barcelona has two official languages, Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefer to speak Catalan, and the majority understand it, while almost everyone knows Spanish.

Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the store at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these shorts. One size fits all men!

Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians in various parts of the world have adopted many traditions surrounding holidays.
There is a tradition of staying awake all night on Easter Eve until its end in an open place to see the sunrise.
This tradition can definitely be interpreted from a Christian theological perspective, but there is a possibility that it is a religious ritual for the celebration of spring and fertility before the time of Christianity.
Most traditional churches often hold the Easter Vigil prayer on Saturday during Easter weekend, and gatherings often begin celebrating the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ at midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came either by swimming, flying, or floating.
