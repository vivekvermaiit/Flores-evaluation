Science now indicates that the economy based on carbon is pushing human society away from a sustainable environment.
In society, each person participates and uses the transportation system. Most people criticize the transportation system.
In developed countries, concerns about water quality and bridge collapse are sometimes heard.
Why does the transportation system create such criticisms? Why do they become ineffective in your daily routine? Are the transportation authorities also incompetent? Does anything mostly stem from the root cause?
The practice of interaction between individual drivers and vehicles, as well as mutual communication, exists within the flow of traffic.
Due to misfortune, it is difficult to learn the traffic flow because it is not possible to describe the driver's behavior a hundred percent accurately.
Due to good fortune, the behavior of drivers always operates in a manner appropriate to the situation. Similarly, the behavior of traffic flows becomes somewhat unpredictable and difficult to control in a mathematical form.
The relationships should be presented in three important aspects to appoint the traffic flow with greater accuracy: (1) Flow (2) Density (3) Velocity
These relationships will be helpful in planning road construction, organizing events, and implementing projects.
