A small group of animals (small population) when separated from the main population they originated from (for example, when easily crossing a mountain ridge, or moving to a new island), most often face new challenges that they have not encountered before.
This new species has other resources and other competitors, so in order to be a smaller competitor because it needs even more attention to the new population, it may require humble features or adjustments.
The main population has not changed, they still need the same adjustments as before.
A new population, which has just started to adapt to the new environment, begins to resemble the other population less.

It is difficult for people living in the savanna to satisfy their needs with the available resources, as there are very few food-producing primates.
Apart from that, not adhering to this demand will lead to serious consequences, namely: imprisonment, loss of rights, and ultimately death.
It was easier for the ancestors to find food reserves that they could find in leaves and fruits, but for primates like us, it is difficult to accept them if they are not prepared.
On the contrary, food derived from fruits (plums, apricots, cherries), which are not easily digestible, also provide plenty of fibre and acidity which mostly ensures the large amount of intellect.
Taking into account what has been said, we should not be surprised by our ancestors' discussion of the 'white issue' as if we were observing chimpanzees in the savannah today.

We can also start living more friendly towards the environment around us, join the ecological movement and take actions to reduce future environmental disasters to some extent.
Treatment here is similar to symptomatic treatment. But if we don't just want temporary relief, then we need to find the cause of the problems and eliminate them.

During the Ice Age, regular rhythms of life were observed in various organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, in response to signals from the environment.
Biological clocks are oscillators that can continue their intrinsic oscillations even in the absence of external signals.
The genetic material of both Hershey and Chase was one of the main principles of the DNA.
Hershey and Chase used their own DNA to implant into bacteria or viruses.
They marked the DNE as radioactive or marked it with sulfur, and then they conducted two more tests.
The result could vary depending on the type of mutation, the possibility of the affected piece of genetic material and whether the affected individuals are carriers of the trait.
The mutations in the third chromosome can pass to the children, while mutations in other areas can lead to the loss or gain of chromosomes.
