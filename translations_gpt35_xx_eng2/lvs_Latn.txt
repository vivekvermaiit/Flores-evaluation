This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that was already widely spread, but also provides information that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the fur of this animal was chestnut brown on the upper side, but in the underside - in carotenoid colors.
This discovery also provides insight into the development of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur tail was not well developed in terms of feathers, called a stub, but has properties inherent in other feathers, namely, rays and barbs, researchers concluded that the stub likely appeared in a later stage of evolution than these properties.
The color pattern indicates that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers pointed out that, although this is a new dinosaur tail, the sample shows the plumage of an adult bird, not the down of a chick.

The bill requires that violent video games sold in the state of California be labeled with a "18" sticker, and their sale to minors would be punishable by a fine of $1000 for the violation.
Director of the State Prosecution Office Kƒ´rs Starmers (QC - Queen's Counsel) this morning made a statement informing about the initiation of proceedings against H≈´nes and Prais.
H≈´ne has stepped down, and in the office he will be replaced by deputy Eds Deivijs. It is expected that deputy Normens Lembs will receive the position of Minister of Economy, which was previously held by Deivijs.
H≈´nem and Praisam must arrive at the Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16th.
The injured were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Kudebaks. The driver was Kudebaks.
Edgars Vegilla suffered injuries to his hand and jaw, while Kristofer ≈†neider required facial reconstructive surgery.
The gun inaccurately shot when he was aiming at the head of the fifth man. Schneider has continuous pain, blindness in one eye, missing part of the skull, and a face reconstructed from titanium.
Schneider's provided testimony by using a video link from the USAF base in his homeland.
Karpanedo competed in two individual championship races without the Wednesday event.
In her first slalom race, she did not finish in the first run. 36 out of 116 competitors achieved the same result in this race.
In other competitions, namely in giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's downhill with a total time of 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first place winner, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth place winner, Giongi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers did not finish their runs, and 45 out of 117 skiers did not rank in the standings.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy inspector general D.K. Aria said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and also recovered her mobile phone and laptop".
The accused are being called Baba Kand≈æars, Bhuta Kand≈æars, Rampro Kand≈æars, Gaza Kand≈æars and Vi≈°nu Kand≈æars.
The police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused arrived at the court with covered faces.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the leader suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while the emergency services pulled the driver out of the red Audi TT.
At the beginning, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoja has been in custody at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of murdering his own son.
She is in custody, awaiting the submission of the indictment and trial, but the testimonies of the witnesses may be invalid, as her image has been widely publicized.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scotland's legal system operates differently, and courts have considered publishing a photo to be potentially prejudicial.
Dandy University professor Pamela Ferguson notes: "It seems that journalists are walking on thin ice by publishing photos of suspects and other information."
The prosecutor's office, responsible for prosecutions in general, has told journalists that no further comments will be given at least until the charges are brought.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants, based on the border situation before the 1967 Middle East war.
As reported, also such topics as Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, the future status, and the issue of the Jordan Valley, were discussed.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after signing the agreement, but the PA agrees to such presence only for five years.
The shooters who participated in the additional pest control trial had to be carefully guided by the foresters, as this trial was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
Qualified volunteers were recruited within the framework of the partnership between NPWS and the New South Wales Sporting Shooters Association (NSW) and the Hunting Program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) Park Conservation and Cultural Heritage Director Mika O'Flinn, comprehensive safety briefing and training were provided to the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation.
Martelli yesterday took the oath from the new Temporary Electoral Council (CEP), which consists of nine members.
It's Martel's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the president's commission suggested an earlier withdrawal of the CEP as part of a package of measures designed to bring the country closer to new elections.
The Commission's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October was to Martellƒ´.
Sometimes, violent protests were caused by the inability to hold elections, some since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPod malfunctions due to overheating have been registered, resulting in a total of six fires, in which four people suffered minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan reports that it is aware of 27 incidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that the company "Apple" has informed them about 34 additional overheating cases, which the company has referred to as "insignificant".
The Ministry responded, calling the postponement of the Apple announcement "truly regrettable."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 7:19 in the morning local time (Friday, 21:19 GMT).
The Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands announced that there have been no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there was no evidence of a tsunami.
The former Filipino police officer abducted Hong Kong tourists as hostages, robbing their bus in the Philippine capital Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been released so far, but at least six have been confirmed to have died.
Six hostages were quickly released, including children and elderly people, as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady because she needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Ligins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He studied to be a hairdresser and in 1959 started working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital.
When he worked at the hospital, Ligins began researching premature births in his spare time.
Her studies indicate that after hormone administration, it accelerates fetal lung maturation.
The agency "Xinhua" reported that on Wednesday, government investigators have recovered two "black boxes" - flight data recorders.
Other warriors who were her peers also showed respect to Luna.
Tomi Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna died on the night when there were two Moons visible. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dastin Rannels, known as "Goldust", commented, "Luna was just as strange as I am...maybe even stranger...I love her and will miss her...I hope she is in a better place now."
Out of the 1400 inhabitants who were surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the number of people who objected to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that, in her opinion, after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign, Australia should become a republic.
This opinion is held by 34% of the survey respondents who want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
The conflicting results of the survey indicate that 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist had to swim 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays in the Friendship Games, but his preparation is called into question due to his complaints.
He was not allowed to use medication to relieve the pain, because painkillers are prohibited in these games.
CentrƒÅlƒÅs Mis≈´ri UniversitƒÅtes matemƒÅtikas un datorzinƒÅt≈Üu profesors Kƒìrtiss K≈´pers discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Until the beginning of February, this discovery was verified by several people using different equipment and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets have brought water to Earth along with organic substances that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was created, as comet collisions with Earth occurred a long time ago.
53-year-old Cuomo began his tenure as governor at the beginning of this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
Assumptions are made that he will run for the 2016 presidential elections.
"NextGen" is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow an aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of older ground radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the location of pilots and provide pilots with more accurate information.
Additional transport vehicles are not planned to be added, surface trains will not stop at Wembley Stadium, but parking spaces and "park and ride" options will not be available at this location.
The fear of a transportation shortage increased the likelihood of having to play the game behind closed doors without the support of fans.
The study published in the journal "Science" reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that a new species has emerged within just two generations, although it was previously believed that such a process took much longer, taking into account the breeding between the endemic medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis) and the immigrant cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be poured into all kinds of shapes. It can even be rolled into very fine shapes.
It can be stretched like a small rope that can be bent and twisted. It can be carved or formed into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metal. It can be so thin that sometimes it was used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can create an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical substance is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the letter H in the pH combination) in the tested chemical substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons with electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together and then press them into a ball with clean, moist hands.
The moisture of the hands will react with the external layers, creating a strange sensation and forming a kind of coating.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a water closet toilet that was connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
The sewage systems waste has been found in the cities of Minoan (Crete) and the houses of Santorini (Greece).
Toilets were also present in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women went together in mixed company.
When calling someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and then almost immediately reflects it back.
A rocket sent satellites into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a huge rocket is needed, with a height exceeding 100 feet.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the bicycle has done for us is to provide much easier and faster transportation.
He has provided us with trains, cars, and many other vehicles.
After that, there are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, including rabbits, antelopes, and gazelles.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat a variety of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept - a specific task that each cat performs and that does not allow it to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called prides.
Only one to three closely related adult males and up to thirty females and offspring form a herd.
Mothers-in-law are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of mothers and daughters.
A pack of lions acts similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs - the behavior of these two animals is surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not other big cats) - and is just as deadly to their prey.
The athletic tiger is able to climb (although not very well), swim, make long leaps, and pull with five times greater strength than a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not similar to the full-throated roar of a lion, but rather like a growling, guttural word.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If possible, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that lynxes track and locate their prey by scent, following the scent left on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision ability and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey, blending in with their surroundings, and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population, from which they have come (for example, if they move across a mountain ridge or river or migrate to a new island, so they cannot easily move back), they often end up in a different environment, rather than the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and various competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations in order to be stronger competitors than they needed to be before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as new residents begin to adapt to their new environment, they become less and less similar to the rest of the residents.
In the end, after thousands or millions of years, both populations will look so different that they cannot be called one species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important element of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe, but they also absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants obtain their nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the biggest predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
In the long jaws there were more than 70 very sharp teeth, supplemented by additional teeth in the mouth cavity, and therefore no one who ended up in its path had a chance to escape.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that it had a forked tongue. It ate armored insects, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that entered the water; even such a huge dinosaur as T. rex would not have been able to deal with it.
Although most Roman dishes would be familiar to us, they also had some strange and unusual festival foods, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and rodents called dormice.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate while sitting in chairs, while the rich men liked to have joint banquets where they would lie on their sides while eating.
In ancient Roman dishes, products imported from America or Asia were definitely not used in Europe until later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman has ever tasted turkey meat.
The Babylonians each built the main temple for their own god, which was considered the god's dwelling place.
People brought offerings to the gods, but priests tried to fulfill the needs of the gods by performing ceremonies and festivals.
In every temple, there was an open temple courtyard and further inside, the inner sanctuary where only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes as part of the temple, specially pyramidal towers called ziggurats were built.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Close to the warm climate of the East, the house was not so important.
The Jewish family mostly lived outdoors.
Women cooked food in the courtyard; stores were simple open stalls facing the street. Houses were built of stone.
In the land of Canaan, there were not many large forests, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The ancient Scandinavian sagas tell of Erik the Red being exiled from Iceland for murder and, heading further west, discovered a land which he named Greenland.
However, despite his discovery, at that moment the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each was a "Nordic" country, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have watched the movie "National Treasures", you can believe that the treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The following words are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence: "The original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although nobody knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that this large parchment document (29¬æ x 24¬Ω inches) was shortly rolled up and stored after its creation.
The note is most likely added simply as a label.
The breakout on D-Day and subsequent fighting had liberated the north of France, but the south still remained occupied.
They were the inhabitants of France who, in 1940, made peace with the Germans and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France; this invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a special culture created by an extremely large group of people who live and work, collaborating with each other, namely, society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis", which means civil, related to the Latin "civis", which means citizen, and "civitas", which means city or city-state, and it also somehow defines the size of society.
City-states are the ancestors of nations. The culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge to multiple generations, persistent cultural influence and its uniform spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind significant historical evidence, and they are not recognized as fully-fledged civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states, based on the Articles of Confederation, for the first time established a weak central government, whose only component was Congress.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and, as there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state institutions, which often did not want to cooperate, hoping that they would implement all the laws it adopted.
It also did not have the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between countries.
In order for the laws to be amended, unanimous consent of all states was necessary, but the states were so frivolous in their attitude towards the central government that their representatives often did not show up.
The Italian national football team, as well as the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, having also won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, shooting, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in both international and Olympic games.
Japan consists of almost 7000 islands (the largest of them is Honshu), ranking Japan as the 7th largest island in the world.
Thanks to the fact that Japan's territory includes several islands, from a geographical point of view it is often referred to as an "archipelago."
The beginning of Taiwan was in the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the name of the island as "Ilha Formosa" or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating the transformation of local farming practices and employing Chinese laborers in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and announced its inclusion as a province in the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereign power over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, namely, Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings constructed on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to provide tourists with a better understanding of how they originally originated.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common non-moving image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the most common film size during the era of analog film photography.
It is still being produced, but more importantly, its image proportions are now used in digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format is actually slightly confusing, as it is 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many widely accepted formats (such as the APS format group) either correspond to these image edge ratios or are very similar to them.
The much distorted and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining the order of the image.
The indication here is that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and influential, came under scrutiny.
More than a thousand years, the Christian religion has united European countries, despite the different languages and traditions.
This comprehensive power affected everyone, from the king to the ordinary citizens.
One of the main Christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and reduce poverty, and the church's financial resources are specifically intended for this purpose.
The central power of the Church in Rome has existed for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle is being upheld.
Shortly after the outbreak of the war, Britain initiated a blockade of the German fleet.
The strategy proved effective in interrupting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international legal norms codified in several international treaties of the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering the entire part of the ocean which even endangered neutral ships.
Therefore, as a reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the majority of residents and nations considered pacifism and isolation to be the most important.
After the horrors and atrocities experienced in the first World War, countries wanted to avoid a repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to start working for Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his previous employer), addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of depicting different time periods; each stage of Chinese development or each family in power was a different dynasty.
In addition, there was a period of unstable divided provinces between each dynasty. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there was a ruthless battle for the throne among many noble ones.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest times in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people perishing in the struggle for control of the most important location in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
In addition, after the Revolution, all male gender applicants could apply for positions, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same applies to the military field, as now army ranks are assigned based on individual characteristics rather than belonging to a certain class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other suppressed classes of workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in transcendent questions. He often went to the cave that became known as Hira cave on Mount Noor (light) to engage in contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the turning of the ages, vividly demonstrates Muhammad's inclination towards spirituality.
The cave is located on one of the mountain peaks to the north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find at all, even if someone knew it existed. Entering the cave, complete isolation sets in.
Nothing more than clear, beautiful skies above and many mountains all around is visible. From inside the cave, you can't see or hear much from the outside world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BCE, is one of the many massive pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, also known as the "Giza Necropolis," consists of several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Cheops' wives and family members.
The upward curve sign looks like a V and the "downward curve" looks like a arch or square missing the bottom edge.
Up means you need to start from the throttle and squeeze the lever, down means you should start from the grip (where your hand holds the handle) and pull the lever.
The upward movement of the coil usually produces a softer sound, while the downward movement is stronger and more convincing.
You can mark your notes, but remember that the printed notes are indicated for the purpose of musical sound, so they should generally be followed.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister Madame Elizabeth were forced to return to Paris on October 6, 1789, due to the crowd of market women at Versailles.
In the midst of the crowd, they returned to Paris, threatening the king and queen.
The crowd compelled the king and queen to open the palace gates widely.
At one point, a member of the band waved the head of the terrified queen's slain royal guard in front of Versailles.
The expenses of the American imperialist war in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime in the US to cover the majority of expenses, and the interest on bonds in the name of the Filipino government flowed through the Wall Street bank houses.
Of course, the superprofits obtained from the long exploitation of the Filipino people formed the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the environment that led to the creation of the order.
The period during which the events took place is usually referred to as the Middle Ages - the European historical period of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
Before the High Middle Ages, there were the Early Middle Ages, and after the High Middle Ages, the Late Middle Ages followed, which ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice covers a wide range of ideas, starting from the direction of technology or technological imperative to a strict understanding that human destiny is driven by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
The majority of interpretations of technological determinism are divided into two main ideas: technological development largely occurs outside of cultural or political influence and technologies themselves create "impact" on societies, and this impact is derived, not socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the car definitely contributes to road development.
However, the state road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the costs associated with car use.
A large number of private cars also means a higher number of accidents, resulting in the invention of new methods to repair bodily injuries in healthcare.
Romanticism was largely characterized by cultural determinism, which stemmed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography influenced people, and over time, a culture and customs associated with the respective geographic region emerged, which were better than arbitrarily imposed laws, as they were in harmony with the society's place.
Similarly to how Paris is considered the world's fashion capital today, Constantinople was also considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known as a center for luxury goods, starting around the 4th century of our era and ending around the 11th century.
Its status became less significant in the 12th century, as the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued higher than those available in Byzantine markets.
At that time, Constantinople lost the title of the fashion capital, while Paris gained it.
The Gothic style gained popularity in the 10th-11th century and later in the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was largely influenced by the culture of the Byzantine people living in the East.
However, due to the slow communication channel, fashion in the West may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest achievements of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to fasten clothing.
Self-sufficient farming is farming that is carried out to grow enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his or her family.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple, often organic system in which seeds collected in the eco-region are used together with relatively simple methods to maximize yield.
Historically, the majority of peasants were engaged in subsistence agriculture, as still happens in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel neglected by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can vary in terms of participants' age, ethnic background, class, location, and/or gender.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be a combination of linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or other factors.
Representatives of subcultures often emphasize their belonging by using different and symbolic styles, including fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is examples of unsuccessful cases where parents did not provide socialization during their children's upbringing due to neglect, difficulties, or deliberate abuse.
Children like this are called "wild" or feral. Some wild children have been restricted by humans (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child occurred because the parents rejected the child's severe intellectual or physical impairments.
Feral children may have experienced serious violence or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals; some claim to have lived in the wild alone.
Growing up completely with animals, a wild child exhibits almost the same behavior (with physical limitations) as the respective animal that takes care of them, for example, fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning should make the training process easier and more interesting, but using a basis is a step forward.
The approach of scaffolding is not a method of teaching, but rather a means of support for people who are learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can happen both virtually and in reality, in other words, a support can be a teacher, but equally well also the little paperclip in the Microsoft Office program.
Virtual whiteboards are embedded in the software, and they are designed to ask, present and explain procedures that students might find difficult to solve on their own.
Children are placed in foster families for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving, and educational, yet it happens.
We believe that the foster family system is a safety net for these children.
Our system, which provides for the upbringing of foreign children in families, must provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster families must provide everything necessary that was missing from the homes from which they were previously removed.
The internet combines both mass and interpersonal communication elements.
The different features of the Internet create additional dimensions in terms of usage and satisfaction approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are identified as important motivating factors for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Studying the target audience's reaction to websites, Imijs and McCords (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivating aspects.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro expressions - facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
Especially it is claimed that a person can determine whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting facial microexpressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Olivers Sakss showed how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately determine its truthfulness.
He even suggests the assumption that such abilities to interpret human behavior can also be present in animals, for example, pet dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two sets of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, but natural selection removes it from the overall variation.
Segregation and recombination in each generation shifts variations back and forth between these two sets.
Primates with a digestive system like humans find it difficult to obtain the necessary amino acids with the available plant resources in the savanna.
Furthermore, this can have serious consequences: delayed growth, inadequate nutrition, and even death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins available in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, it is difficult to digest them unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal origin food (crickets, termites, bees) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a lot of protein, containing essential amino acids.
Taking all this into account, it would not be surprising if our ancestors also solved their "protein problem" similarly to how savanna-dwelling chimpanzees are currently doing.
Interrupted sleep is a process during normal sleep when purposeful awakening occurs, followed by falling back asleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up, but without fully waking you.
If you change the alarm in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorythm-based option is to drink plenty of fluids before going to bed (especially water or tea, which are known for their diuretic effect) to make yourself get up and go to the bathroom.
The amount of inner peace in a person is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in a person's body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders achieving this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but expanded it with the path of Mahayana love and many methods of Indian yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path to universal love.
During the practice of Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini (clarity) energy is awakened using yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan meditation center is the Yoga of Divinity. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and a consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. When the war ended, due to different systems, processes, and cultures, these countries became enemies again.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was destined to last for the next 40 years and, using proxy armies, real military action was carried out in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenders had already been defeated, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans morally aged almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army arrived and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international bilateral and multilateral agreements.
The use of ships for transporting goods is still the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional task of the naval fleet has been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while also disrupting the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the 2nd World War North Atlantic campaign. Americans tried to transport troops and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, mainly using submarines, tried to block this traffic.
If the allies had not succeeded, Germany would most likely have conquered Great Britain as well as all the other European countries.
Goats were likely first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
The ancient people and tribes began to cultivate them because they could easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Home goats usually grazed in herds, which wandered around the meadows and other grazing areas and were supervised by goat herders, who were often children or adults, similar to the more widely known sheep herders. These grazing methods are still used to this day.
Wagons were built in England already in the 16th century.
Although the horse-drawn railway consisted only of parallel wooden beams, they allowed the draft horses to reach greater speeds and pull larger loads than on the bumpy roads of the time.
In the very beginning, wooden slats were used to prevent the sledges from moving. However, it was gradually understood that the sledges would be even more effective if they had a metal strip on top.
It became a common practice, but the iron caused a greater wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In the end, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron-made tracks were introduced.
The first known form of movement was walking, people began walking upright two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright human).
Their ancestors of australopithecus did not walk upright as usual.
Double-curved individuals were already found in the skull fossils of australopithecines, who lived 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although representatives of the Sahelanthropus genus may have been walking on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, can join the environmental movement and even be activists to some extent reduce suffering in the future.
In many cases, it is just like symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we should find the roots of the problem and deactivate them.
It is clear that the world has significantly changed due to the scientific and technological achievements of humanity, and the problems have become more serious due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, the hand-signed draft of the document by Congress president John Hancock and secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house, located a few blocks away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides" (Declaration of Independence).
John Nixon conducted the first public reading of the document in the courtyard of Independence Castle on July 8th.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and on July 9, he read it to his army in New York. One copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 "Dunlap broadsides", for which it is known that they still exist, are the oldest surviving document copies. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Nowadays, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many people do not perceive them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, birds still have many features that resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a tyrannosaurus.
Almost all computers used today are based on manipulation of information, which is encoded in binary number form.
The binary number can only have two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or in computer language - bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately noticeable. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough to not immediately establish a diagnosis.
The most specific sign of internal poisoning can be the presence of open medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Read the first aid instructions for the specific poison on the label.
The term "vabole" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term has originated from ancient association with bed bugs, which have adapted very well to parasitizing on humans.
Both fleas and bedbugs are parasitic insects that have adapted to living in nests or feeding on other bodies.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 registered cases of multiple sclerosis, making it the most common neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged people.
We have a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
In studies, it was found that women have twice the chance of developing MS than men.
A couple can decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or the interest of their child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents' rights are terminated so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works using the scientific method. In fact, this method is the driving force behind most scientific research.
There is also experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and observations can also drive scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinion was recognized in all scientific fields, including in questions of psychology.
As fewer and fewer people knew the Greek language, Western countries were separated from their Greek philosophy and scientific roots.
The presence and formation of endogenous cycles, taking into account the biological clock, often have a decisive influence on many observed rhythms in psychology and behavior.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply a response to external periodic signals, have been confirmed for the majority of living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to function freely even without external triggers.
Hersey and Chase's experiment was one of the leading proposals that DNA is genetic material.
Her≈°ijs and ƒåeiss used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant the bacteria with their DNA.
They conducted two experiments, marking either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material units, and whether the affected cells are stem cell line cells.
Children can only inherit mutations in germ line cells, but mutations in other cells can cause cell damage or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
In these places, you can engage in activities such as hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, or visit parks and research information about the ecosystem.
A visit to Borneo Island can be cited as an example to take photos and get to know the orangutans.
Every morning people from small rural towns drive to their workplaces in cars, while others arrive to take their place, whose workplace is located in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is somehow connected and supports the transportation system based on private cars.
Now scientists point out that an economy with such extensive carbon emissions has disrupted one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is a part of society and participates in transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear about similar complaints about water quality or crumbling bridges.
Why do such complaints arise about transport systems, why do problems arise in them every day? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or is the root of the problem deeper?
The traffic flow is a study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their possible interactions.
Unfortunately, researching traffic flow is difficult because it is impossible to predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers is often quite consistent, so a certain consistency can be determined for traffic flows and they can be approximately calculated mathematically.
To better reflect traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and processes for race track infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily, as well as to find food and mates more effectively.
The majority of insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over their bodies, attaching them to the body along their entire length.
It gives them a wider range of small spaces to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Several thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some thought that he was right, but many had opposite thoughts: that the Solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That seems reasonable, because there is no sensation that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It contains more than 8 times the amount of water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, in some places six miles wide.
20% of the water volume that flows into the oceans from all the world's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids from stones continued until the end of the Old Kingdom's existence, the pyramids of Giza remained unsurpassed in size and excellent technical performance.
The ancient Egyptians marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old at the time.
The population of the Vatican is around 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world with the lowest population.
The Vatican uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communication.
The Italian language is also a daily language used by the majority of working people in this country, but Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican residents are Roman Catholics.
People have known chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as they are all found in nature in free form and are relatively easy to excavate with primitive tools.
Philosopher Aristotle expressed the theory that everything consists of a combination of one or more specific elements. These elements were earth, water, air, and fire.
It reminded more of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also expressed the theory that they change into new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many chemical elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys in which a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon, is present.
Overall everything consists of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that a single period at the end of this sentence would consist of trillions of atoms.
: Therefore, when the pencil was invented, it was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the status of the pencil decreased, and it began to be used less frequently.
Now people write messages on the computer screen, and there is no need for a typewriter at all.
We can only imagine how the keyboard will change when a new invention appears.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
In a way, like rolling heavy wheels in the mountain. Again splitting the core, part of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they have a tendency to split with a slight stimulus or just spontaneously.
The moon's surface is formed by rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The bark is approximately 70 km thick on the nearest side, but 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner beneath the basalt plain and thicker beneath the highlands.
In the nearest side there could be more Mare Crisium, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for Lavai to rise to the surface.
At the core of content theories is the attempt to clarify what inspires people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that, upon reaching adulthood, are internalized.
This theory examines what makes certain people want to do things they do, and what things within them will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Usually, for managers who start leading their former colleagues, two types of behavior can appear. At one end of the spectrum, there are efforts to maintain the "insider" status.
Managers of this type have difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the scale, the leader becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that everything the team has done so far needs to be changed and turned into their own achievement.
In the end, the leader is fully responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This kind of behavior often causes disputes between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are some minor differences.
Virtual team members often act as a communication point for their direct physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than regular team members, as their teams can meet according to different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of true "invisible teams" (page 109, Larson and LaFasto book, published in 1989) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
"The invisible team" is a management team to which each participant reports. The invisible team sets standards for each participant.
Why would an organization want to invest time in such a time-consuming process of creating a learning organization? One of the goals for introducing the concept of a learning organization in practice is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively utilized in the organization's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can be unleashed.
As a result, the process in which the organization works together to overcome the obstacle can promote the creation of a new, innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before the organization focuses on innovation, leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as an organization that shares knowledge and supports continuous learning.
Angels (2006) explains the approach of continuity as a method used to help organizations achieve higher-level results.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to understanding ability research. Therefore, it narrows the research field and makes it more precise.
Scientists are supported in their research by the correlation between brain pathology and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
The growth of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen brain structures and processes.
It provides us with a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes happening in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence is largely associated with science fiction, it is an extremely important direction in computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of technology.
In research, tasks are automated for machines that require programmable actions to perform.
As an example, control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer questions and make diagnoses, as well as recognize handwriting, voice and face, can be mentioned.
Such things have become separate industries focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, as well as being integrated into several home computer and video game software applications.
The study field trip is a big part of the learning process. Often the teacher is willing to take the students to places where they can't reach by bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual educational excursions. Students, sitting with their classmates, can view museum artifacts, visit the aquarium, or admire beautiful art.
Sharing virtual educational field trip experiences is a great way to discuss the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students of Beneta School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital and every year this website is updated, but previous versions are saved online as a historical album.
Diaries can also help improve students' writing skills. Although often at the beginning, when students start writing a diary, they do not pay attention to grammar and correctness, the presence of readers usually changes that.
As students are often the most critical target audience, the author of the blog begins to strive to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
In addition, writing a blog "encourages students to explore the world around them more broadly." The need to maintain reader interest motivates students to be curious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing in journals is a method that promotes collaboration and encourages students to learn outside of school hours.
The appropriate use of blogs "can stimulate students to become more analytical and think critically. Actively using the materials available on the internet, students can define their own position in the context of other written content, as well as express their view on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital with numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further to the south is the Niagara Falls, while in the northern part one can enjoy the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and much more.
All of that and much more forgives Ontario for what others consider the true Canada.
Wide territories further to the north are quite sparsely populated, and in some places are practically uninhabited wild areas.
In comparison of population numbers, which surprises many: the number of African Americans living in the USA is much larger than the population of Canada.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is undoubtedly the largest, and, when it comes to wild animals, it is like a separate continent.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent countries or are associated with France, as well as known as luxury class beach resorts.
Arabs also introduced Islam in their lands - in the Comoros Islands and Mayotte it happened on a large scale.
The influence of Europeans and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the route from Europe to India around the Cape of Good Hope.
In the north, this region borders with the Sahel region, but in the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: all traveling women are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to pull out the ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that due to cultural differences, situations may arise that they may perceive as pushiness, and it is not unusual for a woman to be followed, have her hand grabbed, etc.
Do not be afraid to reject men and deflect their attention (whether it's cultural differences or not, it is still not acceptable).
In the 10th century BC, the modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen, and was utilized as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casablanca so that it would be abandoned after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city into Daru l-Badija, and Spanish merchants who established trading bases there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting shopping places in all of Morocco.
In the old town of Medina, it is easy to find places where Moroccan traditional products such as tagines, ceramic dishes, leather products, water pipes and all sorts of trinkets are sold, but all of this is only intended for tourists.
Goma is a popular city for tourists in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located right on the eastern border with Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city streets, especially in its center.
Although Goma is sufficiently safe, all visits outside of Goma should be reviewed to understand the current situation of fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a starting point to climb the Nyiragongo volcano along with a few of the cheapest gorilla tracking spots in Africa.
To move around Goma, you can use a "boda-boda" (motorcycle taxi). The typical (local) price for a short ride is around 500 Congolese francs.
Due to the difficulty in accessing it, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor used to refer to exotic, distant lands.
Nowadays Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the list of endangered world heritage sites due to desert sand endangerment.
This was one of the main stops where the PBS documentary "Wonders of the African World" hosted by Henry Louis Gates was filmed.
The city stands out from the rest of the country's cities because it has more Arab, rather than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the eastern border of Mozambique, to the north of Zimbabwe, with the southern border being the Crocodile River.
The area of the park is 19,500 km¬≤, and it is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports various wild animals.
This is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the most significant of the South African national parks (SANParks).
Similar to all national parks in South Africa, this park also has daily maintenance and entrance fees.
It might be beneficial to also purchase a "Wild Card" which provides access to certain South African parks or all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong and it is a place that many tourists consider to be the main one.
The overall silhouette of the buildings, which forms the panorama of Hong Kong, is likened to a shimmering strip diagram, clearly demonstrated by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, go to the opposite shore of Kowloon from the island.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed along the northern coast on reclaimed land.
This is a place that the British colonizers took over as their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast inland of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining grand jungle growths that once covered the Gandzhetika plain.
The Sundarbans area is 3850 km¬≤, of which approximately one third is covered by water/marshland territories.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in its territory.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most, especially on the eastern and D≈æakƒÅras/Bumtangas routes, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often overcrowded, it is advisable to purchase a ticket several days in advance.
Most of the districts are serviced by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxi services offer a quick and convenient way to reach nearby places, such as Paro (150 Bhutanese ngultrums) and Punakha (200 Bhutanese ngultrums).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge. It stretches over the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Both towers rise to a height of 83 meters, their length is 378 meters, and they have two 3.50 meter wide strips.
The vertical distance below the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully ready for operation in September 2017, when the completion of the Brazilian customs control points is scheduled.
The Guarani were the most significant group of indigenous people who inhabited the present-day eastern part of Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers, who also engaged in natural agriculture.
In the ƒåako region, other foreign tribal groups also lived, such as guaikuru and pajaga, who subsisted on hunting, foraging, and fishing.
Paraguay, once known as "The Great Indian Province", was formed as a result of the interaction between 16th century Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its foundation in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its local character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Kanjitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and matches also take place here several other times a year.
Look for information about tournaments and places where you can buy tickets for polo games on the website of the "Asociacion Argentina de Polo" association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the value of which is pegged to the value of one pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stenley opposite the "FIC West Store".
Usually, in most places they accept British pounds, while in Stanley they also often accept credit cards and US dollars.
In remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and US currency may be accepted; ask the owners beforehand to find out the accepted payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Faroe Islands outside the island territory, so exchange money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer there is when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, the temperature usually exceeds +30 ¬∞C.
Winter can be deceptively wet: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but if there is wind and moisture at the same time, it seems colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many park animals are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the guidelines of the park surveillance institutions, a distance of at least 100 yards/meters must be maintained from bears and wolves, as well as a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how submissive they may seem, bison, moose, North American elk, bears and practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they do not maintain a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and can also be dangerous, so it's better to keep your distance from them.
Remember that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid transporting or cooking aromatic foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu, and its population is just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the sadly famous location of a maritime standstill in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships sank, except for the British cruise ship. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
In the fight for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city center turned into the assassination of the high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Thanks to Auckland's two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the northern coast (in the northern province of HƒÅrboras) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of them are sandy beaches, where it is safe to swim, and most of the shade is provided by palm trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Viaduct Harbour, Mission Bay, and St Heliers exclusive suburbs in Central Auckland.
Those are sometimes overcrowded family beaches with a good range of shops located on the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Numur viens', it is not a strong flavored beer, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines are more popular.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you are cautious, bottled water is easy to find.
The concept of 'coffee with milk' is foreign to Australians. Black coffee is called 'espresso', cappuccino is made with a huge pile of froth (not milk foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Trips to the reef are organized year-round, but injuries in the reef are rare due to the mentioned reasons.
However, listen to the recommendations of the institutions, take note of all signs, and carefully observe safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear at beaches and riverbanks from October to April in the northern part of the city in 1770. Sometimes they are also found at other times.
Sharks are encountered, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and usually swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not commonly found ocean inhabitants; their main habitat is in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Previous reservation gives travelers peace of mind that when they arrive at their destination, they will have a place to sleep.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although with the assistance of a travel agent, you have the opportunity to book different types of accommodation, such as camping spots.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation services to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold a reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
However, any changes or requests must first be sent to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the majority of attendees choose to live in tents, and most of them consider it an essential part of the festival experience.
If you want to be close to the epicenter of the event, you need to arrive early to find a camping spot that is close to the music.
Don't forget: even if the music has already stopped playing on the main stages, there may be places at the festival where the music continues to play until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas designed for families with small children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic in winter, check the location of the huts, as crossing the ice makes quite a terrible noise for those most affected by this activity.
Cruise ships in St. Petersburg allow for the city sightseeing. Cruise ship passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the rules).
Casinos usually do everything possible to keep their visitors as long as possible and to make them spend more money. Usually there are no windows and clocks in the casino rooms, and sometimes it is difficult to find the exit.
They usually have special dishes, drinks, and entertainment offerings to keep guests in a good mood and keep them in the premises.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are offered on the institution's bill. However, alcohol consumption weakens judgment, and every good player knows how important it is to keep a clear mind.
Anyone planning to drive a vehicle in polar regions or over mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
The icy and snowy roads have low traction, so you cannot drive the same way as on clean asphalt.
During snowstorms, in a very short time, so much snow can fall that it can cause traffic jams.
Visibility can also be limited by falling snow, fog, condensation, or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions in many countries are normal, so traffic flows mostly without interruption all year round.
Safari trips are possibly the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable experience for many visitors.
