This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a known theory, but also allows for details that fossils typically cannot provide, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangements.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut-brown on the top, with a pale or yellow-orange-red underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed central shaft, called the rachis, but have other feather characteristics - quills and tiny quill-like structures - researchers concluded that the rachis is likely a later evolutionary development compared to other feather characteristics.
The structure of these feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for temperature regulation or appearance. Researchers note that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of an adult, not a young individual.
Research has shown that, even though this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult feathers, not chick feathers.

The job completed was mostly theoretical in nature, but the program was written to mimic observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth and causes tides in that way, so does the Milky Way exert force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, the majority of dark matter is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and consists of many small particles.

Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Besides the event held on Wednesday, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the championships.
Her first race was a slalom, where she received a "Did Not Finish" in the first race. The same result was had by 36 out of 116 competitors in that race.
In her second race, in the giant slalom, she took tenth place in the women's group with a combined race time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani who finished in ninth place.
Four female skiers in the women's Paralympic category failed to finish the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to finish the race.
The police from the Madhya Pradesh region found and returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya stated: "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and we have also found and returned her mobile phone and laptop to her".
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.

He was first placed in the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in front of the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh since then, charged with the murder of her son.
She is in custody while waiting for charges to be filed and trial, but any witness evidence may be dismissed because her picture has been published many times.
This is a regular practice in other parts of Great Britain, but the Scottish justice system operates differently and the courts considered it possible that the publication of the photographs could be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee points out that "it seems that journalists are really walking a thin line when publishing photos of suspects."
The public prosecutor's office, which is fully responsible for criminal prosecution, has indicated to the journalists that there will be no further comments, at least until the indictment is filed.
The document, according to leaked information, will be related to the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to base on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
The remaining topics supposedly include the future state of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations and is a problem in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands permanent military presence in this valley for a period of ten years after the agreement is signed, while the PA accepts military presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary trial program for pest control were supposed to be under the vigilant supervision of the rangers, as the trial program was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers have been recruited in accordance with the shooting sports association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and heritage at the park within NPWS, four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received detailed safety instructions and training.
Yesterday, nine members of the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) took the oath before Martelly.
That is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission proposed that the previous CEO resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
At times violent protests have been sparked due to the failure to hold elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.
Around 60 cases of iPod overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns in four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it had information on 27 accidents related to those devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple informed them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company says is "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in reporting "truly unfortunate".
An earthquake hit Marijana at 07:19 in the morning local time (Friday at 09:19 PM GMT).
The Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands has announced that there have been no reported damages in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there are no indications of a tsunami.
The former police officer from the Philippines held tourists from Hong Kong hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued so far, and at least six have been confirmed dead.
Earlier, six hostages were released, including children, elderly people, and photographers from the Philippines.
The photographers later took the place of the older lady when she needed the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins began a medical career.
He trained as a midwife and started working at the State Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at Liggins Hospital, he researched premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that administering hormones will speed up the maturation of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua agency announced that government investigators found two "black boxes" for recording data during the flight on Wednesday.
Colleagues wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated that "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away at the age of two months. Pretty unique, just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was strange like me...maybe even more...I love her and I will miss her...I hope she is in a better place."
Out of 1,400 people who were surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the federal election campaign in 2010, the Prime Minister of the transitional government, Julia Gillard, claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
This opinion is shared by 34 percent of the surveyed people who wish for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch in Australia.
The survey showed two types of extreme views: 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle events, as well as in three phases at the Commonwealth Games, but there are doubts about his fitness due to complaints.
He couldn't take the necessary pain-relieving medication because those medications are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Several people confirmed this discovery using various hardware and software by the beginning of February, which was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water delivery to Earth along with organic matter that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, because comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, aged 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to rumors as political gossip and nonsense".
It is rumored that he will run for president in 2016.
The FAA asserts that NextGen system, which would enable airplanes to fly shorter routes and thus save millions of gallons of fuel annually while also reducing carbon emissions.
Use satellite-based technology instead of outdated ground radar technology so that air traffic controllers can more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
Additional transport will not be available and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and bus interchange car parks are not available near the stadium.
Fear of transportation shortage has increased the likelihood of the game having to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
The study published on Thursday in the journal Science made claims about the formation of a new species of birds on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have announced that a new species has developed in just two generations, although it was believed that this process took much longer, due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza forte, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into various shapes. It can be twisted into small forms.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
The pH value of a chemical substance is called that. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemicals are.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
The ions of hydrogen are protons from which electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders, and then use clean wet hands to form a ball from them.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and creating a kind of protection.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet that was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of a sewage system were found in the houses of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women socialized together.
When calling someone who is miles away, use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call, and then reflects it back down almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and view.
For placing satellites or telescopes in space, a giant rocket over 100 feet high is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing that the wheel has provided us with is much easier and faster transportation.
He brought us a train, car, and many other transportation devices.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
In the end, there are many small cats (including lost pet cats) that eat a variety of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special skill possessed by every cat and why they do not compete with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats and live in large groups called prides.
The pack consists of one to three adult males who are related, as well as up to thirty females and offspring.
Women are usually closely connected to each other because it is a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that behave surprisingly like lions (but not other big cats) and are also very deadly to their prey.
Tiger, like a true multi-sport athlete, can climb (although not well), swim, leap long distances, and exert five times the strength of a powerful man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four cats that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a sentence angrily shouted out.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all of the animals that ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find the animals they prey on based on smell by sniffing the ground where those animals have been located.
They have very good night vision and move very quietly. Ocelots hunt prey by blending in with their surroundings, and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population they originate from (for example, when crossing a mountain range or river or when they move to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment that is different from the environment they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population, in order to be a strong competitor, will need different characteristics or adaptation compared to what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, two populations will differ so much that they will not be able to be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants create oxygen that people breathe in, and they take in carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants produce food through photosynthesis using the sun. They also provide shade.
We build houses and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was a top predator of its time. It was afraid of nothing, except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws contained more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional row on the roof of his mouth, meaning there was no escape for any creature that crossed his path.
We are not sure, but maybe she had a forked tongue. Her diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe even cannibalism.
He would attack anything that entered the water. Not even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could measure up to him.
While most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans also ate some strange or unusual foods at feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse
The other difference was that while the poor men and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to host banquets where they would lounge on their sides while eating.
The ancient Roman meals could not include food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their deities which was considered the home of that deity.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could access.
Sometimes special towers in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower represented a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
Women were cooking in the courtyard; shops represented only open cash registers facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was incredibly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Norwegian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and gave it that name.
However, regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there during that period.
Although each country was considered "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that there is a map to the treasure written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not correct. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text is printed upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that this great document on parchment (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was originally rolled up and stored in the archive.
Therefore, it is possible that the note was simply added as a tag.
The landing in Normandy (D-Day) and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
In the northern part of France, the "Vichy regime" was in power. These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting against them.
The Allies attacked southern France on August 15, 1944, and the attack was named "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil and refers to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state and in a way defines the size of society.
Cities-states are the precursor of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge through several generations, a long-lasting cultural trace, and fair spreading.
Lesser cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and without being recognized as true civilizations.
According to the Confederation Agreement, during the War for Independence, thirteen federal states first formed a weak central government, whose only component was the Congress.
The Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive authority or judiciary, the implementation of acts relied on state agencies that often did not cooperate.
Also, he did not have the authority to cancel tax laws and tariffs between states.
Members sought full consent of all states before any changes could be made, but the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful national team in the world and they were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective.
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base on the southwest coast of Taiwan in 1624, initiated a change in the aboriginal practice of grain production, and hired Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
The forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, according to which sovereignty over Taiwan was ceded to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
At Machu Picchu, there are three main buildings - Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been renovated to give tourists a better insight into how they originally looked.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored by 1976, and the restoration has continued up to the present day.
For example, the most common format for static images in the world is 35 mm, which dominated at the end of the analog film period.
Today it is still being produced, but more importantly, the display format has been adopted in the format of digital camera image sensors.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing - 36mm in width with 24mm in height.
Therefore, for the proportion ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of the total number), it is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) are equal to or approximate to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often misused and mocked, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in the picture.
It is stated that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, found itself under control.
The Christian religion has connected European countries for over a thousand years despite different languages and customs.
Her dominant strength influenced everyone - from kings to ordinary people.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds serve that purpose.
The central organ of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and because of this concentration of power and money, many wonder whether this rule is being respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of the conflict, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective in disrupting the delivery of vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated the internationally accepted law codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering parts of the ocean, posing a danger even to ships of neutral countries.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted warfare beneath the sea.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes among most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, the states wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 because he accepted a job at the Edison company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous manager) for Thomas Edison.
The Old China had a unique way of depicting different time periods. Each phase in China's history or each ruling family was recognizable as a dynasty.
Also, the period between each dynasty represented a period of divided provinces. The most famous such period was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those periods, fierce wars were waged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
Three kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for the highest position in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just a single ruler.
Also, after the occupations of the revolution were opened to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military, because instead of ranking military ranks based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed peoples from the working class in other countries to initiate their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in topics beyond this earthly life. He often spent time in a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) and contemplated.
The very cave, which has survived all time, provides a vivid picture of Muhammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find it even if someone knows it exists. When entering the cave, it is complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen but clear, beautiful sky and numerous mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the inside of a cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
On the Giza plateau, or "Giza necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, there is a series of pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" symbol looks like a V, while the "down bow" looks like a connector or a square with the bottom side missing.
Up means that you need to start from the top and push the bow, and down means that you need to start from the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The bow upwards usually creates a softer sound, while the bow downwards is stronger and more declarative.
Feel free to write your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed markings of the bow are designed for music purposes, so they should be respected.
Terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced by the mob of women from the market to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
In the carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who were screaming and shouting threats to the king and queen.
The mob of people forced the king and queen to have the windows on their carriages wide open.
At one point, a mafia member was waving the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The people of the Philippines paid the war costs of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the USA in order to cover a large portion of the costs and interest on bonds that were initiated on behalf of the Government of the Philippines through banks on Wall Street.
Of course, the massive profits coming from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would represent the main gain of US imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The period in which these events took place is usually referred to as the medieval period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The early Middle Ages preceded the developed Middle Ages, and after that came the late Middle Ages, which it was agreed ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological drive or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by the basic logic associated with the laws of science and their portrayal in technology.
Two general ideas are common to most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technology follows a path largely beyond the influence of culture or politics, and that technology in turn has "impacts" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone may say that motor vehicles are necessary for the development of roads.
However, the road network across the country is not economically sustainable for just a few cars, which is why new ways of production have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which leads to the development of new medical techniques for repairing injured bodies.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism, derived from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time customs and culture associated with those geographical areas emerged, and they were, in harmony with the place of society, better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Paris is known as the capital of fashion of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
His status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valued than anything the Byzantine market offered.
At that time, the title of the fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
The way of dressing at the beginning was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Western Europe began to develop its own style towards the end of the Middle Ages. One of the greatest developments of that time as a result of the Crusades was when people started using buttons to fasten their clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture with the goal of producing enough food for the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses saved seeds from a specific eco-region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
From a historical perspective, the majority of farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures gather people of the same beliefs who feel that social standards neglect them and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be recognized by the age, ethnic background, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that make subculture different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of subcultures often show their belonging through specific and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behavior, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is pointing out several unfortunate cases of children who were not provided with socialization by adults during their development due to neglect, accidents, or intentional abuse.
Such children are called "wild" children. Some wild children were therefore confined (usually done by parents); in some cases, children were abandoned because their parents rejected their significant intellectual or physical defects.
Abandoned children may have experienced violence or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
It is believed that the rest were raised by animals. Some are believed to have lived independently in the wild.
After being completely raised by inhuman animals, the wild child exhibits behavior (within physical limitations) that closely resembles the behavior of the animal that cared for him, such as fear and indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning aims to make learning simpler and more interesting, the "scaffolding" method takes it a step further.
"Scaffolding" (supporting) is not a method of learning, but a means of assistance that provides support to individuals going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Help can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is one form of help but also a small person is a connector in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in software and are intended for testing, directing, and explaining procedures that might pose a challenge for a student who needs to carry them out independently.
Children enter the foster care system for various reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even to extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where care, affection, and education are not expressed, but that's happening.
We believe that the Foster Care system represents a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system needs to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Fostering should fulfill all the needs that were unmet in the home they were previously taken from.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
Different characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of access, use, and meeting needs.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered important motives for using the Internet (James et al. 1995).
When researching public reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal involvement" and "continual connections" as new aspects of motivation.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that through the correct interpretation of microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks indicated in his work, "The President's Speech," that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior can be possessed by animals like domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has revealed that there are two types of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, while selection removes expressed variations from the group.
Segregation and recombination mix variations between those two bases in each generation.
The primate with a digestive system similar to humans may have difficulty meeting its amino acid needs from available plant resources in the savanna.
In addition, if not treated in this way, it leads to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest accessible plant resources would be proteins available in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
Unlike them, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a huge amount of protein that contains essential amino acids.
When all is taken into account, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a similar manner as chimpanzees do today in the savannas.
Interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period and then going back to sleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself setting the alarm clock again in your sleep, you can leave it on the other side of the room so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options that are based on biorhythm involve consuming a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, which is a well-known diuretic) before bed, which will force a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in the person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force will be present. Every person has the potential to find their absolute peace and satisfaction.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal are our own tensions and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it is expanded through the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of complete love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through visualization of different deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. In the end of the war, conflicts between systems, processes, and cultures led to disagreements between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies have now become enemies and the cold war has begun.
It would last for the next 40 years and it would be conducted in reality, through intermediary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the defense of Poland had already been broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans practically became obsolete overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of the eastern parts of Poland, thereby violating the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is by far the most efficient way of moving large quantities of goods and a large number of people across the ocean.
The traditional job of a navy is to ensure the country's ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously disrupting the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this practice is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to transfer troops and materials across the Atlantic Ocean in order to provide assistance to Britain.
The German navy attempted to stop this trade mainly using U-boats.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time almost 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were most often kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, and they were often tended to by goatherds, mostly children or adolescents, who were similar to today's shepherds. These methods of livestock farming are still used today.
Wagons were already being produced in England in the 16th century.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve higher speeds and pull more cargo than was the case on slightly rougher roads of that time.
Railway sleepers were introduced quite early for fixing rails. However, it was gradually realized that the rails would be much more efficient if they had a metal strip on top.
This has become a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wagon wheels.
The wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels. The first iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, as people began to walk upright around two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not typically walk upright.
Bipedal specializations were observed in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although there is a possibility that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more friendly towards the environment, we can join the environmental protection movement and we can even become activists to reduce suffering in the future to some extent.
This resembles symptomatic treatment in many cases. But if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problem and eliminate it.
It is clear that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological advancement of humanity, and that the problems have become larger due to overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of people.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to a nearby printing house of John Dunlap.
Around 150 to 200 copies were made of the Dunlap broadsides in the night, now known as the Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of that document was held by John Nixon on July 8th, in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9. The copy arrived in London on August 10.
25 Dunlap's posters for which existence is known are the oldest preserved examples of that document. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with talons and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like T-rexes.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encrypted in the form of binary numbers.
Binary number can have only one of two possible values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are quite general for the diagnosis to be established immediately.
The best indicator of poisoning is the presence of an open box of medication or poisonous household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "beetle" is used by entomologists in a formal context for this group of insects.
This term stems from a long familiarity with bedbugs, insects that are highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Bed bugs are deadly and common bed bugs are crimson, adapted for living in the nest or residential building of their host.
In the United States, there are around 400,000 confirmed cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged individuals.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
The couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to raise the baby.
These couples can make a decision to create a plan for adopting a baby.
During the adoption process, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to determine, through the scientific method, how the world functions. In fact, most scientific research is guided by this method.
However, it is not just experimenting, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, but also asking questions and making observations also lead to scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly on the Bible in Latin language.
Aristotle's views on all questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of the Greeks diminished, the West became cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which do not only represent responses to external periodic stimuli, have been observed in a large number of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to tick even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the leading assumptions that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into the bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled DNA in phage with radioactive phosphorus or labeled phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the specific part of the genetic material, and whether the germ cells are affected.
Only mutations of germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism based on nature attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
The example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small towns on the outskirts by car and go to their workplaces, passing by those who work in the town they just left.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is somehow interconnected and supportive, a transportation system that is based on private cars.
Science now shows that this high carbon-emitting economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear similar complaints about the quality of water or crumbling bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
The traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it is not possible to predict the behavior of drivers with complete certainty.
Luckily, drivers generally behave quite consistently. Therefore, traffic flow has some kind of reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, connections have been established between three fundamental characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to easily avoid enemies and to more effectively search for food and mates.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along their bodies.
This provides them with a wider range of small hiding places from predators.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards today are damselflies and mayflies.
Several thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but the majority believed the opposite claim - that the solar system, including the Sun (and other stars), revolves around the Earth.
It sounds reasonable, because we do not feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and at the same time the largest river on Earth. It has over eight times more water compared to the second largest river.
The Amazon is simultaneously the widest river on Earth, at some places it is up to six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the water that flows into the oceans from rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main river Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from a thousand smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids in Giza were never surpassed in terms of their size and technical perfection of construction.
The new kingdom of the ancient Egyptians marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest number of inhabitants.
The Vatican City uses Italian language for legislation and official communication.
Italian is both a daily language spoken by the majority of the employed in that country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of the Vatican are of Roman Catholic faith.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because all of them can be found in nature in their original form and can be relatively easily exploited using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made from a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also had a theory that they change into new substances and build what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain non-metallic elements in small quantities, such as carbon.
All in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many after it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the development of newer writing methods, the pen has fallen to a lower status and is used less frequently.
People now write messages on computers and never have to buy a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer appears.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a core with a multitude of protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing a heavy stroller uphill. Re-splitting the core releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable cores, which means they have a tendency to decay with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
Tanji is under the seas, and thicker is under the mountains.
On the closer side there might be more marble because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of content are focused on finding what drives people to certain behaviors or attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have outgrown during maturing into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want what they do and what will drive them to do or not do certain things in their environment.
Two popular theories of satisfaction are Maslow's theory of hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can occur when managers start leading their former peers. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulties in making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating staff, assigning tasks, and holding employees accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that they must change everything that team has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately the one who bears responsibility for the success and failure of the team.
This type of behavior often results in disagreement between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, however, there are slight differences.
Members of the virtual team often function as the point of contact for their physical groups.
They often have greater autonomy than other team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which their local leadership may not understand.
The unique component of a virtual team is the presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
"Invisible team" is a management team in front of which every member is responsible. This team sets the standards for every member.
Why would an organization want to go through the process that requires the time to establish a learning organization? One goal for implementing the concepts of organizational learning in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used in functional departments of the organization, creativity and genius can emerge.
As a result, the process of organizing where collaboration is aimed at overcoming barriers can lead to a new innovative process for meeting client needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must establish a culture of innovation, as well as collective knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to studying cognition. Therefore, they narrow the field of research and make it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and brain tumors affect behavior and cause changes in specific mental functions.
The advancement of new technologies allows us to observe and explore brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a large amount of information and materials for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong context of science fiction, it represents an extremely significant branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) involves developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring, planning and sequencing, the ability to provide responses to client diagnoses and questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and faces.
Such things have become separate disciplines aimed at providing solutions to everyday problems.
The artificial intelligence system is commonly used today in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and it is also integrated into several applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a significant part of every class. The teacher would often like to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts in museums, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artwork while sitting in the classroom.
Virtual travel is also a great way to reflect on your journey and share experiences with future students.
For example, every year students of Bennet school in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, this website changes every year, but the old versions are kept on the internet and serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Given that students are often the audience with the most criticism, the blogger begins to strive for improvement in writing in order to avoid criticism.
Also, writing blogs "forces students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to cater to the interests of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing blogs is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand the learning process beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can encourage students to start thinking more analytically and critically. By actively responding to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of what others are writing and can express their own opinion on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
The city of Ottawa is charming, bilingual capital of Canada that is home to numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
The Niagara Falls are located further south, while the unused natural beauty of Muskoka and other areas is located to the north.
All of this and much more sets Ontario apart as what outsiders consider fundamentally Canadian.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, some of them representing almost uninhabited wilderness.
There is a comparison of the population that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the US than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean, along the right coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and represents a continent in itself when it comes to wilderness.
Most small islands are independent states or are associated with France and are known as luxurious resorts with beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to those countries, which particularly took hold in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area to the north is surrounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It can help even if you wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to something that they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow them, grab their hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and do not be afraid to stick to your position (regardless of cultural differences, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by a fisherman from the Berber tribe in the 10th century BC, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake that occurred in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan renovated the city as Daru l-Badža, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old city of Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of souvenirs, but it's all made for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the far east of the country, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, flooding most of the city streets, especially in the center.
Even though Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside of Goma should be thoroughly researched in order to understand the situation of the ongoing conflicts in North Kivu province.
This city is also the starting point for the ascent to the Nyiragongo volcano and one of the cheapest climbs to see the Mountain Gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The standard (local) price for a short ride is approximately 500 Congolese francs.
"Due to the fact that it is quite inaccessible, "Timbuktu" has started to be used as a metaphor for an exotic, distant country."
Today Timbuktu is a impoverished city, although it is a tourist attraction due to its reputation and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered sites of world culture, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS special series Wonders of the African World, hosted by Henry Louis Gates.
This city is completely different from other cities in the country because it has more of an Arabic than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the southern boundary being the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each providing support for various wildlife.
It represents one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading South African national park (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It can be useful to buy a Wild Card which allows entry into some parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gave its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is considered by many tourists to be the main point of visit.
The parade of buildings outlining Hong Kong is connected with a dazzling skyline visible thanks to the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon Harbor on the other side.
Most of the urban area of Hong Kong is densely located on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers took for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, you can start at this place.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) along the coast into the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. Part of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not just saline marshes - they include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km², of which almost one third of the surface is covered by water/marshy areas.
Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for wildlife since 1966, and it is estimated that around 400 Royal Bengal tigers and nearly 30,000 spotted deer inhabit this area today.
Buses depart from the bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most of the district is served by small Japanese buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxi rides are a fast and easy way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge. It stretches over the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, when it is expected that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will be completed.
Guaraní were the most significant indigenous community that lived in the area of present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurúa and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering fruits, and fishing.
Paraguay, whose earlier name was "Giant Province of India," was founded in the 16th century after the encounter of Spanish conquerors with indigenous native groups.
The Spaniards began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having some of the best teams and players in the world.
In December, the largest annual tournament is held on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Here small tournaments and matches can be followed at any time of the year.
For news about tournaments and places where you can buy tickets for half-time matches, check with the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged on the islands at the only bank located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands, and in the city of Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, although it is possible that British and US currency is accepted; check in advance with the owners what method of payment is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside of the island, so exchange your money before you leave.
Considering that Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer there is during the time when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical climate; in summer months, temperatures above +30 °C are common.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but due to a combination of wind and moisture, it feels colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to encounters with humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Owners of the park require that you stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
Despite appearing to be obedient animals, bisons, moose, muskoxen, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year dozens of visitors get injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous. So give them space.
In addition, do not forget that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking food products that smell and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has fewer than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
Luka was the place where the infamous maritime blockade occurred in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the assassination of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasesea Lealofia III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is bordered by two harbors. The most famous beaches are located in three areas.
Beaches on the north coast (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch along Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and a large number have shade from pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata harbor, in the suburb of upper Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good range of shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Broj 1", which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that can be enjoyed, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better for traveling.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you're concerned, you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is different. Short black is "espresso", cappuccino is topped with lots of cream (not froth), and tea is drunk without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but they are excellent.
Trips to the reef are organized throughout the whole year, and injuries on the reef are rare.
However, listen to the advice given to you by the authorities, respect all signs, and pay special attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April, north of the town of 1770. Occasionally they can be seen beyond this period.
The shark, however, rarely attacks people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Sea crocodiles do not live permanently in the ocean. Their primary habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance ensures peace of mind for the traveler because they know they will have accommodation upon arrival at the destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can see that it is possible to book other types of accommodation through the agency, such as campsites.
Tourist agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even a combination of flights and hotel accommodation.
They can hold your reservation if you want to consider the offer or get other documents necessary for traveling to that destination (e.g. a visa).
All changes or requests should first be directed to the tourist agency, not directly to the hotel.
When it comes to some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors choose to camp on site, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will have to enter early to secure a spot for camping near the music.
Remember that even though the music content on the main stages is finished, music may still be played late into the night at some parts of the festival.
At some festivals, there are special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the position of the cabin because passing through the ice causes a terrible noise for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg also include time spent in the city. Passengers on the cruise are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make great efforts to maximize the money and time that guests spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and the exits are difficult to find.
They mostly have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and retain them in the premises.
In some places, alcoholic drinks are served on the house. However, drunkenness impairs the ability to make judgments, and all experienced gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high altitudes or over mountain passes should take into consideration the possibility of snow, ice, or low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and it is not possible to drive as on clear asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall very quickly to get you stuck.
Visibility can be limited by snowfall or blizzard or condensation or ice forming on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal occurrences in many countries and traffic generally continues to flow without interruptions throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the best tourist experience in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to a land journey to see the stunning African wildlife, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars and the standard equipment will provide you with a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better if you look through binoculars.
Safari walking (also known as "bushwalking", "safari hiking", or "hiking") consists of walking for several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some sporting events will also be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics as it was already a host in 1964.
If you have booked flights and accommodation for the year 2020 before the announcement of the delay, you may find yourself in an inconvenient situation.
Policies for cancellations vary, but as of the end of March, the majority of policies for cancellations caused by the coronavirus are not extended beyond July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
The majority of tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, and the price of standard tickets will be around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can speed up their drying. In many hotels, it's possible to borrow an iron and ironing board, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if it is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinking or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are different ways to purify water, some are more effective depending on specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for one minute, while in others it is necessary for several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you're concerned, consider buying water in a closed bottle from a reputable manufacturer.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they haven't seen in their own areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, an allergic reaction, spread poison, or transmit infectious diseases.
Same infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force, are usually not classified as pests.
Shopping in tax-free stores is an opportunity to buy products that are exempt from taxes and excise duties at certain locations.
Passengers traveling to countries with high tax rates can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, as the road often passes through isolated forested areas.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, stay calm: the road is dominated by steep terrain, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The speed limits set are noticeably lower than on previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mi/h (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence is even more important than usual.
It is interesting that the reception for mobile phones here is much stronger than on many other sections of the route, for example in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and diverse, similar to those made by their southern neighbors, the Austrians.
Fruit pastries are common - apples are cooked in dough throughout the year, while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often make a good combination with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but rich pastry, try the pastry called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Kari is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.

Javanese cuisine, now available throughout the archipelago, consists of a variety of simply spiced dishes. The dominant flavors that Javanese people love are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, but can cause safety issues because the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown from the horse and his foot remains in the stirrup, the horse could drag him if it starts to run away. In order to minimize the risk, many safety measures can be taken as a precaution.
Most riders wear riding boots with a heel and flat, fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety levers that allow the leather stirrups to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls them in a fall.
In the Cochamó Valley - a premier climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, there are various large granite walls and cracks.

Snow sports involving downhill descents, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular activities in which you descend down snow-covered terrain on skis or a board attached to your feet.
. Skiing is the main traveler activity of many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "skiing addicts", who plan entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also called skiing off-piste, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, but usually does not include them, with the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a trail that is similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover greater distances than by walking, but you will rarely achieve the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean having to go through the visa application process and passport control multiple times.
However, the Schengen area, in that regard, acts like one country.
As long as you are in this zone, you can cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each Schengen member country, saving time, money, and reducing paperwork.
There is no universal definition for determining which items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit could be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be defined as antiques, although they are newer compared to similar mass-produced goods.
The breeding of reindeer is an important means of livelihood for Sami, and the culture around trade is also important for many with other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sami people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and reindeer were mainly bred as draft animals.
Today, many members of the Sámi people are involved in modern trade. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the area where the Sámi live.

Anyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should have proper training.
By searching the internet for "Hostile Environment Training," you will probably find the address of a local company.
The course usually covers in much more detail all the issues discussed here, often with practical experience.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and involves role-playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes weapon handling training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but there are few publications that deal with the topic of war zones.
Travelers who plan to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports that do not specify gender (X) or documents that are updated to match the desired name and gender is uneven.
The readiness of foreign governments to adhere to these documents also varies greatly.
Searches at checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the period after September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet had surgery should not expect to go through a scanner and maintain their privacy and dignity.
Return currents are the return flow of waves that hit the shore, often a reef or something similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in several deeper parts and there can be a fast current towards deep water.
Most deaths occur from exhaustion as the swimmer tries to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you break free from the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Attempt to aim for somewhere you won't be caught again or, depending on your skills and whether you have been noticed, you may want to wait for rescue.
The shock of re-entry comes before the cultural shock (there is less honeymoon phase), it lasts longer, and it can be more difficult.
Travelers who easily adapted to the new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to readapt to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from your original culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers needed to adapt to a new country.
People may not expect that both patience and understanding are necessary for travelers returning home.

Several countries claim rights to the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and have the most bases on them, with as many as sixteen active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with a settlement called Villa Las Estrellas.
The remaining islands include the islands of Livingston and Deception, where a flooded caldera of an still active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is a region south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into plateaus, then rise again into the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, split by the Minnesota glacier.
The highest mountains in Antarctica are located in the northern part of the Sentinel Range, called the Vinson Massif, whose summit, Mt. Vinson, is 16,050 feet high.
In remote areas not covered by mobile network, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone because you have to make calls outdoors, with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
This service is often used in cargo transportation by ship, including recreational vessels, as well as in expeditions that have needs for exchanging data and voice messages remotely.
Your local phone service provider should provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
The option is becoming increasingly popular for those who plan to travel and learn for a year.
This is very popular among high school graduates, because it allows them to take a gap year before enrolling in college, without compromising their education.

Tuition is usually charged for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands on the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
On archipelagos and lakes, you don't need a yacht.
Although coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are truly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, where one boat arrives for every seven or eight people.
The activity is almost the same in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but other than that, it is completely unique (for example, in the Netherlands, that number is from one to forty).
Most different cruises in the Baltic Sea involve an extended stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
That means you can visit the historical city for several days and return to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only travel along the coast as part of the boat trip, you will not need a special visa (from 2009).
Some cruises in their brochures include Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map, Berlin is not even close to the sea, so a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have not flown before or have had a traumatic experience.

If goods are being shipped by air transport, it may take several days for unloading and customs clearance on some routes.
The only way for the package to pass was to send it as registered luggage. Airline regulations don't allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
A clear way to travel first or business class is to open your wallet and shell out a bunch of money for that privilege (or even better, have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: generally, you can expect to pay up to four times more for the business class than the regular economy class and eleven times more for the first class!
In general, it is not even worth asking for discounts on business or first-class seats for direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova. The official language is Romanian, but Russian is used in many places.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has gone through an ethnic conflict.
That conflict in 1994 resulted in the establishment of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has a government and currency, but has not received recognition from any UN member country.
Economic ties have been established between these two parts of Moldova despite unsuccessful political negotiations.
The most widespread religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.

Please treat this place with the dignity, formality, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not desecrate the place by making or carving graffiti on the buildings.
In Barcelona, Catalan and Spanish are official languages. Almost half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the majority understands it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only listed in Catalan language as it is, by law, the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the Metro are made only in the Catalan language, but the automatic system announces unplanned interruptions in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for their reputation as egocentric, rude, and arrogant individuals.

The abrupt exterior of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show basic kindness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is located in large forests, mostly beech, fir, and spruce, and can boast a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to the range of microclimates, different types of soil, and varying altitudes, there is a very wide range of plant communities.

Men are expected to wear pants below the knee in the same way.
You can also borrow this at the entrance, but this clothing is not washed after every use, so you may not feel comfortable when wearing these aprons. One size is universal for men!

Given that the mild pollution at their peak was not a problem like today, they are usually found in cities or campuses and are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous structures in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Observing the cherry blossom, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept originated in China, where the plum blossom was the flower of choice.
The first cherry blossom parties in Japan were organized by the emperor himself for their own pleasure and for other members of the aristocracy gathered around the imperial court.
Plants look their best when they are in their natural surroundings, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.

Traditional churches hold Easter vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, and members of the congregation begin celebrating right at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals have not been able to reach the island, which made the giant tortoise the main herbivore on the Galapagos.
Ever since humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have also arrived, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
