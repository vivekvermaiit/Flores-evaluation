This cannot be confirmed if there are several dinosaurs that have feathers, a theory that has been widely circulated, but cannot show sufficient details of fossils, including their color and 3-dimensional structure.
The researcher confirmed that the fur of that animal is upperpart brown chestnut but the lower part is gray or carotenoid.
This knowledge is still lacking in the transition of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a central axis called rachis, but have the characteristics of being unruffled and barbless, researchers conclude that the rachis is actually a result of late-stage evolutionary pollution rather than a genuine feature.
The feather structure indicates that it is not used for flying but for regulating temperature or display. It suggests that, even though this dinosaur tail exists, for example, it shows adult feathers rather than bird feathers.
The researchers obtained the idea that, even though this is the tail of an anomalous dinosaur, the sample reveals feathers and young bones.

When a small group of living creatures (small population) separates from the main population of their original habitat (such as moving to the foot of a mountain or a river, or if they move to a new island so that it is not easy to go back), they will often adapt themselves to the new environment over time.
This environment does not have different raw materials from different enemies, so the population does not need different features or adjust to become a strong competitor with smooth boundaries.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptation as before.
When the time comes, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it is expected that the overall population will continue to decrease.
Eventually, after hundreds or even millions of years, two populations will become very different and cannot interbreed as the same species.
This process is called speciation which means the formation of new species. Speciation is the result of unavoidable factors and is a crucial part of evolution.

The 35mm format is preferred, a bit confusing, because its dimensions are 36mm in height and 24mm in width.
