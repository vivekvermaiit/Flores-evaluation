This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as the color and the three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top with a light or carrot-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but have other characteristics of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or decoration. The researchers believed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not a chick's down.
The researchers believe that the sample from the tail of the young dinosaur shows an adult individual's feather coat and not a chicken's down.

The brightness and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The conducted work was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the SagDEG galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be a result of tidal-like forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth and causes tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the SagDEG galaxy.
The researchers were able to conclude that the dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is found around the galaxy in a kind of ring and consists of lots of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very concerning and that there was cause for alarm due to its very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the virus at the hospital, believes Dr. Moll, and at least two were hospital staff.

"Glen Cushing from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona said: "Their thermal behavior indicates that they are quite deep holes in the ground, although they do not behave as stably as large holes on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature throughout the day."
In France, voting has traditionally taken place in a low-tech manner: Voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their candidate choice in an envelope.
When officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The procedure is very accurately codified in the French electoral law.
Voting booths have been transparent since 1988, so that voters and observers can see that the booths do not contain ballots at the start of the election, and that no ballots are added other than those that are correctly counted and come from approved voters.
Candidates can send representatives as witnesses to all parts of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Schneider testified via video link from a USAF base in his home country.
In addition to Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the championship.
Her first event was slalom, where she did not complete her first run. 36 out of the 116 participants achieved the same result in the race.
In her second race, which was the giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a total race time of 4:41.30. 2:11.60 minutes slower than the woman in first place, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished in ninth place.
Four skiers in the women's group for seated athletes did not complete the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not rank in the race.
The police in Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and we have found her mobile phone and laptop".
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court for murdering his son.
She is remanded in custody and awaiting to be accused and go to court, but evidence from eyewitnesses may be flawed because her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish courts operate differently, and the courts have considered the publication of images to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee comments, "It certainly seems that journalists need to be careful when publishing pictures of suspects, etc."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be given, at least until the indictment is available.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border conflict that Palestine wishes to be based on the pre-1967 Six-Day War borders.
Other topics covered reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both countries, as well as the issues surrounding the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement has been signed, while the Palestinian authorities only accept leaving the valley for five years.
Shooters in the supplementary pest control experiment were closely followed by the park attendants, as the experiment was monitored and its effect evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of conservation and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
A new provisional electoral council (CEP) of nine members was sworn in by Martelly yesterday.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the former CEP's resignation was recommended by a presidential commission as part of a package of measures aimed at moving the country towards new elections.
Martelly's response to the extensive anti-regime protests that began in October was the commission.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of holding elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
In about 60 reported cases, defective iPods have overheated, causing a total of six fires and giving four people minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that they had knowledge of 27 accidents related to the units.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of an additional 34 cases of overheating, which the company referred to as "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "quite regrettable."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana's Emergency Management Office announced that there were no reports of damages in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took an older lady's spot when she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He completed training as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would accelerate the development of the baby's lungs in the fetal stage.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also praised Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night with two moons. Quite unique, just like herself. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was as wild as me...maybe even more...love her and going to miss her...hopefully she is in a better place now."
Out of 1,400 people surveyed prior to the 2010 federal election, the number of those against Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the federal election in 2010 that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the survey share this view and wish for Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the various extremes of the referendum, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle events and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, there has been doubt about his condition.
He could not take the medication necessary to combat his pain, as it is prohibited during the games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed this discovery in early February using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water on Earth along with organic material that can form proteins and support life.
Researchers hope to understand how planets are formed, and especially how Earth was formed since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing marriage for same-sex couples.
He referred to the rumors as "political nonsense and foolishness".
One wonders if he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system which, according to the FAA, enables aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel per year, and reduce CO2 emissions.
The system uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older technology based on ground radars, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transportation will be provided and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride options will not be available on the ground.
The fear of lack of transportation raised the possibility of having to play the game behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species was developed in just two generations, even though it was believed that this process would have taken much longer due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch Geospiza fortis and the invasive cactus finch Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be drawn out into a thin cable, which can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into plates.
It can be made very thin and put on other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books, which were called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called a chemical's pH value. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage changes color, depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Brintioner are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Shake the two dry powders together, and then press them together into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system in almost every house.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women mingled together.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To put a satellite or a telescope in space requires a huge rocket that is over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is that it has provided us with much easier and faster transportation methods.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Underneath them are several medium-sized cats, who eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a concept of the niche, a specific task that each cat has, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social big cats and live in large groups called prides.
The groups consist of one to three related adult males, as well as up to thirty females and young.
The Huns are normally closely related to each other and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides react very much like wolves or dogs in packs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete who can climb (although not well), swim, jump far, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion, but sounds more like a series of snarling, yelled words.
Ocelots prefer small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if given the opportunity. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Researchers believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by scent, by sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move very silently around. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population they came from (such as if they move over a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island, so they cannot easily move back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population must have other functions or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it previously needed to be.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two population groups will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Species are an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans inhale, and they take up carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the top of the food chain in its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set at the top of its mouth, meaning there was no escape route for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for certain, but it may have had a split tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came in the water. Even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would be no match for it.
Even though most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate quite a few strange or unusual things, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have grand feasts together, where they lay on their side while eating.
Old Roman meals could not have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They had for example neither corn, tomatoes, potatoes nor cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to fulfill the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, so-called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The Hebrew family lived most of their life outdoors.
Women made the food in the yard; the shops were just open counters facing the street. Stones were used to build houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was settled by few people. In the Nordic sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, there were already Inuit tribes living in the area at that time.
Even though each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That is not true. Even though something is written on the back of the document, it is not a tax card.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" were written on the back of the American Declaration of Independence. The text appears at the bottom of the document when turned upside down.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it's likely that the remark was simply added as an addition.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had freed northern France, but the southern part was still not free.
It was ruled by the French Vichy government - who were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, allied troops invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and were beginning to focus towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a larger, significant group of people who live together and cooperate, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," meaning civil, and is related to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state; and it also somehow defines the size of the society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. A civilization's culture involves the transfer of knowledge across generations, long-lasting cultural influence, and fair representation.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive authority or judiciary, they were dependent on state authorities, who often were not cooperative in enforcing all actions.
It also had no right to disregard tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous acceptance from all the states before they could be changed, and the states were so lax about the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and became FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical standpoint, as an "archipelago"
Taiwan's history begins all the way back in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island named it Ilha Formosa or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in the original grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops take control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and declare Taiwan as a province in the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the excavations continue to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world for still images is 35mm, which was the most widespread film size at the end of the era of analog photography.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, which can seem confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format is therefore 3:2 (divided by twelve to achieve the most simple integer ratio).
Many common formats (such as APS formats) are equal to or close to this image format.
The much abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics and at the same time maintains a certain order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in Europe's history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and influential, was examined more closely.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion bound European countries together despite different languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from kings to ordinary citizens.
One of the most important Christian dogmas is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources are specifically used for this purpose.
The church's central authority had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many question whether this dogma was being properly lived up to.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Britain imposed a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective and prevented important military and civilian supplies from reaching their destination. This blockade was in violation of the recognized international laws, which are codified in several international agreements over the last two centuries.
Great Britain laid mines in the international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, which was a danger even to neutral ships.
Because there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country's unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations' attitudes leaned towards pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the USA to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents on him, a collection of poems, and a written recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different time periods were displayed in a unique way; each Chinese time period or each family in power was a separate dynasty.
In addition, there was an unstable period with divided provinces between each dynasty. The most well-known of these periods was the era of the three kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was fierce war between many noblemen, who fought for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China's history. Thousands of people died in the struggle to sit in the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not one ruler.
After the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, which made it possible for the most ambitious and successful to do well.
The same applies to the military, because instead of class-based ranking in the army, the ranking was now based on caliber.
The French revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own internal revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in relationships beyond the worldly life. He used to visit a cave, which became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) to immerse himself in his thoughts.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. When you're inside the cave, it's a total isolation.
Only the clear beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
The great pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (of which the world-famous Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-bow" mark looks like a V and the "down-bow" mark looks like a staple, or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means you start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Upstrokes usually produce a softer sound, while downstrokes sound stronger and more powerful.
You can always insert your own markings, but remember that the inserted bow markings are determined by musical reasons, and so they should usually be respected.
King Louis 16, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789 by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming group of people shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows in their carriage completely open.
At one point, a member of the mafia presented the head of a royal guard, who was killed at Versailles, to the scared queen.
The war expenses for American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
The Philippines had to pay taxes to the American colonial power to raise money for the bulk of expenses, and the bond interest ran through the banks on Wall Street in the government's name.
Of course, the super profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to the establishment of the order.
The period during which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the part of European history that occurred in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice from technology as a driving force or technological necessity, to a narrow idea that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic connected to scientific laws and the way they manifest in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a route largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has an "impact" on societies that is inherited and not socially conditioned.
For example, one can say that the motor-driven car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
But a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of owning a car.
When many people own cars, there are also more accidents on the roads, leading to the invention of new techniques in the healthcare sector to heal bodily injuries.
The Romantic period contained a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
During Romanticism, it was geography that shaped the individual, and over time customs and cultures related to geography emerged, and these were in harmony with the society's location and therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way as Paris is known as the fashion capital in the modern world today, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
It is known for being an epicenter of luxury since around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which had a greater value than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at that time that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most prevalent in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, the clothing was largely inspired by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, the Western styles could lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people started using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is farming carried out to produce enough food to only meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses locally adapted seeds in the eco-region, in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring like-minded individuals together, who feel overlooked by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characteristic due to the age, ethnic background, social class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that regulate a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
People belonging to a subculture often signal their belonging through a clear and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases where children have not been socialized by adults in their childhood through neglect, accident, or intentional neglect.
such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been deprived of their freedom by humans (most often their own parents); in some cases, this neglect was caused by the parents' rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced serious child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behavior (within physical boundaries) that is nearly identical to the animal that has cared for the child, such as its fear or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a support for people who need to learn something new - for example, using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized in the software, and aim to question, prompt, and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children come into foster families for a wide range of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment without nourishment, care, and education, but nonetheless they do.
We view the foster care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide secure homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
A foster family is tasked with providing all necessities that were missing in the home they were removed from.
The internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The special characteristics of the Internet lead to further dimensions in terms of usage and satisfaction access.
For example, it is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motives for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "sustained relationship" were also identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in understanding micro expressions, which are facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
Especially it is claimed that one can identify whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks indicated how people who are not able to understand speech due to a brain injury are nevertheless able to assess sincerity with great accuracy.
He even believes that such abilities to interpret human behavior can also be found in pets such as dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two different pools of genetic variation: the invisible and the visible.
New genetic variation is added through mutation, and it is removed from the pool of exact variations through selection.
Separation and recombination mix the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy their need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, there are serious consequences of non-compliance: reduced growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins that exist in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest. It also provides large amounts of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
All in all, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in roughly the same way as chimps on the savannah do today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of consciously waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm clock while you sleep, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before sleep, which forces one to get up and use the bathroom.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is completely opposite to the amount of tension a person possesses in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the life force. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can learn to understand. The only thing standing in the way of achieving this goal is our own tension and negativity.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was expanded by the Mahayana path of loving-kindness and with a lot of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened (enlightenment energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center for Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to collaboration between the Soviet Union and the USA. When the war ended, the difference in the countries' systems, processes, and cultures led to them opposing each other.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies turned into enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, became outdated almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army invaded and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Polish-Soviet non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for freight transport is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of both people and goods across the seas.
The traditional task of the navy has been to ensure that your country continues to have the ability to move your people and your goods, while also affecting your enemy's ability to move its people and its goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in the Second World War. The Americans tried to transport soldiers and materials across the Atlantic to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Great Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
As far as is known, goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Old cultures and tribes began to keep them so they could have easy access to milk, fur, meat, and skin.
House goats were generally kept in flocks that roamed on hills or other grassy areas, often supervised by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, equivalent to the more commonly known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, roads were built in England.
Even though the lanes consisted just of parallel wooden planks, they meant that horses could pull heavier loads faster than on the slightly more uneven roads of the time.
Sleeper was invented quite early, to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that tracks would be more effective if they had an iron piece on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In the end, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first metal-only tracks were used.
The first known method of transportation was walking, as humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
There are bipedal specializations in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases like treating symptoms. But if we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and problems have become greater due to overpopulation and mankind's extravagant lifestyle.
After Congress adopted it on July 4th, a handwritten draft was signed by Congress President John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomsen was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was performed by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and on July 9th he had it read to his soldiers in New York. On August 10th, a copy reached London.
The 25 Dunlap sheets, which still exist, are the oldest surviving version of the document. The original handwritten version no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live. We call them birds.
Most people do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that remind us of dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information coded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one out of two values, for example 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer language for now.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to immediately make a diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.
This expression stems from ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects that largely live as parasites on humans.
Both bed bugs and carpet beetles are nidicolous, which means they are adapted to living in their host's home or nest.
Across the USA, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the largest neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system consisting of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women have twice the risk of getting MS than men.
A couple can decide that it is not best for them or their child to have a baby.
It is possible for these couples to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take them over.
The main goal of science is to figure out how the world works through the scientific method. This method is actually used in most scientific investigations.
It does not stand alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also leads to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek disappeared, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many of the observations made within physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and natural biological production.
Periodic rhythms, which are not reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue for a period with free-running cycles, even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading pieces of evidence that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments where they either marked the DNA in the cell with radioactively labeled phosphorus or the protein in the cell with radioactively labeled sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the purpose of enjoying the landscape and plant and animal life.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visits to parks as well as studies of information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Where in the morning people leave small villages by car to go to their workplace, and are passed by others whose workplaces are the place they have just left.
On this dynamic ferry, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
The decarbonized economy has released the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human development for a couple of million years, according to science now.
Everyone is part of the society and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems give rise to such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is a study of the individual drivers' and vehicles' movements between two points, and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, motorists typically behave reasonably consistently; thus, traffic is also typically reasonably consistent and can be calculated mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These conditions help to plan, design, and operate road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly into the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them a greater selection of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the dragonfly and the mayfly are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the Sun.
There were divided opinions about his theory - some thought he was right, while many thought the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the earth.
It makes sense, because we can't feel the earth spinning, can we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth. It contains over 8 times as much water as the Earth's second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river in the world, and in some places it is up to six miles (approximately 9.6 km) wide.
20 percent of the water flowing through the planet's rivers and into the seas comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River collects water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the main river itself is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long.
Even though pyramid construction with stone continued until the end of the old kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical expertise in construction.
The ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom were amazed by their ancestors' monuments, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of the Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they exist in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to dig for if you have the right tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had the theory that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements. Namely, earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, even though he also had a theory that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basic mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many substances in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit inside the period that ends this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend for most people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost its status and is being used less since new writing methods have emerged.
People now write messages through computer screens and never need to go near a pencil sharpener.
One can only guess what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a core with many protons and neutrons.
A little like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down with little or no prompting.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the front and 100 km thick on the back.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the highland.
There may be several lunar seas on the front, as the crust here is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around figuring out what makes people react, or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
The theories examine what it is about certain people that causes them to perform specific actions, and what elements in their surroundings cause them to carry out or abstain from specific actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs, and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, there can be two types of behavior when a manager starts leading his former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of leader finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, delegate responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team has accomplished and make it their own.
In the end, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This behavior often results in problems between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The same expectations for expertise are placed on virtual teams as conventional teams, but there are small differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as their team can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team that each member reports to. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of translating organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and inventiveness begin to show when all available resources are effectively utilized across an organization's functional departments.
As a result, the process in an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process meeting the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture that promotes innovation as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that can help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows down the research area and makes it much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us plenty of information and materials to build simulation models which can help us understand our mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves being able to create machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, with a focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering, and military business areas, as it has been integrated into numerous personal computers and software applications for computer games.
Excursions are a big part of any class. Quite often, a teacher would love to take their students to places that are not possible to travel to by bus.
The technology offers solutions with virtual excursions. Students can look at museum objects, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful artworks while sitting in the classroom.
To share a field trip virtually is also a good method to evaluate a field trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, design students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a website every year about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website gets rebuilt, but old versions still exist online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally corrects this.
As students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, "blogging forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The demand to give the audience what they want inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical; by providing active responses to online materials, students can define their roles in relation to what others have written and describe their own perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and has a variety of art galleries and museums that exhibit Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the northern part is home to Muskoka and other areas of untapped natural beauty.
All these things, as well as more, highlight Ontario as what is considered genuine Canadian by outsiders.
Further up north, there are large areas that are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the largest and is a continent in itself when it comes to wild animals.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France and known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and the religion quickly spread in Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism started in the 15th century with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's discovery of the Cape Route between Europe and India.
In the north, the region borders on the Sahel, and in the south and west on the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is sensible to wear what may resemble a wedding ring (it just shouldn't look too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be assertive when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to say no (cultural differences or not, it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids, called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to leave it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes, and a wide range of trinkets, but it is very touristy.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
Despite Goma being fairly safe, all visits outside Goma should be explored to understand the conflicts taking place in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and one of the cheapest places to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Together with the relative inaccessibility of the city, this has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, distant regions.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites due to the threat from desert sands.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' special Wonders of the African World for PBS.
The city stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has more of an Arabic flair than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees to the park.
It can also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, as this either grants access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider the primary focus area.
Hong Kong's skyline is a group of buildings, which, by their reflection in the water of Victoria Harbour, are often compared to a glittering bar chart.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The majority of Hong Kong’s urban development is tightly packed on reclaimed land areas along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers made their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km from the coast into the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps — they include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty forests that once covered the colossal plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which around one third is covered by water/marshlands.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 chital deer in the area.
Buses run from the cross-regional bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses in the district are often full, it's a good idea to buy a ticket a couple of days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, Japanese buses, which are both comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxies are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It stretches over the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011. It first opened for traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully functional in September 2017 when the Brazilian customs control posts are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant group of natives living in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture for survival.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as "the great province of the Indians," came into being in the 16th century as a result of the meeting between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous population groups.
The Spaniards began the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the world's best polo teams as well as some of the world's best players.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets, you can inquire at the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is pegged to the value of a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and American dollars are also often accepted.
On the outlying islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and American currency may be used; ask the owners in advance to find out which payment method is accepted.
It is nearly impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside of the islands, so make sure to exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter on the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, it is normal to have temperatures over 30°C.
The winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely reach below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than what is stated on the thermometer.
There are no particular "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains fairly the same throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may appear, bisons, moose, bears, and virtually all large animals can still attack.
Every year a lot of visitors get injured because they don't keep a proper distance. These animals are big, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, you should be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking food that smells, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the setting for a notorious fleet confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk except for a British cruise ship. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, there was a peaceful gathering in the city that resulted in the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is close to two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are nearly all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most have natural shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located along the Waitemata Harbour in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the sea. It is safe to swim here.
The most widespread local beer is "Number One," which is not a complicated beer but is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better to transport.
It is completely safe to drink the local water from the tap, but it is easy to find bottled water if you are concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A "short black" is called "espresso", cappuccino has plenty of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate lives up to the Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent in return.
Many visit the reef all year round, and people rarely get hurt on the reef for these reasons.
Always listen to advice from the authorities, read and follow advice on signs, and pay great attention to safety warnings.
Yellowjackets are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally also be found outside of these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live their active life in the ocean, their primary habitat is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives the traveler peace of mind knowing they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have offers on specific hotels, although it may be possible for you to book other forms of accommodation through a travel agent, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Changes or requests should, however, be directed to the travel organizer first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of participants choose to camp on site at music festivals, and many participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be where the action is, you need to get in early to get a tent spot close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages has ended, there may still be parts of the festival that play music late into the evening.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
Check where your cabin is if you cross the Baltic Sea in the winter, as sailing through ice can be quite noisy for those closest to it.
Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (see terms), which is good to know, as cruises to St. Petersburg allow passengers time to see the city.
Casinos do everything they can to make guests spend as much time and money as possible. Windows and clocks are usually not present, and it can be difficult to find an exit.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and keep them in the house.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks on the house. But intoxication weakens judgment, and all true gamblers know how important it is to be sober.
All who are going to drive on high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, and sub-zero temperatures.
On ice and slippery roads, there is low friction, and you cannot drive as you normally would on dry asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and slippery conditions are common in many countries, and traffic flows mostly undisturbed all year round.
Safaris are the highlight for many and may be what attracts the most tourists to Africa.
The term safari is often used to refer to land travels to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes have a tendency to approach the cars, and standard equipment is therefore enough to see the animals.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "walking safari," or "safari on foot") consists of hikes that either take a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it also hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may run into trouble.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help to dry it. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow, even if there isn't one in the room.
If you don't have the option to use an iron, or if you don't like wearing socks that are ironed, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinking or in extreme cases, scorch marks).
There are different ways to purify water, where some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers can encounter pests that they are not familiar with from home.
Pests can ruin food, cause irritation, or in worse cases, provoke allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases in themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people, are normally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods at certain locations that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travelers on their way to countries with a high tax rate can sometimes save significant amounts, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through isolated terrain in the hinterland.
Stay sharp if you're not used to driving on country roads: there are plenty of steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The set speed limits are noticeably lower than on stretches before and after - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and it is even more important than usual to adhere to them precisely.
Oddly enough, the coverage on mobile phones is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very flavorful and varied just like in Germany's southern neighbor, Austria.
Baked goods with fruit are common: apples are baked into cakes year round, and cherries and plums make their appearance during the summer.
Much German pastry also contains almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes and a strong cup of coffee often go hand in hand.
If you fancy some small, but substantial, cakes, you can try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry is either "dry" or "wet" depending on how much liquid is in it.
In the inner regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry dishes. In southern India and some other coastal regions on the subcontinent, it is common to use coconut milk.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a general term that covers a wide range of regional food cultures found throughout the country.
But if the phrase is used without further elaboration, it typically refers to the food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now the Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago; it consists of a variety of simply spiced dishes, where the most popular spices are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang down on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can cause safety issues due to the possibility of a rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged along if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, some safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, many riders use riding boots with a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety stirrups that release the stirrup straps from the saddle if pulled backward by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's largest climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, has a number of large granite walls and cliffs.
Mountain peaks present absolutely breathtaking views from the tops for all visitors. Climbers from around the world are constantly establishing new routes among its endless potentials for new climbing walls.
Alpine winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports activities that involve riding down snow-covered terrains with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts - sometimes known as "ski bums" who plan their whole vacation around skiing in a specific area.
People have been skiing for thousands of years - cave paintings dating back to 5000 BC show people skiing!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates all the way back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski trekking.
It is related to, but usually does not involve alpine-style skiing or mountaineering. The latter is performed in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
You should consider the ski route as if it were a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover much greater distances than if you are walking - but it is only very rarely that you will achieve the same speed as on cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on groomed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
In this context, the Schengen area functions more or less as one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
In the same way, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for which manufactured goods are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods that are over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit can be lower, for example in North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be categorized as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture surrounding it is also important for many Sami with other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami people kept reindeer on a large scale, but they lived off fishing, hunting, and the like and mainly used reindeer as draught animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
Although the word "gypsy" is often used especially among non-Roma people, it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If travel advisories arise in the country you are visiting, your travel insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
It may also be that you want to seek advice from other governments than your own, but their advice will be tailored to their own citizens.
One example is that American citizens in the Middle East may face a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
The consultations are just a brief overview of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often with a brief focus on the matter, general and simplified compared to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Extreme weather conditions are the general designation for all dangerous weather phenomena that can cause damage or serious societal disruptions or cost human lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur all over the world, and there are different types that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, extreme rainfall, and forest fires are forms of, and effects of, severe weather, just like thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include snowstorms, blizzards, freezing rain, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather conditions that may affect their area, as it may impact any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
A search on the internet for "Course in hostile environment" will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course will usually cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, typically with practical experience.
A course will typically last from 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes there will be weapon training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wilderness are common, but there aren't many publications that deal with war zones.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgeries abroad need to make sure to bring valid documents for the return journey.
The government's willingness to cooperate varies when it comes to issuing passports with unspecified gender (X), or documents that are updated to give a person a desired name and gender.
The foreign governments' willingness to respect these documents varies just as much.
Visitor screenings at security checkpoints have also become more intrusive in the period since September 11, 2001.
Transgender passengers who have not had surgery should not expect to go through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The current from waves returning and breaking on the beach, often at a reef or similar, is called a rip current.
Due to the topology underwater, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a fast current can form towards deep water.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you release from the current, it is no harder than usual to swim back.
Try to aim for a place where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been discovered, you may have to wait to be rescued.
Homecoming shock comes faster than culture shock (there is not the same degree of excitement over the new), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who easily adapt to the new culture sometimes have a very hard time adapting to their own culture.
When you come home again after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you traveled abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, as they knew that a traveler in a completely new country needs to adapt.
People do not necessarily expect it to be necessary to show patience and understanding when returning home as a traveler.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting activities in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness, and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Normally, you always hear the sound of tourists and sellers. The story of the sound and the light is like a storybook.
The sphinx is set as background and tells a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and the different pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819 and claimed by many nations, have the most bases, sixteen of which are active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest one is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Other includes Livingston Island and Deception, where an active volcano's flooded caldera provides a spectacular natural harbor area.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula meet on the high plain and form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, Vinson Massif (also called Mount Vinson), which peaks at 4,892 m.
In remote areas without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure crafts, as well as expeditions in need of remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
A possibility that is becoming more and more popular for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among those leaving school, as it gives them the opportunity to take a gap year before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during your gap year can actually improve your chances of getting into higher education in your home country.
There will typically be a tuition fee to sign up for these educational programs.
Finland is a fantastic destination for sailors. "The land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and in the archipelagos along the coast.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are big enough for any yacht, you get a different experience in a smaller boat or even a kayak.
Sailing is a national hobby in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is somewhat similar to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in Holland the number forty is et til fyrre).
On most Baltic cruises, an extended stay in St. Petersburg in Russia is offered.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days, where you come back and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore with the ship's excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises have Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea at all and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
It can be a scary experience to travel by plane for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the fear and hatred towards other things that many people suffer from.
For some, understanding how an airplane functions and what happens during flight can help overcome a fear based on the unknown or lack of control.
Delivery companies charge a lot for fast delivery. Often, time is very important when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and in smaller companies there was a problem.
If they sent items via air freight, it may have taken days to get through unloading and customs on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline rules do not allow them to send baggage without a passenger. That's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to lay down a large pile of money to get the opportunity (or even better, have your company do it for you).
This is certainly not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal price of economy class for business class and eleven times the price for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no reason whatsoever to look for discounts on seats in business or first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that certain core groups of passengers are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of traveling quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly.
Moldova's capital is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any member countries of the UN.
Economic ties have been reestablished between these two parts of Moldova despite the breakdown in political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third largest city with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the country's second largest port after Istanbul, and a very large transportation hub.
What once was the old city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and busy trading city located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass facade buildings and modern shopping centers are surrounded by traditional red tiled roofs, the old market from the 18th century and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.

Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site. A place that has a crucial significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not tell jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the place with markings or by engraving graffiti on the structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Around half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
Most signs, however, are only indicated in Catalan, because it has been established as the official language by law.
Still, Spanish is also used a lot, in public transport and other facilities.
General announcements in the metro are only given in Catalan, but unforeseen changes are announced through an automatic system in several different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-absorbed, rude and arrogant.
Even though this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is still to behave as nicely as possible, you should act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will make it significantly easier to get around.
The cool exterior of Parisians quickly evaporates if you show basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is filled with forested areas - mainly with beech and coniferous trees - and offers a mix of both alpine plants and Mediterranean plants.
It has a remarkably wide range of plant communities due to its many microclimates, different soil types, and varying altitude levels.
The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animals and bird species.
Here one can find rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and aurochs, along with many more common species.
During visits to the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees, while also having their shoulders covered.
Most of the monasteries have scarves for women who show up unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially some with strong colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
In the same way, it is required that men wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can be borrowed from the storage at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so maybe you are not entirely comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
The Majorcan cuisine, like other similar areas around the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and the use of a lot of olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato and any kind of available accompaniments such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word "Sie" for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.

People who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough to not to need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually outdated today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution wasn't as much of a problem in their heyday as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, where they are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Looking at blooming cherry blossom trees, known as Hanami, has been a tradition in Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where flowers from plum trees were the chosen flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in a natural environment, so you should resist the temptation to "just take one sample."
If you visit a publicly accessible garden, you will be thrown out without discussion if you collect "samples".
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit and very easy to navigate around, and you can buy almost anything once you have arrived.
But when you are in the "high tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (all the time) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is more rare).
There are also a few buses that run north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure to check if the bus you are considering taking drives into Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians from around the world have adopted many of the holiday traditions.
There is a tradition of staying awake on Easter night to watch the sunrise at a special location.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could very well be a spring and fertility ritual from before Christianity.
The more traditional churches often hold Easter vigil on Saturday evening in the Easter weekend, where congregations often break out into celebration at midnight to commemorate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since the first people arrived in Galapagos, many mammals have been imported such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit Arctic or Antarctic areas during winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not come up over the horizon.
This provides a great opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
Since there aren't many people living in the area, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is important, and therefore emphasizes group effort over praise of individual performance.
