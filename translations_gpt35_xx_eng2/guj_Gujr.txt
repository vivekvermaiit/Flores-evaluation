When living organisms form a small group of living things (microorganisms) separated from their main group (for example, when they move from a mountain or river, or reach a new island from which they cannot return), they find themselves in a new environment before doing so.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so to make the new generation strong competitors, they will need different facilities or adjustments that were necessary before.
The basic population is simple but not changeable, they still need the same compatibility as before.
As time passes, new residents may find themselves adapting to their new environment, looking less and less like the other residents.
After thousands or millions of years, two populations of the same species may become so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
We should call this process specificity, which only refers to the formation of new species. Clarification is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.

Failure to do so can also have serious consequences: growth stunting, depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources for proteins are found in grains and pulses, but if they are not cooked properly, it can be difficult to digest for animals like humans.
