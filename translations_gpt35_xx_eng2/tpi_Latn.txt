Martelly conducted the swearing in of a new member of a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in the east.
This is the fifth CEP number of Martelly inside the envelope this year.
By the end of the month, a presidential commission made recommendations that the former CEP must resign as part of the country's move towards new elections.
This commission is something Martelly does because of the 'anti-regime' protests that are happening everywhere and started in October.
This protest often brings anger and pain and they are working to become stronger because there is no election, some are expecting it to happen in 2011.

Some people used different 'hardware' and 'software' in the beginning of February to test if this is correct and they will report on this on Tuesday.
It looks like the comet has collected a variety of things that produce water on the ground along with other organic matter that can produce proteins and support life.
The scientists want to study how the planets formed, especially how Earth came to be, when the comet collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, immediately started his work as the governor of this state this year and signed a 'bill' last month that allowed men to marry men and women to marry women.

There is no other transport available on the ground, and the trains that run on the ground will stop at Wembley, and the place to put the car and make a 'park-and-ride' will not be able to operate.
The lack of transportation options is making it seem like this game will only be played in a place where there is no support.
A study published in the Fonde journal called "Science" provides information about a new species of bird found on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
The researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have produced a report on a new 'species' that has emerged in both generations, but they believe this process will take much longer, as it is arising from the 'breeding' of the Darwin's finch of this area, Geospiza fortis, and the cactus finch from another area, Geospiza conirostris.
Goal is that they can make it into various shapes. And they can roll it and make various small shapes.
They can pull it and make it into a small round shape, then they can fold and tie it. They can beat it on the ground or roll it to make sheets.
They can make it come out burnt and very easily damaged and stick it to other metal. Sometimes they can make it come out very burnt and use it to decorate the pictures that they paint with their hands and inside the book that they call "illuminated manuscripts".
This is what they call the pH of a chemical. You can make an 'indicator' with red cabbage juice.
The pH of cabbage juice can be used to determine whether a substance is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The hydrogen ion (this H inside the pH) is inside the chemical that they test to show the pH level.
The 'ions' of Hydrogen are the 'protons' that have removed the 'electrons' (because the Hydrogen 'atom' has one 'proton' and one 'electron').
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with a clean, wet hand, squeeze them to make a paste.
This water is in your hand and will react with the layers outside, which will create a different kind of salt.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have a toilet that uses water near every house, and it is connected to another type of sewage system.
The old things that show these 'sewage systems' were found in the houses of the cities of Minoan of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
I have the toilets of ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the time of Rome, the toilets were like public restrooms where men and women would go together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you can use a satellite.
This 'satellite' in 'space' got this call and sent it back down, true indeed.
This 'satellite' is a 'rocket' that was sent into 'space'. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere can distort some of our light and how we see things.
They use a giant rocket, its height wins 100 feet to put a telescope into space.
This wheel changes the ground in different ways. A very important thing that the wheel makes for us is it gives us a means of transportation that can move faster.
He gave us a train, car, and many other vehicles for transportation.
Early in the morning, they hunt wild cats that eat wild abuse rabbit and go to antelope and deer.
True, there are many small animals (along with those we can look after around the house) that eat small harmful things like insects, rats, lizards, and fish.
The secret of how they can stay well is this thing they call 'niche', a special job each cat can do and it doesn't compete with another.
The lions are the cats that like to stay with other cats, and they stay with the big group called 'pride'.
The 'pride' usually has one person going on the journey with three men, along with a woman and child.
The women come from one family, like a big family of sisters and their daughters.
The 'pride' of lions is often seen as similar to the 'pack' of wolves or dogs, these animals that are similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and they also produce large offspring compared to other animals that they eat.
A good athlete, the tiger can claim (he doesn't claim too much), swim, jump over big obstacles and carry heavy things with strong arms five times stronger than a man's strength.
Tigers are part of the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These other big cats can also roar.
The roar of a tiger is described as a "full-voiced roar" of a lion, but it is closely resembled to a sentence of a man pulling a win when he is angry and shouting.
The 'ocelots' like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if they can catch them. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are smaller than them.
The scientists think that ocelots often follow and hunt other animals for food (hunting for food) when they smell something, they locate the scent of it on the ground.
They can see very well at night with 'night vision', and they can move silently. 'Ocelots' search for their food when they hunt something in the environment and pounce on the animals they want to catch.
When a small group of animals (a small number) leaves a large population from which they come (if they move up to a mountain or a little stream, or if they move to a new island and search for a place to go back), they will see that they are in a different environment than before.
This new environment has all sorts of risks and competitions, so this new population will need to adopt new, stronger ways of doing things than they were used to before.
This population is not large, but they need to make the same decisions in their environment as before.
Later on, this new population will start making changes and adapting to the new environment of the others, they will start to look down on other populations.
I will go and then after a few thousand or million years, these two populations will look different from each other and people will not say that they are one 'species'.
We are calling this process 'speciation', this means the formation of new 'species'. 'Speciation' is something that we cannot ignore and is an important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that we humans inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide that we exhale (this is when we inhale and exhale).
Plants make their food from sunlight through the process of photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We can build our houses with plenty of plants and we can make our clothes with plenty of plants. There are many foods that we can eat from the plants. If there are no plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaurus was like the top animal at that time, there was no other animal that could eat them, so they were not afraid of anything. They only feared other mosasauruses.
His mouse has more than 70 teeth that act as a rake, along with another row of teeth on the roof of the mouth. This means that whatever he chews cannot escape his mouth.
We cannot swim, but he is good at fishing. He eats turtles, big fish, and other sea creatures, and he even eats people too.
He can eat anything that goes into the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex will not be able to stop it.
Nevermind how many of their boats we know, the Romani have foods we don't know about, they eat during big feasts, like the peacock, snail, and a type of rat called the dormouse.
A different thing that is hurtful is when people who do not have much to eat envy the rich people's abundant food while they are sitting at the table, the poor people always want to have a lot of delicious food to eat while they sleep on their side and eat.
The people from ancient Rome did not have food that came from America or Asia where they are now in Europe hundreds of years later.
One example is that they do not have corn, or tomato, or potato, or cocoa, and there is no one of the past people's languages that was tested on a turkey in Rome.
The people of Babylon built a number one temple for each of their gods which they made as the house for these gods.
The men will bring things to offer to the gods and the priests will try to prepare something that the gods need when they perform ceremonies and big church gatherings.
Each temple has an outdoor area for walking around and an indoor area where only priests can go inside.
Sometimes, special towers that are shaped like pyramids are called ziggurats, and they are usually built as part of temples.
This altar is a special place for this god.
In the places that are hot in the Middle East, the house is not important.
Many things in the lives of Hebrew families can happen outside the house.
The women cook food outside on the side of the house; the stove is the table that is open and looks out to the road. They use stones to build the houses.
I don't have big buses in the land of Canaan, and that's why planning it is very expensive.
I don't have many friends living in Greenland. In the old stories of Norway, they say that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland because he killed a man, and when he traveled to the west, he found Greenland and gave it that name.
However, though they are looking for this place, all the Eskimos who used to live here are gone now.
Never mind, every country in Scandinavia has many things unique to their people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that they wrote a 'treasure map' on the back of the Declaration of Independence paper.
However, this is not true. Even though there may be something written on the back of a document, this is not a 'treasure map'.
They write this phrase on the back of the Declaration of Independence paper "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". This phrase is at the top of this document, and it is 'upside down'.
When no man knows who wrote these words, they say that at the time it was brand-new, this large 'parchment' document (its size is 29¾ 'inches' by 24½ 'inches') was rolled up so it can be stored.
Like this, it looks like this type of speech was written behind it will be able to stay like a 'label'.
The D-Day 'landings' and other battles made France free, but the south has not yet become free.
Their hope is the "Vichy" French were betrayed. These people, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the people who came to take their country and did not fight against them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded the southern coast of France, the operation was called "Operation Dragoon".
During the two weeks only the soldiers of America and the Free French made a southern side of France become free and they worked to go to Germany.
A 'civilization' is a culture where many people who live together and work together is a 'society'.
This word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis", meaning "civil", and is related to the Latin word "civis", meaning "citizen", and "civitas", meaning city or city-state, and also refers to the concept of "society".
The 'city-states' are things that can form a country. Inside a 'civilizational culture', people pass on knowledge for many generations, a kind of footprint of the culture that stays and is passed on to others.
Many times, young people are quick to dismiss the evidence of the history of their ancestors, and they cannot see them as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the states created a weak central government - Congress was only one component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress does not have the power to make and take taxes, and because it does not have a 'national executive' or 'judiciary', it can use state authorities, who cannot work with it for a long time, to make people follow its act.
And secondly, there is no authority to change the tax laws and tariffs, especially at the state level.
The 'Articles' need people to consent to be okay with all the 'states' before they can make decisions and the 'states' receive direction from the 'central government' so people who make decisions are unaware.
The national football team of Italy, along with the national football team of Germany, is the only team that has been really good in all parts of the world and they were champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
The term 'sport' refers to various activities such as football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing, which many people participate in.
The 'winter sport' is popular among people in the Northern regions, and people in Italy often participate in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has 7,000 islands (the largest island is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest island country in the world.
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, people commonly refer to Japan as an "archipelago" in geography.
The establishment of Taiwan began in the 15th century when European sailors discovered and recorded its name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a settlement in 'southwestern' Taiwan, which immediately became a series of plantations producing grains when they brought Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the soldiers of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) conquered and took control of the 'western' and 'northern' regions of Taiwan, declaring Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the end of the fighting in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which gave power of Taiwan to Japan, who held the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three large structures, named Intihuatana, Temple of the Sun, and Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings located in the vicinity of this structure were built to help tourists understand what kind of place this structure used to be.
In 1976, the percentage of Machu Picchu's restoration was almost complete and they were still working on finishing it today.
Example, 'still image photography' refers to a format that many people are familiar with, which is 35mm, which is the most common type of 'film' used in analog photography.
They made it yesterday, but the most important thing is the aspect ratio of its digital camera image sensor format.
The 35mm format can produce images with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm, resulting in a panoramic effect.
The aspect ratio of this format is divided by twelve to obtain a small whole-number ratio, and the ratio is 3:2.
Many formats (formats) that people use (for example, APS is their family's format) are different or closely related as this 'aspect ratio'.
This 'rule of thirds' is a useful guideline that helps to create a good photo and has some other elements in a picture.
He said that it is a good place for a subject to be in time to take a photo in a place where people break the picture and go in three ways 'vertically' and 'horizontally' (see example).
During this time, the Catholic Church had a lot of money and power, so they really controlled him well.
For over a thousand years, this Christian religion has united the countries of Europe, even though they have different languages and customs.
This powerful leader brought change to everyone. He stood as a king and ruled over nameless and numberless people.
One of the big beliefs of Christians is that they must use their money and resources to help others who are in need or do not have money and food. They believe that the church's money is for doing this work.
A man went to check on the church's work for a thousand years and lots of power and money is in the church. This makes many people believe that there are two thoughts if it can overcome this belief, or not.
Later, when the fighting started, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This plan of theirs worked well, they were able to stop essential supplies from reaching the military and the people, even though this 'blockade' violated international law that was established within the agreements of the past century.
Britan put bombs in the international waters to stop ships from going into the large ocean trench, this also caused damage to other ships not involved in this conflict.
Because they cannot see it coming with this 'tactic', Germany thinks something like this will come from its submarines.
In the years of 1920, the way of a big number of citizens and countries is to get belly and to stay together.
The countries looked back on the past pain and suffering of war that occurred during World War I and want to prevent this kind of thing from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to work with the Edison Company in New York City.
It came to the US with 4 cents, a 'poetry' book, and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China has a unique way of showing different periods; each 'stage' of China is a "dynasty" held by a family.
Secondly, the name 'dynasty' has a time when all provinces exist. One of those times when many people are aware of is the time of the Three Kingdoms which lasted for 60 years, named the Han and Jin Dynasty.
During these times, significant struggles arise for many families who have names and numbers at stake in this battle.
Three Kingdoms is one of the periods of conflict in the history of Ancient China, where many thousands of people died in the wars that took place in the first century inside the 'grand palace' in Xi'an.
I have many things that come from 'society' and 'politics' like the use of the 'metric system'. and the change from 'absolutism' to 'republicanism', and the belief in 'nationalism' and love for the country is something for everyone and not just for one person who rules them.
And secondly, after the Revolution, work is open to everyone to let people have dreams and able to work hard to do good work that they want to do.
This is similar to the military because now they do not get ranks that follow the class of their family, but they will get ranks that follow their behavior and what they can do.
The French Revolution inspired many other 'working class' people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad is interested in things that are larger than life in this place. He often goes to a cave called "Hira'" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) where he stays and thinks.
This stone monument, which still exists, often provides clear evidence of Muhammad's beliefs.
It is located on top of a mountain near Mecca, this stone dome is high above the ground.
True, he is not easy to find and it knows if it is there. When you are inside this hole of stone, you are far away from everything else.
You cannot see another thing, just the sky which is clear, looks nice and is above and many mountains surround it. You cannot see or hear things from this land while you are inside this hole of stone.
The Great Pyramid in Giza is one of the 'seven wonders' that still stands today.
The people of Egypt built the Great Pyramid in the third century BCE, and it is one of the largest pyramid structures that they constructed to honor a Pharaoh who had passed away.
Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" inside the Valley of the Dead in Egypt has some pyramids (very large of all is the 'great pyramid'), some small 'tomb', some temples, and the 'great Sphinx'.
'The Great Pyramid was built to provide a resting place for Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members'
This "up bow mark" looks like a 'V' and this "down bow mark" looks like a 'staple' or a 'square' with no top side.
'Up' means you have to stand on your toes and place the bow, and 'down' means you have to stand on the frog (this is the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
One 'up-bow' is able to produce a sound that is softer, while one 'down-bow' is a sound that is stronger and has more force.
You have to make your marks with a pencil, but think about the "bowing marks" when you finish printing it has an ace and they are still there, so you must respect them.
On the 6th of October 1789, market women made King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two little children (Marie Therese who was 11 years old and Louis-Charles who was 4 years old), along with the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, return to Paris while they were staying in Versailles.
In one carriage, they run back to Paris while the big people fight and follow them to call and make different kinds of talk to praise the King and Queen.
The large group of people who are singing and dancing in order to greet the King and Queen have opened the church windows and are standing.
One time, a man among the powerful men pointed and showed the head of a 'royal guard' that they had killed in Versailles in France for the Queen and it looked very bad.
The U.S. is producing vaccines to help and obtain the Philippines even though many Filipinos are hesitant.
They convinced them to buy securities in the "colonial regime" of the U.S. to give money for the "expenditure" and "interest" on the "bonds" that they used in the name of the government of the Philippines inside the banks of Wall Street.
It is true that, much of the money which comes when or it damages the Filipino people, it will make the money of the U.S to dominate other parts of the world.
We must be careful in choosing the stories that make up this group.
This is the time when things became known as the High Middle Ages, this time in the history of Europe in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
Before the High Middle Ages, there was the Early Middle Ages, and after that there was the Late Middle Ages, this time ended around the year 1500.
'Technological determinism' is a concept that encompasses various ideas that people can practice, starting with the notion that the way people on Earth follow the laws of science and create technologies based on these laws.
Many of the thoughts on mining of 'technological determinism' have two main thoughts: one is that technological development follows a route where culture and politics cannot change, and the other is that technology imposes "change" on communities because these behaviors and thoughts are inherent and technology does not create them.
Example, we can say that the car is causing the men to build the roads.
However, a road that goes to every part of the country will waste money because there are some areas that are difficult, so the new roads to make cars become to downgrade the price of cars.
When many people have a car, many accidents can occur on the roads, this will cause the people to develop new techniques inside the healthcare system to treat injuries on the body.
Romanticism had a big part of the idea of 'cultural determinism' inside it, this idea came from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
From the side of Romanticism, a place where people come and express themselves in a unique way, and later, after some time customs and traditions that accompany the place where they are and are turned into, and these, will show what manner they are and it is the way of people in this place, this is much better than the lies where people get nothing in return and then use it.
In this era, Paris became the leading place for various clothing styles in this country today, but Constantinople remains the forefront city for various clothing styles during the middle ages in Europe.
Many people believe it because it is the birthplace of a good lifestyle and it started around 400 A.D and ended around 1100 A.D.
In the twelfth century, its value decreased because the Crusaders returned and brought new things like silk and spices. The value of these things is higher than the value of the things that are in the markets of Byzantium.
During this time, they received the name 'Fashion Capital' in the city of Constantinople and passed it on to the city of Paris.
The Gothic style became popular during the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
This dress follows the style of Byzantine silk fabric.
However, because the habit of sending messages has become more time-consuming, the Western styles will be out of fashion in 25 to 30 years.
When it reached the end of the Middle Ages, 'western' Europe began to develop its own styles. One of the major developments that occurred during this time was the use of crusades for people to use weapons to close clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is the type of agriculture where people grow food for their own family's consumption.
Subsistence agriculture is a system that does not use many things, does not use machines, uses a land where people get food that grows in this region, and they practice these ways along with the method of 'crop rotation' or other traditional techniques to make food plentiful.
Many farmers used to practice subsistence agriculture, and this practice is still common in many underdeveloped countries.
The 'subcultures' often give people similar thoughts and make them feel like they don't belong to society and when they come together they create their own 'identity'.
The 'subcultures' can be very different because of Christmas, where people come from, the levels of those inside the community, where they are in it, and their 'gender'.
The things that make up 'subcultures' are diverse, they can include language, customs, religion, politics, sexuality, location, or a combination of these things.
The members of a 'subculture' can show that they are part of it when they use a particular style, such as clothes they wear, the behavior they have, and the way they talk.
One of the methods that many people use to show 'socialization' is important is using stories of children who have been 'socialized' because parents do not want them, something bad happens in their lives, or people do bad things to them when they work in the garden.
This kind of children are often called "feral" or wild children. Some "feral" children are those who usually stay at home; sometimes parents do not care for these children because they have something wrong with their mind or body.
The 'feral' children have experienced a lot of damage or trauma in the past and this has affected their behavior or mindset.
The other 'feral' children are those that people say are animals in the bush, some say they are still in the bush.
When animals take care of these children, these "feral" children can display behaviors (and even habits) that resemble the behaviors of the animal that takes care of them, such as hunting or not knowing how to do something when in the company of other people.
Never mind, 'project based learning' involves changing something to become more and increase interest, 'scaffolding' creates more things.
'Scaffolding' is not a method of teaching something, but it is a way to provide support to individuals who are learning something new, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
The 'scaffold' can come from the computer or can actually be inside the classroom, another way of saying it is, a type is a 'scaffold', but a 'paperclip man' inside Microsoft Office is also a 'scaffold'.
The 'scaffolds' in the computer are inside the 'software' and their job is to ask questions, give instructions on what to do, and give clear directions on the steps to take to accomplish something that is difficult for them to do.
They put children in foster care because of various reasons and it can lead to neglect, abuse, and the practice of exploiting children to make money.
There should not be a child in an environment that is not good for them, does not care, and does not protect them, but they are still in such an environment.
We saw the Foster Care System as a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe places for children to stay, to love and care for them, and to provide good health care.
The 'foster care' is to provide everything that they did not have in the house where they got them from.
The internet can restrict people's ways of speaking to each other with various individuals or individuals with many others.
This internet behavior can provide new knowledge about how we can use the internet and obtain information.
Example, "learning" and "socialization" are important motivations that can make people want to use the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuing relationship" in Eighmey and McCord (1998) were identified as new things that enhance our use of the internet when studying people's behavior on websites.
The use of video recording has made it possible for investigators to detect important things on mining sites, such as "micro-expressions" - the very brief facial movements that can occur in a matter of milliseconds.
Big problem, they say that we can find out if a man or woman is lying when we search for their micro-expression during a stressful situation.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper "The President's Speech," shows how people cannot understand the fine details of conversation because they have some damage to their brains, but they can easily detect if a person is telling the truth.
He said that this kind of knowledge of men looking at the mining of the habits of men is also like the animals we can look after at home.
The researchers found that in the Twentieth century it revealed that there are two pools of genetic variation: one is hidden and one is out in the open.
'Mutation' can produce new 'genetic variation', and 'selection' can remove it from the 'pool' of 'expressed variation'.
'Segregation' and 'recombination' can cause this 'variation' to occur within each 'pool' in each 'generation'.
In the savannah, there is a hatred for one primate that has a digestive system similar to humans in processing amino acids from many plants.
And even worse, if they can't do this big things happen: 'growth depression', 'malnutrition', and true famine.
This plant, which is found in this place, contains proteins inside its leaves and stem, but it is harmful to the digestive systems of primates like us, so we must cut it down and cook it several times.
Another thing, animal food (ants, termites, and grubs) is essential for their diet, and it provides a large amount of protein that contains all the necessary amino acids that the body needs.
When we consider everything, we must be careful not to wrongly attribute the "protein problem" of the elders as being caused by a certain type of chimpanzees in the savanna.
'Sleep interruption' is the habit of waking up during sleep and returning to sleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This is something you can do when you use a "quiet alarm clock" to wake you up slowly and not startle you.
If you see that you have made a mistake in the name on your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the bed, this will make you get up and go to the office.
Another option of 'biorhythm-based' is to drink plenty of water (such as water or tea, a diuretic) before you sleep, this will wake you up to urinate.
The pain in a person's chest is only connected to the heaviness felt in the body and spirit of a person.
When the problem is small, there will be more positive ways of living. Everyone can work hard to find true happiness and peace.
Everyone can attain 'enlightenment'. It's just something that stands in the way of our thinking as our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism follows things that Buddha taught, but they make it more big with the 'mahayana path of love' and also with many techniques of Indian Yoga.
Inside his mind, Tibetan Buddhism is very important. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the concept of 'all-embracing love'.
With Kundalini Yoga, this Kundalini energy ('enlightenment energy') is raised within the 'yoga postures', breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The main thing in Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Inside the visualization of various gods, energy channels become clear, the chakras become active, and enlightenment of the mind occurs.
Germany was like a battlefield for many people during World War 2, this caused conflict between the USSR and USA. When the war ended, tension arose in the systems, processes, and culture, causing these countries to not get along.
Later, after two years in the end of the war, the countries that had worked together became enemies and the Cold War began.
This war will last for 40 years and real fighting will happen, in the armies that are attacking countries, in the war places in Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the defenses of Poland were broken, and the only thing left to do was to retreat and regroup at the bridgehead of Romania.
However, this plan has been disrupted tonight, with over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entering and creating a front in Belarus and a front in Ukraine, before moving inside and occupying the eastern region of Poland. This action violates the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements with both countries and others.
The way of using a ship to move things is the best way to move large amounts of cargo or people by sea.
The work of the 'navy' is to patrol and protect your country's borders and to also prevent illegal activities from crossing and entering your country.
A good example of this is the North Atlantic campaign during WWII. The Americans tried to move cargo and people across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
In the early days, the German navy used U-boats and tried to stop this from happening.
If the Allies do not do something they had done, Germany will surely surpass and get Britain as it had done in all of Europe.
The men started looking for fossils about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
The ancestors used to take care of the tribes by providing them with food, grass, meat, and animal skin.
The men who look after them usually put them in a group that roams the hills or other places to feed on grass, often they are led by goatherds and these are the big men who are called shepherds. These ways of looking after them are still used today.
The Wagonways were built in England in the 16th Century.
"Regardless of the 'wagonways' being the plan where they are located on the road, they are making holes to pull them out of the pit and pull big cargo off the road so it is not rougher on the road where they usually stay on this day."
They used the 'crossties' to hold this 'track' in place at one location. Later, now, they know that this 'track' will become even better if there is one part on top of them.
This habit is something that many people do, but it causes wear on the wheel of the wagon.
Later, they replaced the wooden planks with iron rails. In 1767, they made the first 'full-iron rails'.
The number one 'transportation' is walking, people started walking about two million years ago when Homo Erectus (which means 'upright man') appeared.
The people are following, the Australopithecus did not walk on two legs all the time.
The way of walking on two legs they found in the fossil of Australopithecus that lived 4.2-3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus walked on two legs in a different time like seven million years ago.
We can start by staying in good shape with the environment, we can join an environmental movement, and we can become activists in fighting the weight of the problems that may arise in the future.
Many times this is usually like 'symptomatic treatment'. However, if we do not want a temporary answer, okay we must find the cause of the problem, and we must stop them.
He is concerned because the earth is changing a lot due to new knowledge of science and technology, and problems are arising because many people and their lifestyles are having all kinds of big things.
After Congress had gotten this paper on July 4, a copy that they had written by hand and which was signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to a printing shop owned by John Dunlop that was nearby.
In the night, they make a type like 150 to 200 copies, now they call it "Dunlap broadsides".
The first time they published this document in public was when John Nixon wrote it outside Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he replied to his soldiers in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
25-pela Dunlop broadies, everyone is still waiting and they are very anxious about this document. This document which they wrote by hand is damaged.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs still exists today. We call them birds.
Many people do not realize that they are like birds because they have 'feathers' and can fly.
But there are many things in people that look the same as they did before.
They have legs with 'scales' and 'claws', they can lay eggs and walk on both legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers that are used today can send information that is stored in the 'code' of binary numbers.
A 'binary number' can have two values, which are 0 or 1, and these numbers are commonly referred to as 'binary digits' or 'bits' in computer language.
'Internal poisoning' cannot be diagnosed by physical appearance alone. It is a type of illness that requires a professional diagnosis.
"The first thing that shows as 'internal poisoning' is the arrival of a container of medicine or toxic chemicals at the house."
Make a label for the first aid instructions for this potion.
This word 'bug' is used by entomologists to refer to this group of insects.
This word is derived from the mining of bed bugs, these are insects that are parasitic to humans.
The Assassin bugs and Bed bugs are 'nidicolous', they can be found in places where they are born or something that provides them with food.
In terms of food in the United States of America, there are around 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the number one neurological disease in many people.
MS is a disease that can occur in the central nervous system, this system includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that the genes of women are twice as likely to get multiple sclerosis as those of men.
A married person can decide that they are not good for each other, they are not good for their children, if they have a baby.
These kinds of marriages can lead to the decision to give their babies up for adoption.
In one 'adoption', the biological parents who give birth to this child will give up their rights as parents and other married couples can look after this child.
The science of thinking is about finding out how this earth works when using scientific methods. This method can support many scientific research.
It is not yet established, 'experimentation', and one 'experiment' is a 'test' used to eliminate or confirm one or more of the ideas that have been developed, the method of asking questions, and conducting studies can also provide support for 'scientific research'.
People study nature and philosophy by looking at classical texts, like the Bible in the Latin language.
The things that people say are okay in their thinking are Aristotle's thoughts in science, along with psychology.
When the knowledge of the Greeks declined, the West abandoned the thoughts of the Greeks in science and philosophy.
Many scientists believe that they see 'rhythms' that come from the body and the behavior of animals and human beings can follow the 'cycles' of things that are outside the body and the 'biological clock' of the body.
The 'periodic rhythms' do not occur simply because of things outside, but researchers have studied and found that it is related to many living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The 'biological clock' is something that can maintain itself and become 'electric currents' and they continue to run even when things outside that make them run are not present.
Hershey and Chase's experiment is one of the things that says DNA is a 'genetic material'.
Hershey and Chase used 'phages', or viruses, to introduce their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments where they marked DNA inside a phage with radioactive phosphorus or marked the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
The 'mutations' can create new things and they can arise because of different types of 'mutations', an important work of this process is 'genetic material', and if these are the 'germ-line cells'.
The mutations that occur in germ-line cells can be passed on to offspring, but mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
'Nature-based tourism' is the practice of attracting people who are interested in seeing natural areas and enjoying the scenery, along with the plants and animals of those areas.
Example of 'on-site activity' includes finding fish, taking photos, observing birds, and exploring the park and learning about the ecosystem.
One example is to take a photo and get information about the 'orangutans' when you go to Borneo.
Good morning. People often leave their small country towns when they go to work in other people's villages and leave the place they left behind just now and come back.
In this 'transport shuttle' everyone is connected, and they support a 'transport system' where 'private cars' are involved.
Now science has shown that this new 'carbon economy' is disrupting the 'biosphere' in a 'stable state' that has supported people for the past two million years.
All people are living inside the society and using the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you may not be able to hear complaints about the water quality when the taps run dry.
Why do the transportation systems produce these kinds of problems, why can't they work properly every day? Can't the transportation engineers do their job? Oh, is there something bigger happening?
'Traffic Flow' is the study of the movement of each driver and vehicle at two points and what kind of things they can do to another.
However, the study of 'traffic flow' is difficult because the driving behavior of one person cannot predict what will happen in a population of one hundred percent.
However, drivers usually follow a consistent pattern, so the traffic usually has some consistency and this confuses women who can count on mathematics.
In order to make 'traffic flow' better, the licenses must be directly linked to three major elements: (1) 'flow', (2) 'density', and (3) 'velocity'.
This license can assist with planning, designing, and operation of roadway facilities.
The insects are the number one animals found in the forest. This way of flying helps them to avoid their enemies and find food and mates easily.
Many insects can fold their wings to fit against their bodies and this is a good thing.
This makes them have many small places of hiding for animals who want to eat them.
Today, insects that cannot fold their wings are "dragon flies" and "mayflies."
Some thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Many people think that they are right, but many people believe the opposite; they think that the Solar System revolves around Earth, with the Sun (and other planets too).
This looks like it is true, because we cannot feel that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest river on Earth. It carries water which is 8 times more than the second largest river.
Second, the Amazon River is the largest river by volume on Earth, and the length of its name is six miles.
20 percent of the water that comes from the planet's water comes from the Amazon.
The big Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from many thousands of small rivers.
Never mind the methods of building pyramids in stone, they continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, not giving in to the doubts and efforts of people who made the pyramids of Giza.
The people of Egypt of the New Kingdom thought that these buildings of their ancestors were truly remarkable, at this time these 'pyramids' have more than a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. This is the smallest country in the world and a country with a very small population indeed.
Vatican City uses the Italian language for its official communications.
Italian people use their language in the state and also use it to communicate every day and they use Latin for religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
The people used to know about the large chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper in the past because they used to find them in their natural environment and it was easy to find them with the tools from the past.
Aristotle, a philosopher, developed the idea that everything comes from a single or a combination of a few basic elements. These elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This is like the other 'states of matter' (and following that): solid, liquid, gas, and 'plasma', they also say they change and make new things to make the things we see.
They are mixing things that contain two or more metals inside. Don't think that there are many elements inside the periodic table.
The elements such as 'calcium' and 'potassium' are viewed as metals. There are other metals too such as silver and gold.
You can have all the 'alloy' that have small marks of the elements that are not metal like 'carbon' inside them.
Everything inside the Universe comes from 'matter'. All 'matter' is made up of tiny things inside them called 'atoms'.
The atoms are very small and their trillion of them can fit into a single full stop at the end of a sentence.
That's right, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it first came out.
However, when the new right way becomes available, the pencil took a backseat and is not used much.
Now people can write words on the computer screen, and they don't need to get close to a sharpener.
We can think about what will come out on the keyboard when something new comes in.
Fission bomb works by taking energy and forming a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Just like you work to push a heavy object up a small mountain. The process of 'splitting nucleus' can release some of this energy.
Some 'atoms' have 'unstable nuclei' and this means they can break when you handle them, whether you handle them gently or not.
The top layer of the Moon has stones and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called 'crust'.
The crust is about 70 km thick on one side and 100 km thick on the other side.
It is 'thin' in the lowlands and 'thick' in the highlands.
It looks like there will be more 'maria' on the site nearby because the 'crust' is thinner. It is also easier to come up on the outside.
The 'content theories' look at how things can affect people's mental state and carry their beliefs and thoughts.
This 'theory' suggests that people have some things they need and desire which are ingrained in them from the time they become adults.
This 'theory' often looks at what things inside some people do that make them like certain things that they do and what things inside the environment will do and they will make something or not make something.
Two 'content theories' that many people are familiar with are the Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
If we think about everything, two ways come to mind right away when managers start going against their fellow colleagues. On one side, they want to stay as a "group's only boy" (girl in the group).
This kind of manager always looks for ways to make decisions that people don't like, giving them a hard time, criticizing the performance of the workers, giving them work, and speaking harshly to the workers as if they are wrong.
In another site, a manager is being sent to become a man or woman that the people trust and think that they must do everything that they are supposed to do and do everything from the strength of their own.
After everything, it is the leader's responsibility to ensure that work is done well or not done well.
This behavior can cause trouble for others and for yourself.
People who are familiar with working with computers have various standard tools to make work easier, just like people who are familiar with working in an office, but there are some small differences.
People who work with computers can work as men or women who can collaborate with groups working in offices.
They can do something in their leisure time when they can work inside the office while hanging out with other team members during times when they are comfortable in different time zones and this is something the local manager cannot clear up.
One significant "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is a hidden thing that exists during times when working with computers.
This "invisible team" is a management team where each team member reports to it. This "invisible team" can influence the performance of each team member.
Why would an organization want to do work that takes a lot of time? This is the work of creating an organization that can teach something. One of the thoughts behind creating 'organizational learning' is the way of 'innovation' inside the organization.
When departments of an organization use all resources well, 'creativity' and 'ingenuity' can emerge.
Because of this, the process of organizing work and reducing a large amount of something can lead to new or different processes of meeting customer needs.
In the past in one organization, there can be new and different ways of doing things, leaders must create a framework for creating new and different things and also, there must be a way to pass on knowledge and teach things together.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations improve their performance.
The neurobiological information provides evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. This makes the area of research more precise and exact.
Brain pathology research and practices support scientists in their research.
They know that over time different types of damage can occur in the brain, such as trauma, lesion, and tumor, which can cause changes in thinking.
This new technology helps us to look at and investigate the structures and processes of the brain that we have not seen before.
This provides us with new information and material to develop simulation models that can help us better understand the processes that occur within our thinking.
Regardless of what people think of 'science fiction', AI has created an important area within 'computer science', it can work on the site of a custom, teach something, make sense inside a machine.
Research within AI is the work of creating machines that can do all work that can be done anytime and need the knowledge of one work to make decisions.
Example is controlling something, filling in and marking the time of something, knowing the answers to customer questions, and looking at handwriting, voice and face.
This type of things has different areas of research, and it looks at different ways to provide answers to problems that occur every day.
Now they use this AI system in the areas of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, and they used it to build some computer programs for home and video game software applications.
The 'field trip' is an important part of the classroom. Many times teachers like to take their students to places where they cannot reach by bus and walk.
Technology provides an opportunity to experience a "field trip" that comes from the computer. Things can be looked at "museum artifact", visit an "aquarium", look at some nice "art" while they are standing in class.
The method of conducting a 'field trip' on a computer is also a good way to explore a place and present things that happened with the class during break time.
For example, every year the students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website for their outdoor trip to the State Capital, and each year this website gets a new style, but all the old versions are still online like a scrapebook.
The blogs can receive assistance with writing well. Often, the writing begins with grammar and spelling that is not good, and when there is help, they will correct and write better.
Because the politicians often make a lot of speeches if something is not right, this activity of blogging will start to correct the speeches that are said to not be right.
At the same time, 'blogging' "has the potential to change opinions in some matters that are happening in the community where they are situated." This need to express themselves in blogs makes some things more known and becomes 'interesting' (Toto, 2004).
'Blogging' is a tool that people can use to work together and enhance their understanding of something they are learning about more inside the school.
Use blogs for good and honest purposes, to create something that can assess something or know something about what is not right and what is right; when working with materials on the Internet, things can be known about what makes them stay and when assessing something that others write and then they can give their thoughts on things that are happening.
Ottawa is the capital of Canada where people use two languages and it has all the 'art galleries' and 'museums' that showcase the past and present time of Canada.
. Near the south is Niagara Falls and to the north is Muskoka, a place that looks nice and has many other places nearby.
People outside often say that all of this and some more shows Ontario as the true home of Canada's famous fish.
The large areas far from the coast do not have many people, and some places have no people at all.
One thing to consider in the population increase that makes a lot of people become disgruntled: There are more African Americans in the US than all citizens of Canada.
Eastern African Islanders are located in the Indian Ocean outside the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is a really big island, and it is like its own continent when we look at the 'wildlife' site.
Many of the small islands are independent countries, or they are regarded as part of France, and they are seen as luxury beach resorts.
And also, the Arabs brought Islam to this place, and it became the dominant religion in Comoros and Mayotte.
The ways and thoughts of the people in Europe and the concept of 'colonialism' started in the 15th century, when the explorer from Portugal Vasco de Gama found the Cape Route while in Europe and went to India.
In the north of the line is the Sahel, and in the east is the Atlantic Ocean.
The women: It is good that they only go to places they must say they are married, even if they are not really married.
He is happy to wear a ring (not wear a ring that looks expensive).
The women should be careful because the actions of other men can lead to something they perceive as harassment and often times men can intimidate you, hold your hand and touch you inappropriately.
You must be strong and not be influenced by others, don't pretend to stand strong and talk (the way of doing things here, it's not okay for them to act that way!).
The city of Casablanca today is the Berber people who have been producing fish since the 10th century BCE, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenid people use it as an important port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and built it again under the name Casa Branca, but they left this place after a big earthquake happened in 1755.
The 'sultan' of Morocco built this city as Daru l-Badya and traders from Spain called it Casablanca when they made it their center of operations.
In all the places of Casablanca, it is one of the places where there is not a good place to buy things.
In the medina, people are busy looking for places that sell Moroccan goods, such as 'tagine', 'pottery', 'leather goods', 'hookahs', and various trinkets, but all of these things are for tourists to buy.
Goma is a city where tourists like to visit inside the Democratic Republic of Congo near the border with the country Rwanda.
In 2002, a massive eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and displaced many of its residents, causing widespread devastation to the town.
Maski Goma is a small safe, tourists who go to visit places outside of Goma must be careful and be aware of what kind of danger may arise in North Kivu province.
This site is the place for staying in and claiming the Nyiragongo volcano with the people seeking mountain gorillas. The praise of these people seeking gorillas is more than the others inside Africa.
You can use a motorcycle taxi outside Goma. The local price for this is about 500 Congolese Francs at any stop.
Another thing is that "Timbuktu" is famous for people to use this name as a metaphor for something that is far away.
