This not only confirms the widely held theory that some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides additional details that general fossilization cannot. For example, color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the fur of this animal has a brown color like the top of a durian and has a pale or carotene-like color on the bottom.
The discovery about the above-mentioned matter also sheds light on the evolution of birds in depth.
Since the dinosaur feathers do not have well-developed rachis, but have other properties of bird feathers such as down feathers and barbicels, researchers concluded that the development of rachis may have occurred later after these other properties.
The structure of feathers shows that these feathers are not designed for flight, but for controlling temperature or just for beauty much more. Researchers pointed out that even though these are the tail feathers of young dinosaurs, the example shows that they are feathers of fully grown birds, not chick feathers.

We can shape gold into various forms and can also press it into small sizes.
Gold can be drawn into very thin wires, twisted and woven into patterns, and also hammered or pressed into sheets.
That gold can be made into thin, sharp sheets and applied onto other metals. It can be made very thin to the extent that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books, which are called "manuscript illuminations."
This is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You can create an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage water changes color according to the acidity or alkalinity level of the chemical substance.
pH value will be determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H+ in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are proteins that attract electrons out (because the hydrogen atom consists of one protein and one electron).

When you call someone who is far away by thousands of miles, it means you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space will receive the signal and reflect it back almost immediately.
Satellites are launched into space using rockets. Scientists need to use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere causes light to refract and distort the view of some of us.
We need a rocket at least 100 feet tall to launch satellites or telescopes into space.
The wheel has changed the world in ways we never imagined. The greatest thing the wheel does for us is to make transportation more convenient and faster.

After that, there are medium-sized carnivores such as tigers and lions, which prey on medium-sized animals from rabbits to deer and wild boars.
In the end, there are very small cats (including stray cats) that eat various small prey such as insects, rodents, reptiles like geckos, and birds.
The key to their success is the philosophy of life and behavior, which is considered a special task that each cat adheres to in order to prevent them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social cats that live in large groups called prides.
The lion pride consists of one to three full-grown male lions, as well as female lions and up to 30 lion cubs.
Due to being a large family consisting of older sisters and daughters, females tend to have close relationships with each other.
Lion behavior is similar to that of wild dogs or wolves, which are living things that are surprisingly similar to lions (but much less like other large cat species) and are also dangerous predators to their prey alike.
The crocodile is an athlete who is well-organized, has the ability to climb mountains (but not really good at) swimming, long jumping, and pulling with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group as the lion, leopard, and jaguar (genus Panthera). All four of these types of cats are the only animals capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is different from the full-throated roar of the lion, but it is more like a threatening growl than a roar.
Wildcats love to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds. Almost all of the animals that wildcats hunt are smaller in size than themselves.
Scientists believe that wild cats track and hunt for animals (prey) by sniffing out the scent of where the prey has been on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with their night vision capability and move stealthily to ambush their prey in the surroundings, then pounce on the prey.
When small groups of living things (small populations) are separated from the main population (such as when they move to live on mountains or in rivers, or if they move to new islands so that they cannot easily return to their original location), these living things are often found in a different environment than before.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population must have different qualifications or the ability to adapt to become stronger competitors than before.
The original population has not changed much. They still need to adjust in the same way as before.
As time goes by, as new residents start to adjust to their new environment, they will gradually look less and less different from other residents.
After passing hundreds of thousands or even millions of years, the populations of both groups eventually appeared so different that they cannot be called the same type of living beings anymore.
We call this process the new species emergence process, which means the creation of new species. The process of creating new species is unavoidable and considered an important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans use for breathing and take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (which is the process of breathing out).
Plants produce food from sunlight through photosynthesis and also provide shade.
We use plants to build houses and turn them into clothes and food that we eat, mostly plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mozasaurus is the ultimate predator of the era, so it fears nothing but other Mozasaurus.
Its long jaws are full of sharp teeth, more than 70 in total, along with special teeth on the roof of the mouth, meaning nothing that enters will be able to escape.
We are not certain, but it may have a forked tongue. Its diet includes turtles, large fish, other amphibians, and it may have been a predator of similar animals in the past.
It still attacks anything that enters the water, even giant predators like T-Rex are no match for it.
Although the majority of Roman food is familiar to us, the Romans themselves also have strange or exotic dishes for banquets, such as wild boar, quail, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women eat while sitting in a chair, the wealthy prefer to eat extravagantly together, sitting cross-legged on the side while enjoying their meal.
It is not possible to count the amount of food that came from America or Asia that entered Europe several centuries later as ancient Roman food.
For example, ancient Romans did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or even chocolate, and there were no ancient Romans who had ever tasted the taste of chicken wings.
The Babilonians built the main temples that they considered as homes for each deity.
People will bring offerings to the gods, and the monks will try to follow the wishes of the gods through various ceremonies and festivals.
Each pagoda has an open courtyard, and then there is an inner sanctum that only monks can enter.
Sometimes there is a special pyramid-shaped pagoda called "Sikakurat" built as part of a temple.

Even though he may have been the discoverer, the Eskimo tribe already lived there at that time.
Even though each country may be a "Scandinavia," the people, culture, traditions and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland are very different from each other.
If you have ever watched the movie "Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation", you might think that the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although some things are written on the back of the document, it is not a map to hidden treasure.
The text written on the back of the Declaration of Independence is the phrase "The original Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776," with the text appearing at the bottom of the document when turned upside down.
Although no one knows for certain who the author is, we do know that in the early stages of life, this large animal skin document (measuring 29¾ inches × 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is possible that there has been an addition of notes to the label format.
The elevation of Pol up to Normandy and the subsequent battles released the northern part of France to be free. However, the southern part still does not receive freedom.

On 15th August 1940, the allied forces invaded the southern region of France. This invasion was known as "Operation Dragoon".
The American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany in just two weeks.
Culture is a shared culture practiced by a large group of people who live and work together in society.
The word "civilization" comes from the word "civilis" in Latin, which means citizen, is related to the word "civis" in Latin, which means citizen, and the word "civitas" which means city or state, and also defines the size of a society.
Bangkok is a symbol of the nation, a thriving culture that reflects the transmission of knowledge through generations, the traces of culture that still remain, and the expansion of equality.
Subcultures often disappear without leaving any historical evidence and are not recognized as appropriate cultural practices.
During the revolutionary war, the thirteen states established a provisional central government under the Articles of Confederation, with a unicameral Congress.
The Congress has no power to levy taxes and since there is no national or regional administration, it must rely on state agencies, which often do not cooperate in enforcing the actions of the congress.
The legislature also has no power to overturn tax laws and customs duties rates between different states.
The law must receive unanimous approval from every state before it can be amended, and the states do not pay much attention to the central government. Even the representatives of each state do not often participate.
The national football team of Italy, as well as the national football team of Germany, is considered to be the second most successful team in the world, and these two teams were also crowned as the FIFA World Cup champions in the year 2006.
The popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
In the northern region, winter sports are the most popular, with Italians participating in international games and the Olympics.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest island), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the fact that Japan is full of groups or clusters of islands, Japan is often referred to by its geographical characteristic as "archipelago".
Taiwan has been inhabited since the 15th century, when European sailors passing through the area recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southern Taiwan, starting to change traditional methods of crop production and hiring Chinese laborers to work in rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty's army gained control over the western coastal areas and the northern territories of Taiwan, and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the victory in the Sino-Japanese War I (BE 2437-2438), in the year BE 2438, the Ching government signed the Shimoseki Treaty to transfer sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, allowing Japan to govern the island until BE 2488.
The Chupicchu, the ancient archeological site of the Inca people, consists of three main structures, including the Intihuatana stone, the temple of the sun, and the room with three windows.
The main buildings in the area have been newly constructed to give tourists the opportunity to see how things used to be.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored and the restoration work is still ongoing until today.
For example, the most common format for still photography in the world is 35mm, which played a crucial role in the final days of the analog film era.
Currently, this type of film is still being produced, but the more important issue is the ratio of image transferred from the digital camera's image sensor format.
In fact, the 35mm format, which is 33mm wide and 24mm high, can be confusing.
The proportion of this form (divided by 12 to become the simplest ratio) is called 3:2.
There are several general patterns (e.g. patterns in the APS genus) that have approximately the same or similar value as the aspect ratio of this image.
The three-part rule that is often mocked and ridiculed is the simple guideline for creating a dynamic while maintaining a balanced composition.
The position that has the highest efficiency for the main object is at the point of intersection of the line dividing the image into three parts both vertically and horizontally. (see example)
In the history of Europe during this period, there was a detailed examination of the powerful and influential Catholic Church.
It has been over a thousand years since Christianity has connected various states in Europe together, even though their languages and customs may differ.
The expansion of power has an impact on every social class, from the king to the common people.
One important principle of Christianity is to use wealth to alleviate suffering and aid the poor, and the financial resources of the Christian church are specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the Christian church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and the accumulation of power and money has made many people wonder if this religious belief has been practiced or not.
Not long after the Pacific War broke out, England also blocked Germany's sea communication lines.
It has been proven that the aforementioned strategy is effective in causing disruption to important military and civilian personnel, even though such encirclement violates international law, which is generally accepted, as compiled by various international agreements over the past two decades.
Barbed wire is placed in international water to prevent ships from entering various parts of the ocean, making it dangerous even for medium-sized ships.

He arrived in the United States with only 4 cents in his pocket, a poetry book, and a recommendation letter from Charles Bettcher (his previous manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had unique ways of displaying different special periods of time, divided into dynasties or various ruling powers with distinctive characteristics.
During the period of each dynasty, it was a time when provinces were separated and unstable. The most well-known period is the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
There were many fierce wars between lords and ladies fighting to claim the throne during this time.
The Three Kingdoms period was the bloodiest era in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in battles to seize the throne in the imperial palace of Xi'an.
The impact on society and politics is extensive, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from an absolute monarchy to a democratic republic, nationalistic sentiments, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not just the ruling elite.
After the revolution, various occupations have also opened up for all male applicants, providing opportunities for those who are adventurous and successful to achieve the most success.

In addition, the French Revolution also inspired the working class, who were oppressed in other countries, to start their own revolution.
Muhammed has a great interest in matters beyond ordinary everyday life. He often goes to the cave known as "Hira" on Mount Nur (light) to meditate.
The survived cave body signifies a clear picture of the inclination towards spirituality.
This cave is situated on a mountaintop in the northern part of Bangkok and isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy at all to find it even if you know for sure that it exists. When you go into the cave, it's like cutting off from the outside world completely.
Apart from the clear and beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains, there is almost nothing else to see or hear from this world when inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders of the world that still remains standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the ancient Egyptians in the third millennium BC, is one of the many large pyramid structures built to honor the pharaohs.
The Great Pyramid of Giza, or "Great Tomb of Giza" in the mountain of death of the Egyptians, consists of various pyramids (where the Great Pyramid is the largest pyramid), numerous small tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The large pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wife and family members.

King Louis XVI, the terrified king, Her Majesty Queen Marie Antoinette, the prince and princess of both (Marie Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old), and Madame Elisabeth, the king's sister, were forced by the market women to leave Versailles and return to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a horse-drawn carriage surrounded by a crowd that jeered and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd pushed the king and queen to open the carriage window throughout the procession.
During one period, one of the soldiers guarding the queen was assassinated by a terrorist group in front of the frightened queen.
The Filipino people themselves must bear the cost of waging the war to conquer the Philippines for the American colonial empire.
They are required to pay taxes to the government of the United States to cover most expenses and interest on government bonds held by the Philippines government through banks on Wall Street.
Sure, here is the translated sentence: "Certainly, the high level of profit coming from seeking long-term benefits for the people of the Philippines is considered a fundamental benefit of the American imperialism."
In order to understand the Thermoplastic Elastomer, we need to understand the context that led to the establishment of this community.
The era in which this event occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, which is the period of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300) in European history.
During the Renaissance period, it was a transitional period from the early to the late Renaissance, which generally considered to end around the year 1500.
Setting the direction of technology is a term that encompasses diverse perspectives that are put into practice, ranging from the promotion of technology or the necessity of technology to the direct meaning that human destiny is driven by basic principles related to the laws of science and the expression in the form of technology.
Mostly, the interpretation of technological determinism has two common ideas, which are that technology develops according to the path that is above the influence of culture or politics, and that technology has "impacts" on the existing society rather than being shaped by social conditions.
For example, we could say that cars contribute to the development of roads by making it unavoidable.
However, the nationwide road network will not be economically viable if there are only a few cars in use. Therefore, there have been new methods of production developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
In addition, the high number of car owners also leads to an increase in road accidents, which has led to the development of new techniques for repairing damaged car bodies.
. Culture shapes the majority of beliefs and values, as seen in the works of many writers such as Goethe, Nietzsche, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shapes individuals and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerge. These are more suitable for the society's place than laws that are arbitrarily established without criteria.
Copenhagen is considered the fashion capital of Europe in the same way Paris is renowned as the fashion capital of the world in contemporary times.
The vocabulary for being the center of sophistication started around the Christian era 400 and continued until around the Christian era 1100.
: During the 12th century, this place experienced a decrease in status mainly due to a group of warrior monks returning valuable items such as silk and spices, which had higher value than what the market of Byzantine offered.
At that time, there was a change in the position of the fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most popular in the 10th to 11th centuries and the 14th century.
During the initial period, fashion was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, slow communication channels make Western-style styles delayed by 25 to 30 years.
When entering the late Middle Ages, Western Europeans began to develop their own style. One of the most significant developments at that time was the use of buttons to fasten clothing by the Crusaders.
Agriculture for livelihood is agriculture carried out to produce enough food for the needs of farmers and their families.
Agriculture for livelihood is a simple system that often involves organic farming using seeds that grow in agro-ecological zones, combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase productivity.
According to history, the majority of farmers work in agriculture for their livelihood and it remains the same in many developing countries.
Culture brings together individuals with similar thinking characteristics, who feel neglected by societal standards, and helps them develop their self-identity.
Cultural subcultures may differ significantly due to age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The various qualifications that define a subculture are clearly distinct and may include linguistics, mathematics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or many other factors combined.
Members of subcultures often express their membership through the use of distinctive styles, such as fashion, gestures, and specialized vocabulary.
One of the most commonly used methods to demonstrate the importance of social polishing is to take advantage of the cases of unfortunate children who have been abandoned, unfortunate victims of abuse, and those who have not been nurtured by adults while growing up.
Children of this type are called "wild kids" or feral. Some wild children are being confined by their own people (often their parents). In some cases, the abandonment of a child occurs due to the parents' inability to care for the child intellectually or physically.
Children in the wild may have experienced severe abuse in their youth or have emotional scars before being abandoned or fleeing.
Other people are mentioned as being raised by animals. Some say they live in the forest on their own.
When fully nurtured by non-human animals, children in a wild-like state will exhibit behaviors (within physical limitations) almost entirely like those of the caretaker animals, such as being fearful or indifferent to humans.
Even though learning through projects may make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding teaching can do even more.
Scavenging is not a way of learning, but rather serves as a support tool for individuals who are learning new things, such as using new computer programs or starting new projects.
Sculptures can be both realistic and abstract, such as a teacher being one form of sculpture, but a paperclip in Microsoft Office is also a sculpture.
Virtual Scaffolds are integrated into the software itself and are designed to prompt, stimulate, and explain the steps that students may find difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed with foster families for a variety of reasons, including abandonment, abuse, or even threats of harm.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where they are not nurtured, cared for, and given knowledge, but they still grow up in that environment.
We understand that the foster care system provides a safe environment for these children.
Our family support system should provide a safe home, caretakers who show love, stable education, and reliable health care.
The comprehensive care should include preparing all the necessary items that were lacking in the household where the child used to live before being taken in.
The internet comprises both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to various dimensions, adding further in terms of usage and methods of creating satisfaction.
Examples such as "learning" and "socializing" are considered important motivators for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
When they examined the reactions of viewers towards the Eighmey and McCord (1998) website, they also pointed out that "personal involvement" and "long-term relationships" are new motivating factors.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries regarding the interpretation of facial expressions in milliseconds, which are subtle movements of the face in just a few milliseconds.
Especially with the claim that one can tell if a person is lying or not by interpreting subtle facial expressions correctly
Oliver Sacks stated in his research called "The President's Speech" that how can someone who cannot understand speech due to a brain injury be able to assess the sincerity.
He pointed out repeatedly that there may be some types of animals, such as pet dogs, that have various abilities mentioned to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century indicates that there have been changes in all genetic groups, including those that do not manifest and those that do manifest.
The process of breeding has increased genetic diversity and the selection process has removed those from the diverse group that are shown to be unsuitable.
The process of separating and recombining themselves constantly changes forms between the two generations.
. In the grassy fields of the savanna, animals that nurse their young with a digestive system like humans find it difficult to meet their acidic amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
In addition, not being able to do so could also lead to severe consequences such as stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest accessible plant resources may be the protein accessible in leaves and leguminous plants, but as primates, we find it difficult to digest these unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) not only easy to digest but also provide high levels of essential amino acids and protein.
When considering everything, it's not surprising if our ancestors also addressed the "protein problem" in a manner similar to what Chimpanzees currently do in the grassy savannah.
The process of waking up on purpose during your regular sleep time, and going back to sleep shortly after (10-60 minutes), is called a sleep interruption.
You can easily do this by using a quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up.
If you usually tend to snooze the alarm clock during sleep, you can put the clock far away on the other side of the room so that you have to get up from bed to turn it off.
Other options that are based on circadian rhythms include consuming large amounts of liquid (especially water or tea known to be diuretics) before bedtime, which will require getting up to urinate.
The level of inner peace within a person can fluctuate with the level of stress in their body and mind.
The less stressed you are, the more positive life force you will have. Everyone has the potential to find true peace, happiness, and true satisfaction.
Everyone can realize that the only thing that is an obstacle to this goal is stress and negative view of the world.
Buddhism in Tibet has its roots in the teachings of Buddha, but has incorporated many Mahayana doctrines and numerous tantric techniques from India.
In principle, Buddhism in Tibet is very simple, consisting of the three trainings, the practice of meditation, and the path of embracing universal love.
Gundalini Yoga awakens the energy of kundalini (the energy of consciousness) through yoga, breathing exercises, meditation, and visualization.
The center of practicing Tibetan meditation is the yoga deity. Energy pathways will be cleansed, the mind will function, and awareness will arise through visualizing various deities.
Germany was the common enemy of the Soviet Union and the United States in World War II, which led to cooperation between the two countries. When the war ended, conflicts in terms of systems, processes, and cultures caused countries to be affected and impacted each other.
Two years after the war ended, former allies turned into enemies and then the cold war began.
It will probably be there for another 40 years, and there will be real fighting by the representative army in various battlefields, from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, Poland's defense force was defeated, and the only hope was to retreat and establish a new system along the lines of the Romanian bridgehead.
Be that as it may, just overnight, these plans became outdated when over 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered to build the Belarussian and Ukrainian defensive lines after the invasion of the eastern borderlands of Poland, violating the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, which prohibited aggression between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
Using boats for transporting goods is considered the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across the ocean.
Formerly, the work of the navy was to take care of the country so that it could maintain the ability to move people and goods, as well as to obstruct the ability to move people and goods of the enemy.
One notable example is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which Americans attempted to move troops and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid England.
At the same time, the German navy, which primarily uses U-boats, also attempted to halt this transportation.
If the alliance fails, Germany might be able to conquer England, as they have successfully taken over the remaining parts of Europe.
It seems that there was goat domestication for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
The culture and ancient tribes started to domesticate them in order to access milk, hair, meat, and skin easily.
Generally, goats are usually raised in herds that roam the hills or other pastures similar to the way sheep are raised, and goat herders are often children or teenagers. This method of herding animals is still used today.
The canal was built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the railway only has a pair of parallel rails, it allows the carriage to accelerate and pull heavier loads than on rough and bumpy roads at that time.
Pillows are used to start squeezing the rails to fit relatively quickly. However, it was later realized that the rails would be more efficient if there is steel on top.
This has become a common practice, but the steel causes more damage to the wooden wheels of the carriage than before.
Finally, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels, and in the year 1767, iron rails were used for the first time.
The first method of transportation that humans know is walking. Humans started walking upright about 2 million years ago, along with the emergence of Homo Erectus.
Austria's alpithex, which is their leading man, does not walk straight as usual, characteristically.
There have been findings of animals walking on two legs expertly in the fossilized deposits from 4.2-3.9 million years ago. However, Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way by actively participating in environmental movements and even becoming environmental activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is similar to treating symptoms in many cases. However, if we do not just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
It is clear that the world has changed significantly due to the advancements in science and technology of human society, and the problems have also increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human society.
After being approved by the Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft signed by John Hancock, the President of Congress, and Charles Thompson, the Secretary of Congress, was sent to John Dunlap's printing press, located just a few buildings away.
Throughout the night, approximately 150 to 200 copies were made, which is now known as the "Dunlap broadside".
John Nicholson read this document publicly for the first time at the Independence Hall on July 8th.
There was a copy sent to George Washington on July 6th, which he read to the New York forces on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 remaining declarations of independence are the oldest copies of this surviving document. The original handwritten version no longer exists.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still exist today. We call these surviving dinosaurs birds.
Many people do not think that they are dinosaurs because they have fur and can fly.
But birds have many features that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws. They lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a T-rex.
Almost every computer currently in use relies on data management that is written in code in binary format.
Base 2 can only have two values, which are 0 or 1, and these numbers are called base 2 or bits in computer language.
The poison may not immediately manifest in various symptoms such as vomiting, which is a common symptom that cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The best indicator of poisoning is the presence of open containers of medications or toxic household chemicals that may have been ingested.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists officially call this group of insects as Coleoptera
This word comes from being familiar with bedbugs since ancient times, which are insects that can adapt well to living on the human body.
Both the pangolin and the turtle are animals that are unable to help themselves when they are born. They have to adapt to living in a burrow or the habitat provided by their caretaker.
Throughout the United States, there are about 400,000 people affected by multiple sclerosis (MS), making it one of the leading countries in neurological disorders among adolescents and middle-aged individuals.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research studies have found that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis (MS) or nerve inflammation and hardening.
The husband and wife decided that taking care of a delinquent child is not something they want or something their child needs.
The husband and wife couple may choose to have children by planning to raise virtuous children.
The adoptive parents will terminate their rights to raise their own children so that another couple can raise the children.
The main goal of science is to explore the workings of the world through the scientific method. In fact, this method serves as a framework for nearly all scientific research.
However, it is not just one thing, experimentation and testing are methods used to eliminate at least one assumption by asking questions and observation is also a guideline for scientific research.
Religious studies and philosophy scholars are interested in ancient Greek and Roman texts, particularly the Bible in Latin.
The perspective of Aristotle has been accepted in all branches of science including psychology.
When the knowledge of the Greeks declined, the Western nations found themselves cut off from the philosophical and scientific foundations of Greece.
There are many different rhythms in biological and behavioral mechanisms that are often dependent on the presence of biological rhythms within the body and their functioning through the biological clock of those rhythms.
The rhythm that occurs periodically (which is not just a response to external signals that is periodic) has been documented to exist in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is an oscillator that can work on its own, which will continue to work independently even when there is no external cue.
The experiments of Hershey and Chase are a significant evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Ches use phage or virus to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted the experiment twice, specifying DNA on the face with phosphorus-32 or specifying the protein of the face with sulfur-35.
The impact of mutations varies depending on the type of mutation, the important characteristics of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only the transmission of genetic material in cells can be transmitted to offspring, while other mutations may cause cells to die or become cancerous.
Visiting natural attractions attracts those who are interested in exploring natural areas and enjoying the scenery, including trees and wildlife.
Examples of activities at the location include animal hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, garden touring, and learning about the ecosystem.
Examples include visiting, photographing, and learning about organgatuangs in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of the small rural town to head to work. The road is filled with people heading to work at places they have just arrived from.
In this public transportation system, everyone has a role or supports traveling by private car in one way or another.
Science now identifies that the economic system utilizing this massive amount of carbon has caused an imbalance in the Earth's environment and atmosphere where living organisms reside, which has previously supported human development for two million years.
Everyone is a part of society and uses the transportation system, and almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In a developed country, you will hardly hear complaints at this level about the quality of water or collapsed bridges.
Why does the transport system lead to complaints like this? Why do errors occur every day? Are the transport system engineers incompetent or is there something more fundamental happening?
The flow of traffic is the study of the movement between two points of a driver and a vehicle and the interaction between both parties.
It is unfortunate that studying about the flexibility of traffic is difficult, because the behavior of drivers is something that cannot be confidently predicted 100%.
It is fortunate that drivers tend to behave relatively similarly on the road, so the traffic flow tends to be reasonably constant enough to be roughly quantified mathematically.
In order to improve the flow of traffic, the relationship between the three main properties are determined, namely (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and implementing the operation of facilities on the roads.
Insects are the first animals to fly in the air. The ability to fly helps them to easily evade enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage that they can fold their wings according to the length of their body.
Help them have small, diverse hiding places to escape from the hunters.
At present, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward are moths and whiteflies.
Many thousands of years ago, a man named Aristotle said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people agree with his idea, but many others believe the opposite that the solar system, including the sun (and even other planets), revolves around the Earth.
It seems to make sense because the world doesn't seem to be moving like it should. Is that true?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest river in the world, with a flow greater than the second largest river by more than 8 times.
In addition, the Amazon River is also the widest river in the world, with some sections reaching up to six miles wide.
Water 20 percent flows out of various rivers of the world into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The Mekong River's main stem is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and is the combined result of thousands of smaller tributaries.
Although the construction of pyramids with stones will continue until the end of the ancient kingdom era, the size and technical excellence in building the great pyramid of Giza is considered superior.
The ancient Egyptians in the new kingdom were all amazed when they saw the ancient ruins of the ancestors who were over a thousand years old.
Nakhon Watikan has a population of about 800 people, making it the smallest independent country with the smallest population in the world.
Nakhon Wadthikam uses Italian language for official legislation and communication.
Most people working in the state use Italian as their everyday language, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Nakhon Wadikhan are Romans catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and bronze since ancient times, because these things can be found in nature in their original forms, and can also be relatively easily mined with various digging tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is composed of at least one or more of the four elements, which are earth, water, air, and fire.
This is like the status of all four elements more important (in the same order), which is solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, he also theorized that they would change into new substances to become the things we see.
In general, an alloy is a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Different elements such as calcium and potassium are considered as metals, and of course there are still metals like silver and gold as well.
Apart from this, you may have alloys composed of metallic elements such as carbon mixed in small amounts.
Every substance in the universe is made up of atoms.
Atoms are so small that they can be packed into the millions in the smallest subatomic particle.
Therefore, the pencil becomes a good friend to many people when selling in the market.
The sad thing is when there are new ways of writing emerging, traditional writing is being phased out and marginalized.
People nowadays can write messages on a computer screen without having to hunch over a pile of notebooks and pencils.
We can only wonder how the keyboard will change when something new comes in.
Nuclear fusion in a fashion works on the principle that the combining of large amounts of protons and neutrons requires energy.
It's like pushing a mortar up a mountain. The reseparation of the nucleus will release some of that energy.
Some types of atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to separate from each other by only a slight vibration, or may not vibrate at all.
The surface of the moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The near side of the shell is about 70 km thick, while the far side is about 100 km thick.
The crust of the moon will be thinner in the part that is the lunar sea (Maria) but thicker in the highland area.
The near side of the shore may have more mud than this because the skin is thinner, making it easier for larvae to reach the surface.
The content of the theory focuses on investigating what makes people choose or interested.
These theories demonstrate that people have needs and/or desires that arise during their development into adulthood.
These theories consider what makes some people want what they have and what in their environment will prompt them to act or not act on certain things.
Two prominent content-based theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, there are two possible behaviors when a manager brings a former colleague to work together, one is trying to be "part of them" (or you).
Managers in this category have trouble making unpopular decisions, enforcing discipline, evaluating job performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, a person turned into an unforgettable person who felt that he or she had to change everything the team had done and make it his or her own.
No matter what, leaders must take responsibility for the success and failure of the team.
Behavior like this often results in tension and division between the leader and everyone else on the team.
The team seems to have the same standard of excellence as the traditional team, but with subtle differences.
Team members often serve as the point of contact for closely-knit physical therapy groups.
They often have team members who prefer to work independently more than following the original template because their team may encounter each other at different time zones, which may not be understood by the local managers.
The presence of the "Lohngnoh Team" that is authentic (Laurent and Laphat, 1989, p. 109) remains a unique component of the team as well.
"The management team" is a team in which every member must report. The management team will set standards for each member.
Why does an organization need to go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals in implementing the concept of organizational learning is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in different departments throughout the organization, creativity and innovation can occur.
The process of organizations working together to overcome obstacles can lead to a new process that is innovative to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can have a culture of innovation, the leadership must create a culture of collaboration, creativity, and sharing knowledge and learning within the organization.
Angel (2006) explains that the Continuum framework is a way to help organizations become more efficient and successful.
Neurophysiological data provide physical evidence for investigating the cognitive processes in theoretical neuroscience. These data help narrow the scope of research and make research more precise.
The relationship between the brain's pathology and behavior will help support scientists in their research.
It has long been known that damage to the brain of various types, including injury, illness, and tumors, affects behavior and can lead to changes in mental function.
The increase in new technologies helps us to see and inspect the overall structure and functioning of the brain in ways that were not previously possible.
This allows us to have a wealth of information and content to create scenario models, which helps us understand the processes in the mind.
Although the AI system has a clear underlying meaning to science fiction novels, AI is an important branch of computer science in managing behaviors, learning, and adapting cleverly of machines.
The study of AI research is related to making machines perform tasks that require intelligent behavior automatically.
Examples include controlling, planning, and scheduling the ability to respond to customer comments and questions, as well as remembering handwriting, speech, and facial expressions.
These various things have become separate branches that emphasize providing practical solutions to real-life problems.
Currently, AI systems are commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, as well as in the software applications for computers used at home and various video games.
Field trips are an important part of every classroom. It is often the case that teachers take their students to various places that cannot be reached by public transportation.
Technology offers a way to solve problems through virtual reality exploration. Students can view artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful artworks while sitting in classrooms with others.
Sharing real-life educational experiences is a very good way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future studies.
For example, students from the Bennett School in North Carolina designed their own travel website to their state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the old version is still available online for reference.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing, even though students often start their blogging experience with incorrect grammar and spelling. However, generally having a reader can help correct those errors.
Since students are often the most important group of readers, the bloggers have started to improve their writing heavily in order to avoid criticism.
Writing a blog also "pushes students to understand the world around them more." The desire to respond to readers' interests creates motivation for students to be smart and interesting. (Toto, 2004)
Writing a blog is a tool that supports collaboration and promotes students to learn more outside of regular class hours.
Using blogs appropriately "can promote students to learn to analyze and evaluate more effectively, helping students to position themselves in the context of others' writings through responding to internet content enthusiastically, as well as summarizing their own perspectives on the given issues" (Arawak, 2002).
Ottawa is the bilingual capital of Canada, with a beautiful and orderly city filled with art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
The southern part is full of beautiful nature such as the Niagra Falls, while the northern part still possesses the pure nature of Yellowstone and others.
These and other things make Ontario stand out and become the heart of Canada in the eyes of outsiders.
The large area located far north has a relatively sparse population, and some areas are so deserted that almost no one lives there.
The comparison of the population that makes people wonder is that African Americans living in tUnited States have a significantly larger population than Canadians.
The East African archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
By having Madagascar as the largest and biggest island than any other islands, it can be called a continent itself when it comes to the diversity of plant and wildlife.
Small islands mostly have sovereignty or are related to France, and are known as luxurious resorts by the beach.
In addition, Arabs have also taken Islam to various lands and have gained great popularity in Comoros and Maiaot.
The influence of Europe and the colonial dominance began in the 15th century when Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, found sea routes from Europe to India.
The northern area borders with Sahel, while the southern and western directions border the Atlantic Ocean.
Woman: I recommend all female travelers to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can be beneficial (but not one that looks too expensive).
The women realized that cultural differences might make them feel like they are being violated and it is not unusual for them to be followed, grabbed, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and do not be afraid to stand firm (whether there are cultural differences or not, it is not acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century and was used as a strategic seaport by the Romans, Phoenicians, and Merenids, called Anfa.
Portuguese settlers destroyed this place and rebuilt it with the name Casa Branca, just to abandon it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco built this city anew using the name Daru l-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who established their trading base there named it Casablanca.
Kasablanka is one of the least interesting places for shopping in Morocco.
In the old town of Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as Tajine, pottery, leather goods, hukkah, and many other souvenirs, but all of these are only for tourists.
Koh Samui is a tourist destination of the Republic of the Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In the year 2545 BE, the city of Goma was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Nyiragongo, causing most of the city's roads, especially in the downtown area, to be buried underground.
Even though Koh Samui may be reasonably safe, if going outside the city, it is advisable to study the information beforehand to understand the current situation in the conflict-affected areas in North Kohuwu province.
This city is still a base for hiking the Nyiragongo volcano as well as trekking the highest mountains in Africa.
You can travel around Koh Ma by hiring a motorbike taxi, and the normal price (locally) will be around 500 baht for short-distance travel.
When combined with difficult access, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for distant and unfamiliar lands.
At present, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its reputation has turned it into a tourist destination and it also has an airport.
In the year 2533, this place was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of sand encroachment in the desert and sand in the sea.
This is one of the key rest stops during the PBS special documentary series on the wonders of African safari by Henry Louis Gates Jr.
This city is different from other cities in the country in every aspect, due to its much more tropical atmosphere than that of Africa.
Khoo Kheun Pee National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, adjacent to the eastern border of Mozambique. It is situated to the north of the Zambezi River with the southern border adjacent to the Crocodile River.
This park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers, divided into 14 diverse ecosystems that each support different types of wildlife.
Here is one of the main tourist destinations in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks)
There are conservation fees and entrance fees collected for national parks each day, just like other national parks in South Africa and elsewhere.
In addition, if anyone buys a Wild Card entrance ticket, it may be more worthwhile because it allows access to national parks in Southern Africa, which can choose to visit only some or all of them as desired.
Hong Kong Island has made the territory of Hong Kong famous and is also a place that many tourists consider to be a priority.
The building that is located neatly, which makes up the Hong Kong skyline, is used to be compared to a bar chart of light columns made easy to see with the water visible in the area of Victoria Harbour.
If you want to see the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the waterfront of Kowloon opposite.
The majority of urban development in Hong Kong has been densely concentrated along the northern coastline reclaimed area.
This is the place where the British colonists hold as their own. So if you are looking for evidence of the past of this civilization, this is a good starting point.
Sun Darbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching approximately 80 km (50 miles) along the coast, towards the fertile hinterland of Bangladesh and India, away from the coast.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans as a world heritage site, and a part of the forest within the borders of India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forest patch not only has a variety of mangrove forests, but also has remnants of large forests that once covered the plains of the river basin.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometers, with approximately one-third of it being covered by water/wetlands.
Suntoraporn is a wildlife sanctuary area established since 1966. It is estimated that currently, there are about 400 Indochinese tigers and approximately 30,000 sambar deer in this area.
Passenger buses depart from the inter-provincial bus terminal (across the river) throughout the day. Most of the buses heading towards the east and Jakar/Bumthang depart from the terminal between 06.30 and 07.30 hrs.
I suggest buying tickets in advance for two to three days ahead, as buses between districts often get full.
In most areas, there are small, convenient and reliable passenger vans.
The same taxi to travel together is a convenient and efficient mode of transportation to nearby destinations. For example, to Pharo city (150 baht) and to Punakha city (200 baht).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a bridge held by cables that spans the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Both tower poles are slanting up to 83 meters high, with a length of 378 meters and consisting of 2 lanes, each lane is 3.50 meters wide.
The bridge is 15 meters high from the ground and was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened for use until March 2017.
The mentioned bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, which is the expected time for the completion of Brazil's customs checkpoint.
Guaraní is the most important indigenous community living in the Paraguay Eastern Region, currently sustaining themselves through semi-nomadic farming.
The Chaco region used to be a habitat for indigenous tribes such as Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, which was once known as the "Great Monster Province of the Indies Archipelago," emerged from the confrontation between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous people.
The Spanish people were the ones who created a colonial empire that lasted for three centuries.
Since its establishment in 1537, Asunción has preserved many characteristics and identities of the indigenous people.
Argentina is known for having the best polo team and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will be held in December at the Polo Field in Las Canas, Costa Rica.
You can enjoy apartment tours and small-scale competitions here at other times of the year.
For various news and information about polo sports competitions and ticket purchasing for admission, please check at the Asociacion Argentina de Polo (Argentine Polo Association).
The official currency used in Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equal to one pound sterling (GBP).
You can exchange money at the bank, but only at the one on the island opposite to the FC West store.
In general, the British pound can be used everywhere in this archipelago, including when using credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
It is possible that the islands may not accept credit cards, even though they may accept currencies from the UK and the USA. Check with the owner in advance to determine acceptable payment methods.
It's almost impossible to exchange currency of the Falkland Islands outside of the island, so exchange money before leaving the island.
Due to its location south of the equator, when the northern hemisphere is winter, it is summer there. And when the northern hemisphere is summer, it is winter there.
Montevideo is located in a semi-tropical region during the hot season, temperatures above 30°C are considered normal.
The winter may be colder than expected, meaning that the actual temperature may not drop below freezing point, but it will feel colder than what the thermometer indicates due to the wind and humidity.
There is no distinct "rainy season" and "dry season", especially as the amount of rainfall is relatively consistent throughout the year.
Even though many animals in the national park are familiar with seeing humans, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park officer stated that you should stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wild dogs, and 25 meters away from all other wildlife.
No matter how intimidating they may look, rhinoceroses, moose, bears, and most large animals can be attacked by elephants.
In each year, many tourists have been injured due to not maintaining a safe distance from the animals. These animals are large, aggressive, and can be dangerous, so it is necessary to keep a distance to give them space.
Please note that different scents will attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling foods and keep the campsite clean at all times.
"Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the Upolu island, with a population of just under 40,000 people."
The city of Ayutthaya was established in the year 1850 and has been the official capital of Siam since 1959.
This port is the site of a naval conflict that erupted in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
Every boat was deliberately sunk, except for the lone English ship. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, the peaceful demonstration in the city resulted in the assassination of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the paramount chief of the Mau movement.
There are many beaches because there are two docks on opposite shores, and the most popular beach is located in the third area.
