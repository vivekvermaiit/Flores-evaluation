Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide spectrum of practical ideas, starting rapidly and with strong reason, quickly determining human fate logically, caused by scientific laws and their implementation in technology.

For example, a pedestrian can say that the prioritization of traffic requires cars.
However, the country's public transport network is not economically viable for a small number of vehicles, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of car production.
As a result of the increasing cases of road accidents, which can be attributed to the aim of rejuvenating the injured bodies, the main reason for the development of new technologies is the increase in the number of motor vehicle owners.
Cultural determinism manifested an important part of romanticism, which emerged from such writers as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.

The development of a natural village reflects the fact that food is produced in the quantity necessary only for the subsistence of the farmer and his family.

A method that was widely used in the illustration of the significance of socialization, connected with children's several unfortunate situations, when their socialization does not increase during the period of growth, due to lack of attention, poverty or excessive power abuse.
Such children are called wild or feral. Some feral child cases were documented (though most of them were disputed by the public); in some cases, the reason for the abandonment of the child by the parents was their serious emotional or physical abuse.
The abandoned children may have experienced physical abuse or neglect while they were left alone or were thrown out of the house.
They say that other animals have evolved; they also say that some lived semi-solitarily in the wild.
After being raised by completely domesticated animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (by potentially inhibited physical capabilities) that are almost identical to those of its animal caregiver, such as fear or aggression towards humans.

The study of traffic flow involves understanding the interactions between specific drivers and vehicles, the two points of movement, and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, learning to drive is very difficult because predicting the driver's behavior is 100% accurate.
Drivers operate in a mental state within the range of emotional stability; thus, transportation operators tend to have a certain mental stability and can be easily predicted mathematically.

Despite the fact that it resulted in a more stable condition of all four aggregates (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, it was also assumed that their transformation into new material occurred for the sake of what we create.
You may have overlooked the fact that the periodic system of Mendeleev's elements combines many elements.

The existence of a unique component of the virtual team represents the true "visible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109).
"The national team" is a disciplined team, whose every member is accountable. "The national team" sets standards for each member.
Why does the organization want to go through the difficult process of creating a educational organization? Innovation represents one of the main goals of incorporating organizational educational knowledge into practice.

For example, in North Carolina, students of the Bennet School annually create a website about the public transportation in the capital city, and the website is updated annually. However, old versions, like the travel guidebook, are stored online.
Students can also start blogs to write. Then, when students start their own blog experiments with poor grammar and orthography, the existence of the auditorium changes everything.
The blog author tries to write in a way to minimize criticism from the most critical audience, students.
The creation of a blog also “alienates students, forcing them to respect their existing territory”. The necessity of the involvement of the audience's interests obliges the students to be more active, to be more motivated and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages students to collaborate and enables them to continue their traditional school day learning.
Students may be given motivation to become more analytical and critical through the use of blogs, and by actively reacting to online materials, they can define their own positions and perspectives in the context of other students' work on specific issues. (Oravec, 2002)
