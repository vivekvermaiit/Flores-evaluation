The sentence translates to: "It not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils often cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement."
The researchers say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on the upper side, with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Given that dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or quill, but do have other feather features - barbs and barbules - the researchers concluded that the quill was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flying but instead for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that the specimen shows an adult feather covering and not chicken down, even though the tail comes from a young dinosaur.
The researchers believed that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathering and not young down.

The work performed was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the research team was looking for would be caused by forces similar to tidal forces of the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just like the moon exerts gravitational pull on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The researchers were able to determine that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory states that the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo, and is made up of lots of small particles.

Doctor Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "very concerning and alarming due to the very high level of mortality."
Some patients may have been infected with the bacteria at the hospital, believes Dr. Moll, of which at least two were hospital staff.
During the year, an infected person can transmit the infection to between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, it seems that the proportion of XDR-TB among the entire group of people with tuberculosis is still low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground," says Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Surveys (USGS) team for astrogeology and at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet of paper with their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting document.
French electoral legislation codifies the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the voting and that no envelopes are added except those duly counted from the eligible voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers who are under extensive supervision and follow specific procedures.

In her second race, giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting group, with a combined time of 4:41.30. This was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first place with Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth place with Hungarian Gy√∂ngyi Dani.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group could not complete their runs, and 45 out of the total 117 participating skiers in the giant slalom did not manage to place in the competition.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and found her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki announced that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
Despite three people being in the house when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue service cut the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to hospital at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been accused in Edinburgh's sheriff court of murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting trial, but all eyewitness evidence may become worthless because her image has been widely published.
This is common in other parts of the UK, but Scottish law operates differently and courts have considered the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson at the University of Dundee states that "journalists are choosing a dangerous line if they publish pictures, etc. of suspects."
The Criminal Division (Crown Office), which has the overall responsibility for prosecution, has informed journalists that no further comments will be made before prosecution.
According to the leak, the document is about the border dispute, where the Palestinians want the borders to be based on those before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other subjects that are said to be reported on are the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands ten years of constant military presence in the valley after an agreement has been signed, while the PA only approves such a presence for five years.
Hunters in the supplementary pest control trial would be closely monitored by the park keepers as the trial was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, volunteers were recruited during the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and culture at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting mission received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new provisional election council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council within the course of four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the former provisional election council should resign as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's answer to the extensive protests against the regime that started in October.
The partially violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been overdue since 2011.
There have been reports of about 60 cases where poorly constructed iPods have overheated, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (Meti) of Japan said that they knew about 27 accidents related to the units.
METI announced last week that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company referred to as "minor."
"The department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report 'very regrettable.'"
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The office of the Northern Mariana Islands' fire department announced that no damages have been reported in the country.
Even the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center confirmed that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and older individuals, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later swapped places with an elderly lady because she needed to use the toilet. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained to become an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would speed up the lung maturity of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that the government's investigators recovered two "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Wrestling colleagues also praised Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died under the night with two moons. Quite unique just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said in a comment that "Luna was as big a freak as I am ... maybe even bigger ... love her and will miss her ... hopefully she's better off where she is now."
Out of 1,400 people surveyed before the federal election in 2010, the number of people against Australia becoming a republic had grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the participants in the survey share this view, that Queen Elizabeth II should become Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of the respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim 100m and 200m freestyle as well as three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his troubles there has been doubt about his condition.
He has not been able to take the medicines needed to overcome his pain because they are prohibited in the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number to date, on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water resources on Earth, along with organic material, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Since comets collided with the Earth long ago, researchers hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
"He referred to the rumors as ""political gossip and nonsense""."
There is speculation that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would result in planes flying shorter distances, saving millions of liters of fuel each year, and reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older ground radar-based technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation will be added, and overland trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride stations are not available at ground level.
The fear of a lack of transportation opened up the possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Gal√°pagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though this process is believed to have taken much longer due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant Espa√±ola Darwin's finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into all kinds of forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled into thin thread that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
"It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called ""illuminated manuscripts""."
This is called the pH value for a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The juice from the cabbage changes in shade depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together. Then shape them into a ball using clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman society, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women stayed together.
When you call someone hundreds of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was sent out into space with the help of a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and field of view.
It takes a giant rocket over 30 meters to get a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has brought is to give us much easier and faster transportation methods.
It has given us the train, the car and many other modes of transport.
Under them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, everything from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including domestic cats) that consume a much larger amount of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret behind their success is the concept of a niche, a specific job for each cat that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats, and live in large groups called prides.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males together with as many as thirty females and young.
The females are often closely related to each other; a large family of sisters and daughters.
The hyena acts very much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very lethal to their prey.
The tiger, as a versatile athlete, can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is part of the same group (the genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of the lion, but more like a sentence of growling, screaming words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Researchers believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) through smell, by sniffing the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on the prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population they originate from (for example if they move over a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they often end up in a different environment than the one they were previously in.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so in order to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different traits or adaptations than they have needed before.
The indigenous population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new surroundings, they start to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans release (i.e. exhale).
Plants produce food with the help of sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make our clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is plants. Without the plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain during its time, so it had nothing to fear except other mosasaurs.
The long jaws were lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the palate, meaning there was no chance of escape for anything that crossed its path.
We're not entirely sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked everything that came into the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Even though most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their fair share of strange or unusual feast items such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a kind of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they could recline on their side while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained food that arrived in Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries.
They for example did not have corn, nor tomatoes, cocoa or potatoes, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the god's home.
People brought offering gifts to the gods and the priests tried to appease the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests had access to.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not as important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
Women cooked food in the courtyard; shops were only open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland as punishment for murder, and that when he traveled west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
"Even though each country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the peoples, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland."
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might believe that there is a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
It is not true, however. Even if there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the declaration of independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" were written. The text is displayed on the bottom of the document, upside down."
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we know that the large parchment (measuring 75.6 cm x 62.2 cm) was rolled up for storage early in its existence.
So it is likely that the text was just written there as a label.
The landings on D-Day and the subsequent battles had freed northern France, but the south was still not free.
"It was governed by the 'Vichy' French. These were French people who had come to an agreement with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them."
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon"."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also somehow defines the size of society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. A civilized culture means that knowledge is transferred between several generations, a lingering cultural footprint, and a fair distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as real civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with the congress as the only component - according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to impose taxes and, since there was no national executive power or judiciary, it fell on the state authorities, which were often uncooperative, to carry out all its decisions.
It also did not have the authority to repeal tax laws and customs duties between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all the states before they could be added, and the states attached so little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italian national football, along with the German football team, is the world's second most successful team and was the champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
With its many islands, Japan is often geographically considered an archipelago.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 1400s when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, which means beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiates a conversion of the original grain production, hiring Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After the defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War in 1895, the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which sovereignty over Taiwan is given to Japan, which then governs the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been renovated to give tourists a better idea of how they looked in their original state.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but even more important is its aspect ratio which has been inherited by the formats of photo sensors in digital cameras.
The 35-millimeter format is, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio in this format (divide by twelve to achieve the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as APS format) correspond to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The much abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a certain order in an image.
It is claimed that the best placement for the subject is where the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally intersect (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was scrutinized.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound together European states despite their differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power affected everyone from king to common man.
One of the main teachings of Christianity states that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are intended for that purpose.
The central power of the church had been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many question whether this principle was being upheld.
Shortly after the conflict broke out, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective in cutting off necessary military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law as codified in numerous international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent all ships from crossing entire areas of the sea, making it risky even for neutral ships.
Since they had received a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to their unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude was pacifism and isolation among most of the residents and countries.
After witnessing the horror and atrocities of war during the First World War, countries wanted to avoid a repetition of such a situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to start working at Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
The old China had a unique way of distinguishing different time periods; each stage in China's history, or each family that held power, was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable period where the provinces were divided. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms, which took place during the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, violent warfare often occurred between many noblemen who fought for the throne.
The three kingdom period was one of the bloodiest times in ancient China's history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to sit on the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not a single ruler.
Furthermore, the professions were opened up to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same applies to the military, as rank within the army is now based on caliber instead of on class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people from the working class in other countries to make a revolution.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in subjects beyond his everyday life. He used to often visit a cave that became known as "Hira" on the "Noor" mountain (light) to contemplate."
The cave itself, which survived the passage of time, gives a very clear picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, located on one of the mountain peaks north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's actually not easy to find even if you know it exists. Inside the cave, it's total isolation.
It is not possible to see anything other than the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid of Cheops is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau, or ""Giza Necropolis"" in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller burial monuments, several temples, and the Great Sphinx."
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The marking for "upward stroke" looks like a V and the marking for "downward stroke" like a bracket or a square without a bottom side.
Up means that you should start at the tip and press the bow upwards, and down means that you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow downwards.
A downstroke typically generates a softer sound, while an upstroke is stronger and more resolute.
One may draw their own markings, but remember that the printed string markings are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame √âlisabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows wide open.
At one point, one of the participants in the mob swung the head of an imperial guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses for the American imperialism's conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the cost and interest on bonds in the name of the Filipino government through Wall Street's bankers.
Of course, the substantial profits deriving from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period when the events took place is often called the high middle ages, the period of European history from the 11th to the 14th century.
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which formally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many different ideas in practice, from the technology driving development or the technological imperative in the strict sense to the belief that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic related to the laws of nature and how they are manifested in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: that technological development follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are original, rather than socially conditioned."
For example, one could say that the motor-driven car inevitably leads to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically sustainable for just a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Ownership of cars also leads to a higher occurrence of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new medical techniques to repair injured bodies.
The Romanticism contained a large element of determinism originating from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography shaped individuals and over time customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and those that harmonized with the place of society were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began to circulate around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
Its influence decreased during the 14th century mainly due to the fact that crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued higher than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was around this time that the title Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 11th-12th centuries and the 13th century.
In the beginning, clothes were strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
Due to the slow communication routes, the styles in the west could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of enough food to only meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple, often ecological, system that uses saved seeds from the eco-region combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced self-sufficient agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by society and allow them to find their identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the members' age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be of linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographic nature, or it can be a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinct and symbolic style choice, including fashion, demeanor, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or intentional abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their upbringing.
"Such children are called "wild". Some wild children have been confined by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the parents rejecting a child's serious intellectual or physical disabilities."
Wild children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness entirely on their own.
When the feral child is raised entirely by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely identical to those of the specific caregiving animal, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, support teaching goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a support for individuals who are learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the little help icon in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalized in the software and is intended to question, guide, and explain methods that may have been too challenging for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for many different reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, or educational, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our family home system is designed to provide secure homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster homes are meant to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home they previously came from.
Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The internet's distinct characteristics lead to further dimensions in terms of user theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivators for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Even ""personal commitment"" and ""continuous relationships"" were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when examining audience reactions to websites."
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro expressions, facial expressions that last a few milliseconds.
It is claimed in particular that one can determine if a person is lying by interpreting micro expressions correctly.
"Oliver Sacks showed in his writing ""The President's Speech"" how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately judge sincerity."
He even claims that we share such knowledge in interpreting human behavior with animals like tame dogs.
Research during the 20th century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of pronounced variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations back and forth between the two poles for each new generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy their need for amino acids from the available plants.
Furthermore, the absence of this has serious consequences; inhibited growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
As a comparison, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also offers high-quality proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
"When all is said and done, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in roughly the same way as chimpanzees on the savannah do today."
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you closer to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you usually turn off the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it at the other end of the room, so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorythm-based alternatives involve drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before sleep, which results in having to get up to pee.
The level of inner peace a person has correlates inversely with the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the current life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded with the path of love within Mahayana and many techniques within Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The deity yoga is central to Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras activated, and illuminated awareness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the USA. When the war ended, differences in systems, processes, and culture led to the collapse of the countries' cooperation.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be physically fought through mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland and simultaneously breaking the peace treaty in Riga, the non-aggression pact between Soviet and Poland, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The by far most effective way to transport large amounts of people and goods over the seas is to use ships for transporting cargo.
The job of naval mines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to transport your people and goods, while simultaneously disrupting the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to move troops and materials across the Atlantic to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily with the help of submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
The cultures and tribes of ancient times had them to get milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed on hills or other grazing areas, often tended by shepherds who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known sheepherder. These herding methods are still used today.
Tramways for wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though wagon roads consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve higher speeds and pull greater loads than on the coarser roads of the time.
Rails were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had a layer of iron on top.
This became standard practice, but the iron wore more on the wooden wagon wheels.
Gradually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first rails entirely in iron were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, people began to walk upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (which means the upright person) came into existence.
Their predecessors, australopithecus, were not known for walking upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can engage in the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases symptomatic treatment. But if we do not just want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is evident that the world has changed significantly due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and the problems have worsened due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away.
"During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the yard at Independence Hall on July 8th.
A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 of Dunlap's broadsides that are known to still exist are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The handwritten original has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still exist today. We call them birds.
Many do not think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like those of the dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is coded in the form of binary digits.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits - or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always immediately noticeable. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best sign of poisoning can be an open jar of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term "beetles" is used in a formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term originates from ancient kinship with bedbugs, insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both carpet beetles and bed bugs are home dwellers, adapted to living in their host's nest or home.
In the USA, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their interest, or is for the best of their children, to raise a child.
These couple can choose to establish an adoption plan for their child.
During an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method is guiding in almost all research.
However, it is not alone. Experimenting, where an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, especially, on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's view on all scientific issues, including psychology, was accepted.
When knowledge of Greek decreased, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often largely due to the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that repeats its cycle over a period even in the absence of external influence.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to plant their own DNA in a bacterium.
They performed two experiments that labeled either the DNA in the substance with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the substance with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be inherited by children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of experiencing the landscape, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is to visit, take photographs and learn more about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns in cars to go to their jobs and are passed by others whose destination for work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is in some way connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has disrupted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transport system. Basically, everyone complains about the transport system.
In developed countries, similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely heard.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because driver behaviors cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
As it happens, motorists tend to behave fairly consistently; thus, the traffic tends to flow fairly consistently and can be presented mathematically in broad terms.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These conditions are helpful in planning, designing, and operating facilities along the roads.
The insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings alongside their bodies.
This gives them more small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Today the only insects that cannot fold in their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
For thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system was moving around the sun.
Some people believed he was right but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and also the other stars).
This seems reasonable, since it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the world's most water-rich and second longest river. Its water flow is more than 8 times the size of the second largest river.
Amazonas is also the widest river on earth, 9 km wide in some places.
Twenty percent of the water flowing into the oceans from the earth's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main channel of the Amazon River is 6,387 km long. It receives its water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids in Giza were never surpassed in size and construction technique.
The new kingdom's ancient Egyptians marveled at their predecessors' monuments, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has around 800 inhabitants. It is the world's smallest independent country and the country with the lowest number of inhabitants.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as these can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything consisted of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, even though he had theories about them changing into new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many different elements in the periodic table.
Subjects such as calcium and potassium are counted as metals. There are, of course, also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic substances such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a loyal companion for many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have been developed, the pencil has received lower status and fewer areas of use.
Today, people are writing messages on computer screens, and never need to come near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that it takes energy to create a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Roughly like rolling a heavy wagon uphill. Splitting the core again, releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable cores and it doesn't take much for them to decay.
The surface of the moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner beneath the seas and thicker beneath the highlands.
There may be more cracks on the nearby side because the crust is thinner there. This made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories revolve around finding out what motivates people or what appeals to them.
The theories argue that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow older.
These theories look at what makes certain people want what they want and what in their environment prompts them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former peers. At one end of the spectrum, the manager tries to remain ""one of the gang""."
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, perform disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, assign responsibilities and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
When all is said and done, the leader is ultimately responsible for whether the team succeeds or fails.
This behavior often results in gaps between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams maintain the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members tend to act as a contact point for the physical group.
They often have more say than conventional team members as different time zones can affect when their team can meet and this may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p.109) is also a unique component in a virtual team.
"The "invisible team" is the management team to which all members report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of beginning to use organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in an organization's functional departments, creativity and inventiveness can flourish.
Therefore, the process for an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create an innovation culture as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to support organizations in achieving higher performance levels.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, it narrows down the research area and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain diseases and behavior supports researchers in their research.
It has long been known that different brain injuries, traumas, diseases, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technology allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we have not seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models which help us understand processes in our mind.
Even though AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch within computer science that includes the behavior, learning, and intelligence of machines.
Research in AI is about getting machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnosis and questions, and also recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in economics, medicine, technology, and the military, and has been built into several home computers and video game software applications.
Field studies are a big part of the teaching in every class. Often, the teacher wants to take the students to places where buses do not go.
The technology offers solutions with virtual study visits. Students can view museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a study trip virtually is also a good way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital; the website is redone every year, but previous versions are left online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also contribute to improving students' writing. Students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of readers generally improves this.
As students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to write better to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to become more aware of the world". The demand to cater to readers' interests stimulates students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that provides inspiration for collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"Appropriate use of blogs can provide students with the opportunity to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online material, students can define their positions in relation to what others have written, as well as articulate their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and offers a variety of galleries and museums that showcase Canada's present and past.
Further south lies Niagara Falls and in the northern part you will find the beautiful, untouched nature of Muskoka.
All of this and more make Ontario what outsiders consider to be the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are close to being wilderness with few inhabitants.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a distinct continent in terms of fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or belong to France, and are known as luxurious resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the areas, which had a great impact in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope and thus found the sea route from Europe to India.
The region borders Sahel in the north and the Atlantic in the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's good to also wear a ring (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they would perceive as harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow them, grab their arm, etc.
Be assertive when saying no to men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences do not make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city of Daru l-Badya, which was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes, and a whole spectrum of knick-knacks, but it's all too touristy.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located farthest east near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly in the central areas.
Goma is fairly safe, but if you are going to visit outside of Goma, you should investigate the situation with the conflicts in the northern Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekkings in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price for the short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Combined with its relative inaccessibility, ""Timbuktu"" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, remote locations."
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat from desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates PBS program Wonders of the African world.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities in the country, with an atmosphere that is more Arabic than African.
Kruger national park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, while the southern boundary is the Crocodile river.
The park covers 19,500 km¬≤ and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which houses different wild animals.
It is one of the biggest attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship among South African national parks (SANParks).
The park charges daily conservation and entrance fees just like any other South African national parks.
It can also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, which either provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives the territory its name and is the place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The buildings in a row that make up Hong Kong's skyline have been likened to a sparkling bar graph, enhanced by the water in Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The vast majority of the buildings on Hong Kong Island are densely packed on former seabed along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers took over, so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world and stretches 80 km into Bangladesh and the Indian inland from the coast.
The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps - they contain some of the last remaining stands of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km¬≤, of which approximately one third is comprised of wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a reserve for wild animals, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axis deer in the area.
Buses depart from the district-wide bus station (across the river) all day, but most, especially those heading east towards Jakar/Bumthang, run between 6.30 and 7.30.
Since buses between the districts are often full, it is good advice to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxi cars are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It stretches over the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 meters up, it is 378 meters long and has two aisles that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs stations are expected to be ready.
Guaran√≠ was the most significant indigenous group that inhabited present-day eastern Paraguay and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as Guaycur√∫ and Payagu√°, who lived as hunters, gatherers, and fishermen.
"In the 16th century, Paraguay was born, previously called "the giant province of Indies", as a result of the meeting between the Spanish conquerors and groups from the native indigenous population."
The Spaniards initiated the colonization period that lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunci√≥n was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Ca√±itas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here during other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, you can turn to Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP) which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
GBP is generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley it is often possible to pay with credit card and USD.
Credit cards are probably not going to be accepted on the remote islands, but British and American currency can be accepted; contact the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is nearly impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; during the summer months, it is common to have temperatures above +30¬∞C
The winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely falls below zero, but the wind and air humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
"There are no specific ""rainy"" and ""dry"" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year."
Despite many of the animals in the park being accustomed to seeing humans, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you should stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how gentle they may appear, bison, moose, Kandahar deer, bears, and almost all large animals can go on the attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not maintain a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking food with strong odors and keep the camp clean.
Samoa's capital is called Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been Samoa's official capital since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of a notorious standstill in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Close to 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to Auckland's location between two harbors. The most popular beaches are divided into three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most of them offer shade from the maori myrtle.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes well-attended family beaches with a good selection of shops located by the beach. Swimming is safe.
"The main local beer is "Number one", which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta"."
There are many French wines, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may handle the journey better.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are worried.
"For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is unknown. A "short black" is an "espresso", cappuccino has a heap of cream (not froth) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate milk meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips are made to the reef all year round and damages due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, take the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cube jellyfish are found near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes also be found at other times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
The saltwater crocodile's main habitat is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton, so they usually do not live in the ocean.
Booking in advance gives the traveler security and assurance that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodations, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, transfers to and from the airport, and even combo trips that combine flights and hotels.
They can also reserve your booking for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain additional documents required for your destination (e.g. visa).
All changes and requests should go through the travel agency first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to where the action is happening, you have to come early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even though the music performances on the main stage have ended, parts of the festival can continue to play music well into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in the winter, check the location of the cabin, as breaking through the ice causes really terrible sounds for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see the conditions).
Casinos often do everything they can to get guests to spend as much time and money as possible. There are often no windows or clocks, and the exits are often hard to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and encourage them to stay in the venue.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages for free. But intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
All who are going to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware that snow, ice and temperatures below freezing point may occur.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can't drive in the same way as on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, it can snow enough in a very short time for you to get stuck.
Visibility can also be limited by snowfall or blizzard or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues essentially uninterrupted year-round.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourism industry in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular use refers to travel across the country to see the amazing African wild animals, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars and with standard equipment it is possible to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are better seen with binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called "bush walk" and "hiking safari") consists of walking either a few hours or for several days."
The Paralympics will take place between August 24th and September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies due to the coronavirus vary, but by the end of March, most do not extend as far as July 2020, when the Olympic Games were supposed to begin.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket price around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if it is not in the room.
If no iron is available, or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be vigilant and do not let the fabric become too hot (which can cause shrinking or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others, several minutes are required.
Filters can vary in effectiveness, and if you are uncertain, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from an established company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force, are usually not classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods without tax or other additional charges at certain locations.
Travelers on their way to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often goes through isolated forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, drive with caution: steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 56-64 km/h (35-40 mph) - and the importance of adhering to them is even greater than usual.
Strangely enough, the mobile coverage is much better here than along many other stretches, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really delicious, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those from the neighbor to the south, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common, with apples baked into pastries year-round and cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German pastries also have almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cookies often pair especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but powerful pastries, you can try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with either meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be either ""dry"" or ""moist"" depending on the amount of liquid."
In northern India and the inland regions of Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry dishes; in southern India and certain other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a collective term that encompasses a wide variety of regional dishes spread throughout the country.
But if used without a specifier, the term tends to mean the food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese culinary art, which is now available everywhere in the archipelago, offers a variety of simply spiced dishes, where the flavorings used most by the Javanese are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can pose a safety risk as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but is caught with one foot in the stirrup, they may be dragged if the horse runs off. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders have boots with heels and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that ensure that a stirrup comes loose from the saddle if pulled backwards by a rider falling off.
The Cocham√≥ Valley, Chile's premier climbing destination, is known as South America's Yosemite, and has a number of large granite cliffs and walls.
The mountain peaks offer views that can take your breath away. Climbers from all corners of the world constantly create new routes among the countless mountain walls.
Downhill skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport where one glides down a snow-covered landscape with skis or a snowboard strapped to their feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums", who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a specific area.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5,000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport has existed since at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also called backcountry ski, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountain climbing; The latter is done in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover a much greater distance than when walking - but you will rarely reach speeds similar to cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack in groomed tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control on several occasions.
The Schengen area functions roughly like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without undergoing passport controls multiple times.
In a similar way, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen member country separately. This saves you both time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured objects are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where age limits can be shorter, for example in North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, even though they are not as old as similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sami and the culture surrounding the trade is important even for many with other professions.
Historically, however, not all S√°mi people have been involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but have lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities and mostly used the reindeer as draft animals.
Today many Sami people work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in S√°pmi, the Sami area.
Even though it is often used, especially among non-Romani, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Romani people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel restriction, your travel medical insurance or cancellation protection may be affected.
You may also have requests to consult other governments than your own, but their advice is tailored to their own citizens.
For example, for American citizens in the Middle East, there may be different circumstances compared to Europeans or Arabs.
A travel advisory is just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The picture presented is often hasty, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available from other sources.
Extremely weather is the general term for all dangerous weather phenomena with the potential to cause harm, serious social disruptions, or loss of life.
Difficult weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different variations of them, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and wildfires are types and consequences of extreme weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include intense snowstorms, blizzards, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather affecting their area, as it may impact travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
"A search on the Internet for ""hostile environment training"" will probably yield the address of a local company."
A course usually goes through all the questions mentioned here but in much more detail, often with practical exercises.
A course typically lasts between 2-5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are plenty of books about how to survive in the wilderness, while books about war zones are rare.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without specified gender (X) or documents that are updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
Security checks have also become significantly more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender individuals who have not undergone surgery should not expect to be able to pass through the x-ray screening with their integrity and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow from waves breaking off the shore, often at a reef or similar.
The topology under the water causes the backflow to be concentrated in a few deeper parts, and strong currents leading to deep water can be formed there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion after trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you are out of the current, it's no harder than usual to swim back.
Try to aim somewhere where you won't get stuck again or, depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, wait to be rescued.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (there is not as much of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to new cultures sometimes have difficulty readjusting to their original culture.
Upon returning from living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits from your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, due to the awareness that travelers in a new country must adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the most interesting things for children at the site.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually you always hear the sounds of tourists and sellers. The sound and light narrative is just like a fairytale book.
The background is made up of the Sphinx, which tells a long history.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries, and they have the most bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the community Villa Las Estrellas.
Other includes Livingston Island and Deception where the flooded crater of an active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, and borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains here merge with the plateau and then reappear to form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, which is divided by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, with a highest peak at 4892 m in Mount Vinson.
In remote areas without mobile coverage, a satellite phone can be your only option.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, since one must be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions in need of remote data and voices.
Your local telecom operator should be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
Traveling and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year.
This is especially popular among newly graduated, which allows them to take a year off before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can actually increase the chances of getting into higher education in your home country.
Usually a fee is charged to register for these educational programs.
Finland is very boat-friendly. The land of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos.
In the archipelago and lakes, you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the archipelagos and the largest lakes are really big enough for any pleasure boat, smaller boats or even a kayak can offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seventh or eighth person.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands, the figure is one in forty).
Most of the specifically Baltic cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days while returning to and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore with ship excursions, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruises include the German capital Berlin in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a scary experience for people, regardless of age and background, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fear and aversion to other things that many people have.
Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome a fear related to discomfort with the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies have good pay for delivering things quickly. Often time is very important when it comes to business documents, commercial goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem for other routes and smaller companies.
If they have sent items by air freight, it may have taken several days to go through unloading and customs on some routes.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to shell out a whole lot of money for the privilege (or even better, have your company do it for you).
However, this does not come at a cheap price: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy price for business and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no point in even looking for discounts for seats in business or first class on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay well for the privilege of traveling somewhere quickly and comfortably. The companies also charge accordingly.
Moldova's capital is Chi≈üinƒÉu. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been affected by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any of the member countries of the UN.
The economic relations have been reinstated between these two parts of Moldova, despite failures in the political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
The city, which in historical times was called Smyrna, is today a modern, developed city and a lively commercial center located by a huge port surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are mixed with traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th-century marketplaces, and old mosques and churches, even though the city has an atmosphere more similar to Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village Haldarsv√≠k offers a view of the nearby island Eysturoy, and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble statues of doves over some of the graves.
It's worth wandering around the captivating village for half an hour.
In the north within reach is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after a glowing account of its grandeur by Lord Byron.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, also visit the fantastic Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (sanctuary), a place world famous for the apparitions of Mary.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site and a place that has an almost unfathomable significance for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death here; Jews as well as non-Jews.
Use the website with the great dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by painting or scratching graffiti on structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half prefer to speak Catalan, an overwhelming majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
Most signs are, however, only in Catalan, as it is the primary official language according to the law.
Spanish is also used in many places in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the subway are only made in Catalan, but unplanned disturbances are communicated by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
"Even though this is often just a false stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to behave in the best way and act like someone who is 'bien √©lev√©' (well-mannered). It will make it significantly easier to get around."
The Parisians' brusque exterior will quickly disappear if you show your polite side.
The national park of Plitvice Lakes is covered with dense forest, mainly beech, spruce and fir, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a strikingly large diversity of species, due to the range of microclimates, different soils, and varying differences in altitude.
The area is also home to an extreme diversity of animal and bird species.
Rare animal species such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be found there, along with many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear a skirt that covers the knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide shawls for women who have not prepared in advance, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
According to the same logic, men must dress in trousers that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the storage in the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after every person so you may not feel comfortable using these skirts. One size fits all applies to men!
Mallorcan food, like that in similar areas around the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and consistently uses olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and optional available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as "Sie" for the pronoun "ni", are written with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between certain verbs and objects.
According to some, it also makes it easier to read, although the need to figure out if a verb or adjective is in noun form makes the writing slightly more complicated.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also make sure to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means carriage.
The Persian language has relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, you can receive good help in learning a lot about Persian grammar and understanding sentences better if you read this basic grammar book.
It will naturally be easier for you to learn Portuguese if you already know a Romance language.
But people who know some Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
The old observatories are usually outdated today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution during their heyday was not the type of problem it is today, they are typically found in cities or university areas, easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are massive facilities located in remote places with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, or the viewing of cherry blossoms, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where they used plum blossoms.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so try to resist the temptation to remove "just one" specimen.
"If you visit an arranged garden, and you pick a "sample" it will also get you kicked out, without discussion."
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
But with its location in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also a smaller number of buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives rest.
Make sure that the bus you are considering taking goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inner waterways can be a good starting point to base a vacation around.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, Rhine Valley or take a boat trip to interesting cities on the Danube or a tour along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Many of the traditions around the weekend have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition to spend the Easter night awake at some open place to see the sunrise.
There are certainly Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may very well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening during Easter weekend. At midnight, the congregation then breaks up to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by either swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not make it across, and as a result, the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived on the Gal√°pagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctica during the winter, you will experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the Northern Lights, since the sky is dark more or less around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Suit is the normal business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing collective efforts rather than highlighting individual achievements.
Workers often need to get their superiors' approval for all decisions they make and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without hesitation.
