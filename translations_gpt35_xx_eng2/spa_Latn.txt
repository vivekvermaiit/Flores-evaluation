In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory already widespread, it also offers specific data that fossils generally do not provide, such as their color and their three-dimensional structure.
According to specialists, this animal has brown plumage on the upper area and a pale or carotenoid hue on the underside.
Likewise, the discovery allows for a better understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Given that the dinosaur plumage does not have a well-developed central shaft, called the rachis, but does present other features of feathers (bristles and barbs), researchers concluded that the rachis is likely the result of a later evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that its function was not related to flight, but that it was used to regulate temperature or as an indicator of it. Researchers argue that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed presents features of adult plumage and not of a chick.
The experts' appreciation was that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

Although it was mostly theoretical work, the program was designed to simulate the observations made on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The tidal forces between the dark matter present in the galaxy and that of the Milky Way would be what causes the expected effect by the group of scientists.
The Milky Way influences the Sagittarius galaxy in the same way that the moon exerts a force of attraction on our planet and causes tides.
The experts reached the conclusion that dark matter affects each other just like regular matter does.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is situated around it in a kind of halo and is composed of numerous small particles.

In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet indicating the candidate they have chosen into an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the person who is presenting to vote, he/she places the ballot in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law establishes procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes have to be transparent, which allows voters and observers to verify that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the voting and that no others are added that are not those of the voters, properly counted and authorized.
The candidates have the authority to send representatives to monitor each stage of the process and, during the night, volunteers tally the votes under strict supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

Through the use of infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), it was determined that the composition of the crystals coincides with that found in the urine of affected pets.
I don't know if they have noticed it or not, but most of the products from Central America arrived in this country tax-free.
Even so, the Central American countries levied tariffs on eighty percent of the products that we produce.
It seemed to me that that didn't make sense; it definitely wasn't fair.
The only thing I tell people is that you treat us the same way we treat you.
A bill was dictated by the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, which does not allow the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The bill provides that violent video games sold in the state of California must be labeled with a sticker with the legend "18" and penalizes their sale to minors with a fine of $1000 for non-compliance.
The Director of Public Prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning informing that Huhne and Pryce would be taken to trial.
Huhne has resigned, and Ed Davey MP will replace him in the cabinet. It is expected that Norman Lamb MP will take on the role of business minister that Davey is leaving vacant.
February 16th is the date on which Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear before the Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback, 25 and 21 years old, respectively, passed away. The latter was driving.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider required facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's gun jammed while aiming at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers from permanent pain, can't see with one of his eyes, is missing part of his skull, and his face had to be reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via a virtual link from a US Air Force base in his home country.
Carpanedo participated in two individual races of the championship apart from the competition on Wednesday.
The first race was slalom, in which he received a "Did Not Finish the first race", along with 36 out of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other career, giant slalom, she obtained the tenth place in the seated female group with a combined run time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes below the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four seated skiers failed to complete their races and a total of 45 out of 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not qualify for the race.
The police force of Madhya Pradesh was able to recover the stolen laptop and cell phone.
The Deputy Inspector General, D.K. Arya, declared: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to the police superintendent, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused presented themselves in court with their faces covered.
Despite there being three people inside the house at the time of the car impact, none of them suffered injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to his head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services removed the driver of the red Audi TT from inside.
At first, he was transferred to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then they transferred him to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh County Court, accused of the murder of her son.
While she is under custody awaiting indictment and trial, any statement from an eyewitness may be questionable, as her image has been widely publicized.
It is a common practice in other regions of the UK, but since the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
The professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee pointed out: "apparently, journalists are walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about the suspects".
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the prosecutions, told journalists that no further comments would be made until at least the indictment is issued.
According to the leaked information, the document will address the border conflict, which Palestine seeks to resolve based on the current boundaries prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that were also addressed, as reported, include the future status of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA only accepts five.
During the complementary pest control test, the rangers had to closely supervise the shooters, as their effectiveness was being monitored and evaluated.
Volunteers with the appropriate skills were recruited within the hunting program of the NSW Shooters' Association Inc., in a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW).
Mick O'Flynn, who is temporarily in charge of the Conservation and Heritage office of the NPWS Park, pointed out that comprehensive safety and training was provided to the four shooters chosen for the shooting operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, by its initials in English) of nine members.
In four years, it is the fifth CEP of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised that the previous CEP resign, as part of a series of measures aiming to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests that began in October against the regime.
The protests, sometimes violent, were sparked by the fact that elections have not been held in some cases since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods with malfunction and excessive heating have been reported, which caused six fires and resulted in minor burns for four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported having recorded 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company classified as "not serious".
The ministry spoke out about the delay in Apple's report, saying it was "truly regrettable".
Mariana was shaken by an earthquake at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.
The emergency management agency of the Northern Mariana Islands indicated that there were no reports of damage in the national territory.
Likewise, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, capital of the Philippines, a former police officer from that country hijacked a bus and held tourists coming from Hong Kong captive.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, it has been confirmed that at least six have died.
Both the six hostages, among whom there were children and elderly people, and the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an old woman because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was riddled with bullets.
Liggins followed the same path as his father and began studying medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and started working for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland around 1959.
Liggins began his research on premature birth in his spare time while working at the hospital.
His study showed that the fetal lung maturation of the baby could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators managed to recover the flight recorders from the black box.
The fighter companions of Luna also paid tribute to her.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first queen of the Extreme. She passed away on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Runnels, also known as Goldust, declared: "Luna was as rare as me; even more so. I love her and will miss her. I hope she is in a better place."
From 2008, among the 1400 surveyed prior to the 2010 federal elections, there was an 8% increase in those opposing Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, interim prime minister, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic once Queen Elizabeth II's term is over.
34% of those surveyed share this vision and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
At one end of the survey, 29% of people believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; at the other end, 31% believe it should never do so.
The Olympic gold medal winner was supposed to swim in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been called into question following his complaints.
He has not been able to take medication to relieve the pain, because its use is prohibited in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the discovery using various types of hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Possibly, comets have served as a source of water supply for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the ability to form proteins and sustain life.
The scientists' expectation is to understand how planets, especially our own, originate, given that comets crashed into Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor at the beginning of the year and last month signed a bill allowing people of the same sex to marry.
He dismissed the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for the presidential elections in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce air route distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast to the old ground radar technology, in order to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate data to pilots.
Additional transportation will not be implemented and the trains will not stop at Wembley. Car parking and the park-and-ride will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transportation, the possibility of the game taking place behind closed doors, without the team's fans, was considered.
On Thursday, the magazine Science revealed research reporting the appearance of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos islands.
Experts from Princeton University in the USA, and from Uppsala University in Sweden, revealed that the new species managed to evolve in just two generations, even though it was estimated that it would take much longer, due to the breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and a migrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take on all kinds of shapes and be rolled into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it can also be stretched into a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can become very thin and adhere to another metal. Such is the thinness that it was used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the chemical product analyzed determines its pH level.
The hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Therefore, a hydrogen ion is the result of stripping a proton of its electron.
Shake both dry powders together and, after doing so, with clean and damp hands, squeeze them to form a ball.
There will be a reaction between the moisture in your hands and their outer layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, which were connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
In some households in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewer systems were found.
They also had bathrooms in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is thousands of miles away, they are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, since the Earth's atmospheric light distorts part of the light and sight that we have.
A giant rocket of over 100 feet in height is needed to be able to carry a satellite or telescope into outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The most relevant thing it has done for us was to provide us with much simpler and faster transportation.
Thanks to her today we have many means of transportation, such as the railway or the automobile, among many others.
Below, there are smaller-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including independent domestic cats) that feed on small species that exist in much larger numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche: each feline has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the felines that socialize the most, and their life takes place within large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males from the same family group, joined with up to thirty females and their offspring.
Generally, females are closely related to each other, making them a big family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides have the same behavior as that of wolves or dogs, with whom they share a surprising resemblance (unlike other big cats) both in their behavior and in being highly lethal to their prey.
The tiger has the ability to climb (but not too well), swim, make long jumps, and pull five times stronger than a robust person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four felines capable of emitting roars.
The tiger's roar is not fully as loud as the lion's, but rather like a prayer of words spoken in growls and screams.
The ocelots enjoy feeding on small creatures. When possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all of their prey will be much smaller in size than them.
The scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) through their sense of smell, scenting the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places, and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main one they come from (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily go back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they used to be accustomed to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, and therefore, a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it had before to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still require the same adaptations as in the past.
Over time, as the burgeoning population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that it will not be possible to classify them as the same species.
This process is known as speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inevitable consequence and fundamental part of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale.
The plants' food is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. In addition, they provide us with shade.
We build our houses using plants and we also use them to make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, therefore, it feared nothing except others of its own kind.
Its long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth embedded like razor blades, in addition to another additional group on the palate, which means that anything that passed in front of it had no escape.
We do not have certainty, but it could have had the viperine. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it could have even been a cannibal.
It also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a dinosaur as huge as the T. Rex was a threat to it.
Although most of that food would be quite familiar to us, the Romans also ate certain unconventional items at banquets, such as boars, peacocks, snails, and even a type of rodent, the dormouse.
Another thing in which they differed was that the humble people and women ate sitting in a chair, while the wealthy enjoyed sharing banquets and reclining while they ate.
It is not possible that the recipes of ancient Rome included foods that reached Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple for each of their gods considered their home.
The people brought sacrifices for the gods and the priests sought to fulfill their needs by celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
On some occasions, special pyramidal-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top part of the tower constituted a special sanctuary for its deity.
In the middle of the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not of great importance.
The Hebrew families spent most of their time outdoors.
The women used to cook in the patio; the shops were just counters that faced the street. The houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests; therefore, wood was extremely expensive.
Very few inhabitants lived in Greenland. According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey he undertook further to the west, he discovered the island and gave it its name.
Even so, regardless of their discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already inhabiting the place by then.
Although each country separately was "Scandinavian," there were marked differences in relation to the people, the monarchs, the habits, and the history among Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you may believe that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. While the reverse side of the document contains some writing, it is not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence has written on the back the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text is located at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that as soon as it was made, the huge parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation was added only as a label.
Although the landings carried out during D-Day, as well as the subsequent confrontations, had achieved the liberation of northern France, the southern side still remained.
His government was in the hands of the French from "Vichy", who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed to peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the so-called "Operation Dragoon" was deployed, through which the Allies invaded southern France.
In just two weeks, the American forces and those of Free France had managed to liberate the south of France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture of which an extensive group of people who live and work together is part; that is, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related to both the word civis, from the same language, which means citizen, and civitas, whose meaning is city or state city and which also determines in some way the size of the society.
The city-states are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization involves a prolonged intergenerational transmission of knowledge, a lasting cultural legacy, and a homogeneous spread.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and they fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the congress was its only component.
The Congress did not have the authority to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial power, this function fell to the state authorities, who often did not cooperate in enforcing all their laws.
He was also not authorized to annul tax laws or tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all states to proceed with their amendment, and the states paid so little attention to the central government that their representatives often were absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German team, is the second team with the most victories in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most practiced sports are soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with athletes participating in international tournaments and Olympic events.
In Japan there are about 7000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing through the area recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, that is, beautiful island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiated a transformation in the indigenous method of grain production, with the use of Chinese labor to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing dynasty army (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared it a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government adheres to the Shimonoseki Treaty, through which it cedes sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, who retains control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main constructions: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been reconstructed so that tourists can see how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had already been restored, and work continues to this day.
To illustrate, the most common format for still image photography globally is 35mm, which was the most widely used film size towards the end of the analog film era.
Nowadays it is still being produced, but the most important thing is that its dimensional relationship has been transferred to the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Truly, the 35mm format is somewhat confusing, as its measurements are 36mm in width by 24mm in height.
Therefore it is said that the dimensional ratio of this format (dividing by twelve in order to calculate the simplest whole number ratio) is equivalent to 3:2.
Many typical formats (for example, the group of APS formats) are the same or very similar to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant jokes and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that generates dynamism while allowing for some order in the images.
Indicate that the most effective position to place the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had managed to unite the European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the common people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are reserved for that specific purpose.
The central dome of the church had remained in Rome for over a millennium and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the strategy, which involved the disruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, such action violated the generally recognized international law as contemplated in various international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain extracted international waters in entire sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, putting even neutral vessels at risk.
Having received a limited response against this tactic, Germany thought to encounter a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during the First World War, countries wanted to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the USA in order to take a job at the Edison company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a recommendation letter written by Charles Batchelor (his manager at his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delineating different periods of time. Each stage or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with divided provinces. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a fierce war broke out between many nobles vying for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was that of The Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle to occupy the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
Its political and social consequences are numerous, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
Likewise, after the Revolution, positions were open to all male candidates, allowing the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same thing happens with the military, since, instead of basing the army ranks on classes, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other people of the repressed working class in other countries to face their own revolutions.
Mahoma was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which endured over time, vividly illustrates Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
At the peak of one of the mountains north of Mecca lies a cave completely secluded from the rest of the planet.
Indeed, it is very difficult to find, even if one were sure of its existence. Inside the cave, the isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen except the marvelous clear sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. From inside this cave, one can see or hear very little of this world.
The only one that still stands is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century B.C., is one of the many large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Kings, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many others like it, smaller tombs and temples were erected in honor of his wives and relatives.
The "upward bow" mark resembles a V and the "downward bow" mark is similar to a staple or a square without its bottom edge.
Up means starting at the tip and pushing the bow, and down means starting at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pulling it.
The upward movement of the bow generates a softer sound, whereas a downward one is stronger and sharper.
Feel free to make your own marks with a pencil, but do not forget that the marks on the bowing instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and therefore should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced the terrified monarch Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged eleven, and Louis Charles, aged four), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that was shouting and throwing threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to fully open the windows of their carriage.
At some point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of a royal guard executed in Versailles in front of the panicked queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid for the war expenses of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the US in order to cover most of the expenses and interests of the bonds that were floated in the name of the Filipino government in the banks of Wall Street.
From now on, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the main gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the establishment of the order.
The European historical period in which these events take place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, between the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (that is, between the years 1000 and 1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that pragmatically encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological drive or imperative to a strict sense that there is an underlying logic driving the destiny of humanity and that is related to the laws of science and how they are manifested in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development itself unfolds along a path independent of any cultural or political influence and, at the same time, that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national network of highways is not economically feasible for a low volume of cars, so new manufacturing techniques are being designed to reduce the costs of owning a vehicle.
The massive use of automobiles also generates a higher incidence of traffic accidents, leading to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in Romanticism, according to scholars like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography developed, which, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital today, Constantinople was considered as such in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 B.C and extended until around 1100 A.D.
During the 12th century its status declined, mainly because the crusaders brought back gifts, such as silks and spices, which were given more value than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "fashion capital" was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of Gothic style took place between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At first, the way of dressing received great influence from the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slowness of communication channels, Western styles may be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their garments.
Subsistence agriculture is understood as that whose objective is to produce enough food to exclusively meet the needs of the farmer and his family group.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, generally organic practice that combines the use of locally originated stored seeds with crop rotation or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, a large part of the main activity of farmers was subsistence agriculture, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization by social standards and provide them with the possibility of generating a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location, or gender of its members.
The traits that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or related to religion or politics, or a mix of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to display traits of belonging through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, such as fashion, gestures, and slang.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms for graphing the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
These children are nicknamed "wild ones". Some wild children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, a child's abandonment is due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
It's possible that the feral children may have suffered traumatic situations or severe child abuse before being abandoned or running away.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived on their own in the wild.
When the feral child is raised exclusively by animals other than humans, they exhibit behaviors (within their physical capabilities) almost identical to those of the specific animal that cared for them, as well as fear or indifference towards people.
Even though project-based learning should facilitate that process and make it more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; rather, it is an assistance that provides support for those undergoing a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in both real and virtual format; in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold, but so is the small animated paperclip from Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are incorporated into the software and their function is to question, stimulate, or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student on their own.
Children are placed in foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up, ever, in an environment where there is no love, care and education; but it happens.
We can perceive that the foster care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The objective of our foster care system is to offer safe homes, loving caregivers, sustained education, and reliable medical assistance.
The goal of foster care is to meet all the needs that were not being addressed in the previous home they were taken from.
Internet brings together and blends components of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The different features that the Internet presents open the way to new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are identified as significant incentives for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
During a study of user reactions to websites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), "personal involvement" and "lasting relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important findings have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that, through the proper reading of their microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," explained how those who cannot comprehend speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that the skills to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, it has been proven that there are two groups of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the selection process removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variation from one generation to another.
In the savanna, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to humans, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
Furthermore, not doing so leads to serious problems: growth slowdown, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The proteins present in leaves and legumes would have constituted the most easily accessible plant resources, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest while providing a large number of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
Ultimately, it should not surprise us if our own predecessors solved their "protein problems" in the same way as savanna chimpanzees do today.
The interruption of sleep consists of intentionally waking up during the normal sleep period and falling asleep again after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a more or less gentle alarm clock that brings him back to a conscious state, though without fully waking him up.
The registry is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with local authorities.
Other options based on biological rhythm consist of drinking plenty of liquids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before going to bed, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the life force we have. Each one of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all achieve enlightenment. The only thing that obstructs the path is our tension and negativity.
While the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they spread along the path of Mahayana love and numerous techniques of yoga from India.
In general terms, laism is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is activated with yoga positions, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on Devata Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, the energy channels can be unblocked, the chakras activated, and the awareness of enlightenment developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. After the war, clashes of system, process, and culture ended up distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would spread over the next 40 years and would truly be fought, through surrogate militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Due to the fact that by September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, their only hope was to retreat and reorganize in the Romanian bridgehead extension.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 fighters from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
Since forever, the role of the Navy has been to ensure that its country retains the ability to transport its population and goods, while also interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The North Atlantic Campaign in World War II offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were attempting to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean in order to support Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using submarines, tried to cancel out this circulation.
If the Allies had not been successful, Germany could have taken power in Great Britain, just as it did in the other European countries.
Apparently, goats were domesticated, for the first time, about 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros mountains, in Iran.
With the purpose of easily obtaining their milk, fur, meat, and leather, ancient towns and tribes began to keep them.
Generally, domestic goats were gathered in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the most popular shepherd. These herding methods are still used today.
In England, the train tracks had already been installed by the 16th century.
Even though the rails of the cars were made of simple parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve greater speed and pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
The incorporation of sleepers to keep the rails in place occurred quite early. However, gradually, they realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron on their upper part.
It became a common practice, although the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with others made of iron and, in 1767, solid iron rails began to be used.
The first form of transportation that was known was walking. Human beings began to do it in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
While traces of bipedalism have been found in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can start leading a more planet-friendly life, become part of environmental movements, or even become activists and fight to reduce, to some extent, future suffering.
It is, in many cases, like asymptomatic treatment. But if we are not only looking for a temporary situation, we should find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is evident that the world has undergone great changes, as a result of the technological and scientific advancements of humanity, and problems have intensified due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few streets away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are currently known as the "Dunlap Copies."
It was John Nixon who first read the document, and he did it in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it to be read to his army in New York on July 9. Another copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. They are the birds.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs, since they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still make them similar to dinosaurs.
They have scaly limbs and claws, lay eggs, and move on their hind legs just like the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers operate based on the manipulation of data encoded under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, which are 0 and 1 and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be evident immediately. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning can be found with an open bottle of medicines or toxic chemical cleaning products.
Read the label to have specific information about the first aid relevant to that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term parasitic insect in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its ancient relationship with bedbugs, a species highly developed for parasitizing humans.
The assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
The registered cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the US amount to about 400,000, making it the most frequent neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve, is the target of attack in multiple sclerosis.
The studies indicated that women are twice as likely as men to suffer from MS.
A couple could conclude that raising a baby would not be the most convenient for them or the child.
These couples could choose to plan the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The primary goal of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for most scientific research.
It is not, however, an experimentation, it is a test used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, by asking questions and making observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was on the classical works; especially on the Latin version of the biblical text.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially the questions of science, even psychology, were accepted.
As the mastery of the Greek language declined, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots, both philosophical and scientific.
Many rhythms present in physiological processes and behavior often depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate self-sustainably and have a free cyclic functioning period, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA consisted of genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacteria using phages, or viruses.
They carried out two experiments in which they labeled the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether it involves germline cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while those that occur in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism tends to attract people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and plant life.
Some possible activities at the location include: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
An example is visiting, taking photos, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs and often encounter others whose jobs are in the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle system, everyone is somehow connected to and supported by a transportation system based on the use of private cars.
Currently, scientists maintain that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humanity for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems; and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
What is the reason that transportation systems give rise to complaints of such magnitude and why do failures occur daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial happening?
The traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is not a simple task, since it is not possible to make exact predictions about the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency among drivers to maintain relatively consistent behavior, allowing traffic flows to have logical consistency and be subject to approximate mathematical representation.
In order to graph the flow of circulation more clearly, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
Such relationships facilitate both planning and design as well as the operations of traffic devices.
The first species to take flight were insects. This helped them evade their enemies more easily and find food and mating partners more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backward, sticking them to the sides of their bodies.
This provides them with a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects unable to fold their wings.
Millenniums ago, a man named Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited around the Earth, including the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since we do not perceive its movement on Earth, right?
The Amazon River is the most abundant and the second longest on the planet. It contains 8 times more water than the river that follows it in size.
Besides, the Amazon is the widest river on the planet, in some points with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total water from the world's rivers that flows into the oceans, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they were never able to surpass those of Giza, neither in size nor in the sublimity of the technique of their construction.
The ancient Egyptian village of the New Empire was amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time dated back over a millennium.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and has the lowest population.
The Italian language is used in the Vatican City, both for drafting its norms and issuing its official communications.
The language spoken daily by most of those who work within the state is also Italian, and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
The entirety of the citizens living in the Vatican City adhere to the Roman Catholic religion.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known since ancient times, since all of them can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything is formed by a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It had greater resemblance to the states of matter (with identical order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, but at the same time, it had the theory that they transform into new substances that make up the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also precious metals like gold and silver.
There may also be alloys with small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of small particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively tiny that the period at the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
The pencil gained many friends when it was invented.
Unfortunately, due to the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Nowadays, people write messages on the screens of their computers. They don't even need to approach a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer arises.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when rolling a heavy car uphill. By splitting the core once again, it releases some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, meaning they tend to break down with minimal or no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
She is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more seas on the near side because its crust is thinner, which facilitated the ascent of lava to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what attracts or appeals to people.
These doctrines maintain that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew up to reach maturity.
These theories analyze what causes certain people to want the things they do and what factors in their environment compel them to do or not do certain things.
Two well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two types of behavior can occur when managers start leading their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum, there is the attempt to continue being "one of the guys" (or girls).
Managers in this category have a hard time making decisions that are unpopular with employees, implementing disciplinary measures, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding staff accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, he becomes an unrecognizable person who believes it is necessary to change everything that the group has been doing so far and do it his way.
At the end of the day, the ultimate responsible for the success and failure of the team is the leader.
This way of behaving often ends up distancing leaders from other members of the team.
The same standards of excellence that conventional teams adhere to also apply to virtual ones, although there are small differences.
Often, members of a virtual team operate as the point of contact for their closest physical group.
Generally, they enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, thanks to their teams being able to meet according to different time zones that, for example, may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) also constitutes an exclusive element of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports. It is the one that establishes the standards for each member.
What reason could an organization have to undergo the demanding process of establishing a learning organization? One of the purposes of applying the theoretical concepts of organizational learning is to drive innovation.
When all available resources are used properly in the operational departments of an organization, space for creativity and ingenuity is generated.
As a result, it is possible that the process of an organization working as a team to overcome a difficulty leads to a new innovative process in order to meet the needs of the clients.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must first create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous improvement approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide factual evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They thus narrow the field of research and confer greater accuracy.
The existing correlation between brain pathology and behavior contributes to the research of scientists.
For a long time it has been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we have the opportunity to see and investigate structures and processes that occur in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with abundant information and material to develop simulation models, which enhance our understanding of mental processes.
While artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a highly relevant specialty within computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in the field of AI involves the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are, among others, monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and inquiries, as well as facial, handwriting, and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-life problems.
The Artificial Intelligence system is now often used in the sectors of the economy, medicine, engineering, and the military, just as it has been incorporated into various software applications for video games and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of every classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take their students to sites that are not reachable by bus.
The solution comes through technology, by means of virtual field trips. Students can observe objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual tour is also an excellent way to reflect on an outing and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students from Bennet school in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State capital, and every year the website gets updated, but previous versions are kept online in the form of a memory album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Even though students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, this generally changes in the presence of an audience.
Due to the fact that students are often the most critical readers, the blog writer begins to make an effort to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
Likewise, blogging "requires students to be more understanding of the world around them." The need to capture the audience's interest inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The proper use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through active response to internet content, they can define their positions in the context of others' writings, as well as establish their perspectives on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a variety of museums and art galleries that showcase the country's history and present day.
The Niagara Falls are further south and to the north is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and the surrounding area.
All these aspects, among others, are what stand out Ontario as intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas further to the north are sparsely populated, and some are wild, nearly uninhabited lands.
In the United States, there are more African Americans than Canadians, which surprises many people when comparing populations.
The location of the islands of East Africa is off the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury resorts.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and was imposed, to a large extent, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial starting point of European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route that connects the Cape of Good Hope with India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is advised that all female visitors claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be resolute in rejecting men and do not be afraid to defend your stance (cultural differences or not, that is not okay!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century B.C. and it was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of Casa Branca, but in 1755 they abandoned it after an earthquake occurred.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who set up their businesses in that place called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in all of Morocco to go shopping.
In the surroundings of the old Medina, there are plenty of places where traditional Moroccan items are sold, such as clay pots, ceramics, leather products, water pipes, and a whole range of trinkets, although everything is prepared for tourists.
Goma is a tourist spot in the Democratic Republic of Congo, on the eastern border, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the city center.
While Goma is fairly safe, any visits outside should be considered in order to be aware of the situation of the ongoing clashes in North Kivu province.
At the same time, the city is the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and its mountain gorilla sightseeing tours are among the most affordable in Africa.
To move around Goma, you can choose to take a boda-boda (mototaxi). The regular (local) fare is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, together with the fact that it is relatively inaccessible, has given "Timbuktu" an image of an exotic and distant land.
Although today Timbuktu is a impoverished city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops on Henry Louis Gates' African World Wonders special on PBS.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arabic style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as the main icon of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all natural reserves in South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and park access.
It may also be convenient to purchase a Wild Card that allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the homonymous island, which is considered the main attraction by many tourists.
The deployment of buildings that delimit the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a luminous bar chart that is evidenced by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront, located across from it.
It is in the reclaimed lands of the northern coast of Hong Kong where its urban development is densely concentrated.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you want to see evidence of the colonial past of this region, it is a convenient place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast inland of Bangladesh and India.
The UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The portion of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Without prejudice, the forests are not only mangroves, but they also possess some of the last remaining trees from the impressive jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans comprises an area of 3850 km2 and about a third of its extent is covered by water or swampy areas.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a temple of wildlife and it is estimated that there are currently 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses depart from the inter-district station (across the river) throughout the day, although most of them, especially those traveling to the east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 am.
Due to the fact that inter-district buses are often full of passengers, it is recommended to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Almost all districts have the Japanese Coaster bus service, which is comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi ride is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River bridge is a cable-stayed structure that crosses it, connecting Oiapoque, a Brazilian city, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m wide.
Under the bridge there is a clearance of 15 meters, and although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is when the Brazilian customs checks are expected to be completed.
The area that currently makes up the eastern part of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and lived as semi-nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region housed other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered, and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The giant province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began the colonization stage, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous idiosyncrasy and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and the best players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Other tournaments and lower division matches can also be witnessed in other parts of the year.
At the site of the Argentine Polo Association, you will find information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The value of the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed in equivalence with the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. There you can exchange your money. It is in front of the FIC West store, in Stanley.
Sterling pounds are usually accepted anywhere within the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
There is a possibility that credit cards may not be accepted on the peripheral islands, but you may be able to use British or American currency. Ask the owners in advance to determine the accepted method of payment.
It is practically impossible to exchange money from the Falkland Islands outside of the archipelago, so try to do it before leaving.
Due to Montevideo being located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30° C during the summer.
The winter cold can be deceiving: while it is very rare for temperatures to drop below freezing, the wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specifically "rainy" or "dry" seasons; the amount of rain remains almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild, so you should not feed or disturb them.
According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from other wild animals.
Despite how docile they may appear, the truth is that bison, tapirs, moose, bears, and practically all large animals can be aggressive.
Dozens of visitors suffer injuries each year for not maintaining a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous; therefore, please respect their space.
Likewise, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so you should avoid having or cooking foods that give off a strong aroma and keep the campsite clean.
Capital of Samoa, the city of Apia is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Around two hundred American and German individuals died.
During the war for independence that the Mau movement faced, a peaceful encounter in the city resulted in the assassination of the head of state Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a large number of beaches, because Auckland has two ports. The most well-known are located in three areas.
In the district of North Harbour, in the Pacific Ocean, the beaches of North Shore are located, spanning from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are mostly sandy with safe swimming spots and mostly have pohutukawa trees that offer shady areas.
At the Waitemataas port, the beaches of Tamaki Drive unfold, in the extravagant neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available on the coast. They are also safe for swimming.
Number One is the most popular local beer and it is not complex, but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other regional beer is Manta.
While there is a wide variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia could be considered better for transporting.
The local tap water is completely safe for consumption, but if you are worried, you can easily find bottled water.
The Australians consider the concept of "flat white" coffee to be foreign. A small black coffee is called "espresso", cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam), and tea is not taken with milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many trips are made to the reef throughout the year, and there, injuries from any of these causes are rare.
Anyway, accept the advice of the authorities, respect all signs and pay special attention to security alerts.
The cubozoans are located near the beaches and river estuaries from October to April, north of 1770. Occasionally, they can be found outside of this time.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most of them are afraid of humans and would swim away.
The ocean is not the place where saltwater crocodiles actively reside. Their primary habitat is the river estuaries located north of Rockhampton.
Making a lodging reservation in advance of your trip gives you the peace of mind that you will have a place to stay when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, although it is also possible to book other types of accommodation through them, such as camping areas.
Generally, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even combined packages of flights and accommodation.
They can also hold the reservation for you in case you need more time to consider the offer, or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as the visa, for example).
However, any modification or request must be made through the travel agent first, and not directly through the hotel.
At some festivals, most of those who attend the musical events decide to camp at the venue and the majority of the audience considers it a crucial aspect of the experience.
If you want to get up close to the action, then you should arrive early at the camp to secure a spot near the musical events.
It should be noted that, while the musical performances may have ended, in other areas of the festival they could continue until the early hours of the morning.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.

Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or mountain passes should anticipate the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or low temperatures.
On roads with ice or snow, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as you would on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, a large amount of snow can fall, leaving you trapped in a very short amount of time.
Furthermore, visibility can be reduced by snowfall or by condensation or ice forming on the car windows.
On the other hand, in many countries ice and snow conditions are normal and traffic flows almost without any interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are likely to be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable part for many visitors.
The popular use of the term safari refers to land trips to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, usually approach vehicles and standard equipment will make good visibility possible.
At times, lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be shy, so you will have more opportunities to observe them using binoculars.

Ironing clothes when they are still damp can help to dry them. Many hotels have an iron and a board to lend to travelers, even if one is not easily found in the room.
If you don't have an iron available, or if you don't want to use ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if it's available.
Try not to let the fabric get too hot, as it could shrink or, in extreme cases, burn.
Different methods are known for purifying water, some more effectively targeting specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in others, several more minutes are necessary.
Not all filters have the same effectiveness and, if this concerns you, you should consider buying bottled water with a certified company seal.
Travelers may encounter animal plagues of which they have no knowledge in the regions from which they come.
Pests are capable of ruining food, causing irritation, or, in more serious cases, causing allergic reactions, spreading poison, or transmitting infections.
Infectious diseases, by themselves, or dangerous animals, that can harm or kill individuals through the use of their strength, are not usually included in the category of pests.
The duty-free purchase offers an opportunity to acquire, in certain places, products exempt from taxes and consumption taxes.

On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging driving conditions and frequently travels through remote and solitary terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, stay alert: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The established speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and following sections, generally 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h), and their strict compliance is even more important than in any other section.
However, surprisingly, the cellphone signal is much better here than in many other sections of the road like Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German pastry shop is of good quality, and in Bavaria, the cakes are quite tasty and varied, similar to those prepared in Austria, their neighbor to the south.
Fruit cakes are common, with cooked apples inside throughout the year and cherries and plums that appear in the summer.
Many of the German products prepared in the oven also have almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. In general, popular cakes make an excellent combination with a cup of strong coffee.
If you are craving small but tasty pastries, try the Berliner, also called Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a recipe made with herbs and spices and served with meat or vegetables.

The stirrups are the supports for the riders' feet that hang on both sides of the saddle.
While they provide greater stability to the rider, they may present safety problems, as it is possible for their feet to get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from the horse, but their foot remains stuck in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the animal runs away. To reduce the risk, there are a series of safety precautions.
First of all, most riders use riding boots with a heel that has a smooth and quite narrow sole.
In addition, there are stirrups, especially English ones, with safety bars that allow the leather of the stirrup to detach from its structure if a rider who is thrown off pulls backwards.
The Cochamó Valley is the most popular climbing destination in Chile and is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of extensive granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks also offer stunning views from the summits. Climbers from all corners of the globe constantly chart new paths among their walls of infinite potential.
Snow sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular disciplines that consist of sliding with skis or a board attached to the feet on snowy terrain.
Skiing is a main travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski lovers," who organize their vacations completely based on skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very ancient, as there are cave paintings that depict skiers dating back to around 5000 BC.
As a discipline, alpine skiing dates back to no later than the 17th century. In 1861, Norwegians inaugurated the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Ski backpacking: also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
While they are related, it generally does not involve practicing cross-country skiing or alpine mountaineering, developed on steep slopes with much stiffer skis and footwear.
Imagine the ski slope as a hiking trail.
Under satisfactory conditions, it will be able to travel slightly longer distances than if done on foot, but it will very rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a well-weighted backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to manage visa requests and passport controls multiple times.
However, the Schengen area functions as a single country in this regard.
Generally, whenever you move within this region, you will be able to cross the borders without going through a passport control checkpoint again.
In the same way, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to manage permits for each of the member countries of this area separately. This will save you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal criteria that determines when a manufactured good can be considered an antique. Some tax agencies have established that objects over 100 years old are considered antiques.
The definition varies geographically, where the age limit could be more restricted in places like North America than in Europe.
It may happen that handcrafted products are classified as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
The breeding of reindeer constitutes a fundamental means of livelihood among the Lapps and the culture related to that commercial activity is important for many dedicated to other professions.
However, even traditionally, not all the Lapps have been dedicated to large-scale reindeer breeding, but lived off fishing, hunting, and other similar activities, using reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi people work in modern commercial activities. Tourism represents an important income in Lapland, the Sámi region.

Transgender individuals who have not yet had surgery should not expect to go through scanners with their dignity and privacy intact.
The return currents are the flow that retreats from the waves breaking on the shore, often on a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow converges in certain areas of greater depth and there a fast current can originate towards deeper waters.
Most of the deaths occur due to fatigue caused by trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once I manage to escape from the current, swimming back will not be more complex than usual.
Try to make it to a place where it can't reach you again, or if you have the skills and someone has seen you, it might be convenient to wait to be rescued.
The impact of returning home occurs before the cultural (there is no "honeymoon" period of happiness), takes longer to go away, and can be tougher.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes have a lot of difficulties adapting back to their native culture.
When you return to your home after residing abroad, you will have adapted to that new culture and will have lost some of the habits of your native culture.
When you traveled abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
People may not anticipate that tolerance and understanding are also necessary for returning travelers in their homes.
The light show and the pyramid sound are one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
In the darkness, the pyramids can be seen and contemplated in silence before the show begins.

Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where there is a spectacular natural harbor formed by the flooded caldera of an active volcano.
The Ellsworth Land, whose boundaries are defined by the Bellingshausen Sea, is a region located south of the peninsula.
In this place, the mountains of the Peninsula mix with the plateau and then re-emerge to form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern sector, Sentinel Range, the highest peaks of Antarctica are located, the Vinson Massif, with a summit at 4892 meters on Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, where cell phone coverage is not available, a satellite device could be your only option.
A satellite phone cannot be equated to a mobile phone, because, in order to make a call, one must be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to the satellite.
The service is often used in water transport, including recreational boats, as well as for expeditions that require remote data and voice.
You can consult with your local phone service provider for more information on how to sign up for this service.
Combining travel and learning has become a very popular option among those who plan to take a sabbatical year.
This is very popular among high school graduates, as it allows them to take a gap year before college without risking their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a study abroad program during a sabbatical year can indeed increase the chances of accessing higher education once you return to your country of origin.
Normally, a registration fee will be charged to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for sailing: the "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
Not always a yacht is necessary in the archipelagos and lakes.
While coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are spacious enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak provide a different experience.
Sailing is a recreational activity at a national level in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
The same happens in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but apart from that, it's quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands the ratio is one in every forty).
Most exclusive cruises that travel through the Baltic Sea include a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you have the possibility of making a visit to the historic city for a few whole days during your return trip, sleeping on the boat at night.
If you only disembark during shore excursions, it is not necessary to have a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. However, as seen on the map above, the city is not located near the sea and its visit is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can generate fear in people of any age and place, particularly if they have never gone through the experience or have lived through a traumatic situation.
You should not feel ashamed of it: in no way is it different from other types of personal fears and dislikes that afflict so many others.
For some, understanding a little bit about how airplanes operate and what happens during a flight can make it easier to leave behind a fear that stems from a lack of knowledge or a feeling of not being in control.
Messenger companies are paid very well for making fast deliveries. Often, time is very important when it comes to commercial documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
Large companies have their own planes on some routes, but there was a problem for smaller companies and other routes.
If they made a shipment by air freight, in some routes it may have been delayed for days in unloading and customs.
The only option to make it faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations prohibit transporting luggage without a passenger, and this is where you come into play.
The obvious way to travel in first class or business class on a plane is to spend a fortune for that privilege (or, better yet, have your company pay for you).
But this comes at a price: generally speaking, you can end up paying up to four times the economy fare in business class and up to eleven times in first class.
Generally, it is a waste of time to look for discounts for first class or business class seats on direct flights.
Airline companies are well aware that there is a core group of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to a place quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. Its regional language is Romanian, although Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a republic composed of many ethnicities, among which conflicts of that nature have arisen.
In 1994, this conflict led to the formation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria, east of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but which no UN member state recognizes.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic ties have been reestablished between the two parts of Moldova.
Orthodox Christianity is the majority religion in Moldova.

It is a tradition to spend Easter night awake in some exposed place to contemplate the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations of this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
The most traditional churches usually offer an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, and generally, congregations begin the celebrations for the resurrection of Christ as soon as midnight arrives.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came to this place swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to being very far from the continent, mammals were unable to reach there, which made the giant tortoise become the main grazing creature in the Galapagos.
Many mammal species have been introduced to Galapagos since humans arrived to the archipelago, such as goats, horses, cattle, rodents, dogs and cats.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic regions during the winter, you will experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
