In addition to proving that at least some dinosaurs had feathers - a widely held theory - it allows us to see details that are not usually visible in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the animal's feathers were chestnut brown and its underside light or yellowish-red.
The finding allows us to take a look at the evolution of bird feathers.
As dinosaur feathers do not have a developed feather shaft, called a rachis, but do have other parts of the feathers - the feather barb and the downy base of the feather vane - scientists concluded that the feather shaft likely evolved later from the remaining parts.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flying, but rather for regulating or displaying temperature. Researchers suggested that the specimen is an example of adult plumage, not down feathers of a chick, although it is a young dinosaur's tail.
Scientists assumed that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult feathers, not fledgling down feathers.
Yesterday morning in Turkey, the car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to stimulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts gravitational pull on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a halo, and it consists of many small particles.

Dr Tony Moll discovered an extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new strain "seriously worries with its high mortality rate and causes anxiety."

In France, voting has traditionally been a technology-free experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put a pre-printed paper with the chosen candidate's name in an envelope.
After officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The processing rules of the French electoral law are quite strictly regulated in the legislation.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes in the box at the beginning of the voting and that no other envelopes are added there, except those properly accounted for and added by eligible voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific instructions.

In the women's starting group, four skiers did not finish, and out of 117 giant slalom participants, 45 did not finish the race.
The police in Madhya Pradesh got back the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five individuals who raped the Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
When the car hit the building, there were three people inside, but none of them were injured.
The driver still suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed until the rescue service freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
Originally, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth for medical treatment.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been accused in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court of murdering his son.
He has been arrested until the presentation of the charges and the trial, but any eyewitness testimonies may be of questionable value, as his image has been published in many places.
In the rest of the UK, it is a common practice, but in Scotland, the administration of justice works differently and the courts consider the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee noted that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line when they publish photos of suspects, etc."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for the charges, has made it clear to journalists that no further comments will be given at least until the charges are brought.
According to the leak, the document refers to a border dispute in which Palestine wishes it to be based on the pre-1967 border prior to the Middle East war.
Among the other topics discussed were the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred for both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that there would be a military presence secured in the valley for ten years after signing the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to leave the military presence for only five years.
Shooters participating in the additional pest control trial were closely monitored by forest rangers because the trial was under observation and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
Qualified volunteers were recruited for the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the NSW Shooting Association's company's society based on the shooting association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NPWS park protection and cultural heritage, the four shooters chosen for the first shooting operation received thorough safety instructions and training.
Martelly swore in a new temporary electoral council consisting of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended that the previous acting president resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread regime opposition protests that began in October.
The motivation for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to organize elections, which some had been waiting for since 2011.
It has been reported about approximately 60 cases of iPod malfunction due to overheating, resulting in six fires and causing minor burns to four people in total.
According to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan, there were 27 accidents related to equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple has notified them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
"The ministry referred to Apple's postponement of the report as "truly regrettable"."
An earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT) on Friday evening.
The Crisis Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands said that there were no reports of any damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there are no indications of a tsunami forming.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in the capital city of Manila in the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle towards the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and in at least six cases, it has been confirmed that they are dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released earlier along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady who needed to use the toilet. Mendoza was made harmless by shooting.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He studied to become an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
During that time when Liggins worked at the hospital, he began researching premature birth in his free time.
His studies showed that when a certain hormone is administered to the fetus, it accelerates the development of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators retrieved two aircraft black boxes' cockpit voice recordings on Wednesday.
Wrestling colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna left us on a night two months ago. Quite unique, just like her. Strong woman."
"Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels commented that ""Luna was as weird as me... maybe even weirder... love her and miss her... hopefully she is in a better place now."
The number of people who are against the Australian republicanism increased by 8 percent compared to 2008, out of 1400 people who were surveyed before the 2010 federal elections.
Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that in her opinion, Queen Elizabeth II should become the republic of Australia when her reign ends.
34 percent of the survey participants agree, wishing for Queen Elizabeth II to remain Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the results, 29% of the respondents believe that Australia should become a republic at the first opportunity, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to participate in the Commonwealth Games in the 100m and 200m freestyle swimming events and in three relay races, but due to complaints, his readiness is now in question.
He has not been able to take the medication he needs to overcome the pain because they are prohibited at the Olympic Games.
Mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, Curtis Cooper, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25th.
How many people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets supplied the Earth with water, along with organic materials, which were able to form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, as comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed the law legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors political gossip and nonsense.
The speculation is that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
Instead of the older ground-based radar technology, it uses satellite-based technology, which allows air traffic controllers to more accurately determine and provide pilots with more precise information about aircraft locations.
Additional transportation is not provided, and ground trains do not stop at Wembley, in addition there are no ground parking lots or "park and ride" facilities.
In fear of a lack of transportation, the possibility of playing the game behind closed doors without the team's supporters was raised.
The study published in the journal Science on Thursday announced the emergence of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands belonging to Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden announced that a new species developed in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer. The endemic medium ground finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant sharp-beaked ground finch, Geospiza conirostris, crossed.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It is possible to stretch it into a thin wire that can be twisted or braided. It can be hammered or rolled into thin sheets.
This can be made very thin and attached to other metals. This can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books, which were called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called chemical pH. You can make yourself an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the substance is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H represents hydrogen in pH) in the studied chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Stir together two dry powders and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
Your hands' moisture reacts with the external layers, creating a funny sensation and forming a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a water closet, which was connected to a complex sewage system.
Residues of sewage systems have been found in Crete, in the houses of the Minoan culture cities, and in Santorini, Greece.
Toilets existed in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women were mixed.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space picks up the call and reflects it almost instantly back.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts light and visibility slightly.
To send a satellite or telescope into space, a huge rocket over 100 feet high is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The most important change that the wheel has brought us is much easier and faster transportation.
Thanks to this, we have a train, car, and many other transportation devices.
On the lower level are medium-sized predators, who feed on medium-sized prey, starting from rabbits and ending with antelopes and goats.
The last ones are many small predators (including stray domestic cats) who eat significantly more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, specific work that each cat does, which keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all big cats, living in large groups called prides.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually very closely related to each other, forming a large family consisting of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave in many ways like wolf and dog packs - animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large predators) and are also very deadly to their prey.
Tiger, a versatile athlete, can climb (although not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four big cats can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but rather like a sentence growled with words.
Directlylots like to eat small animals. They try to catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds when possible. Almost all of the animals that the directlot hunts are significantly smaller than it.
According to scientists, direct otters hunt and find prey (victims) by scent, sniffing the places where they have been.
Their ability to see in the dark is excellent, and they also move very sneakily. The lynx blends into the surrounding environment to hunt prey and then pounces on it.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they originated from (for example, by crossing a mountain range or river, or by moving to a new island, and returning is not easy), they often end up in a different environment than before.
In a new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different traits from the previously necessary ones and must adapt to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
As time passes, as the new population adapts to their new environment, they increasingly look less like the other population.
As a result, after thousands or even millions of years, two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants produce food for themselves using photosynthesis from the sun. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is from plants. Without plants, animals wouldn't be able to survive.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time and therefore feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
In his long jaws, there were over 70 ultra-sharp teeth, in addition there were extra teeth in the palate, which means that nothing that crossed his path could escape.
It is not known for certain, but the mosasaur could have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
He also attacked everyone who went into the water, even a gigantic dinosaur like T-Rex was no match for him.
At the same time, while most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called a dormouse.
The second difference was that while poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, rich men enjoyed feasts where they ate reclining and resting.
Old Roman dishes could not contain ingredients that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and not a single Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People brought sacrificial offerings to the gods and priests took care of the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple has an open inner courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests may enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called tsikuraats were built as part of the temples.
The tower top was a special sanctuary for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not as important.
The Jewish family spent the majority of their life activities outdoors.
Women cooked outdoors; the shops were simply open counters facing the street. Houses were built from stone.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, which is why wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to the ancient Scandinavian sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it.
Despite his discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Although each country was Scandinavian-like, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the declaration of independence.
But that's not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence, date July 4, 1776." The text is located at the bottom of the document upside down."
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that in its early years it was rolled up to store a large parchment document (its dimensions are 29 ¾ by 24 ½ inches).
So it is likely that the label was simply added as a tag.
D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part was still not free.
There were Vichy French prevailing. These were the people of France who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
Allies invaded Southern France on August 15, 1940, and this operation became known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the liberated French forces had liberated the southern part of France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people living and working together, or society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means "of a citizen", related to the Latin words civis, "citizen", and civitas, which means "city or state", and also to some extent defines the size of a society.
City-states are the predecessors of countries. Civilizational culture means the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and sufficient cultural diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving appropriate historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, thirteen colonies formed a confederation based on the Articles of Confederation, which initially created a weak central government with Congress as its only component.
The congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the powers of the states to enact all legislation, often with little cooperation.
He also did not have the authority to cancel tax laws and inter-state tariffs.
The articles demanded unanimous consent from all states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives often did not attend.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world alongside the German national football team, and they won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions and Italians compete in this area at international and Olympic games.
Japan has nearly 7000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to as an archipelago in geographical terms due to the cluster/group of Japanese islands.
Taiwan was already mentioned in the 15th century, when European sailors sailing past wrote down the island's name as Ilha Formosa or "beautiful island" in Portuguese.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the traditional grain production practices of the indigenous people and hiring Chinese workers to work in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, transferring the right to govern Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings - namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common film format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
This is still being produced today, but even more important is that its proportions were inherited to the dimensions of digital camera image sensors.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusingly 36mm wide and 24mm long.
This aspect ratio (obtained by dividing by twelve to get the simplest ratio with whole numbers) is considered to be 3 : 2.
Many common formats (such as the group of APS formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The often misused and frequently ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics, maintaining a sense of regularity in the image.
According to this, the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines, dividing the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was carefully controlled.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had united European countries, despite the differences in their languages and customs.
This all-encompassing power affected everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the main beliefs of Christians is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's financial resources are meant for that purpose.
The center of church power had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money raised questions for many about whether this principle was being held to.
Soon after the start of the war, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective - it cut off vital supplies for the military and civilians, even though the blockade violated widely accepted international law, which has been established with several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Great Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering whole oceanic areas, even endangering neutral vessels.
Since this tactic did not elicit a special reaction, Germany awaited a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, a large portion of citizens and nations were pacifist and isolationist in their mindset.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, countries wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job in New York City at the Edison Company.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a farewell letter from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of describing different time periods; each period of Chinese history or each ruling family had a separate dynasty.
Each dynasty was also characterized by an unstable period of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the era of the three kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there was intense fighting between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The era of the three kingdoms was one of the bloodiest times in ancient Chinese history - thousands of people died in internal battles because they hoped to gain the highest position of power in the Xi'an Grand Palace.
There are many social and political impacts, such as the introduction of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just the ruler.
Even after the Revolution, the fields of activity were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same applies to the military, as instead of military ranks being based on class, they were now based on military merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many other countries' oppressed working class representatives to start their own revolution.
Muhammad had a great interest in deeper matters of life. He had a habit of often contemplating in the cave on Mount Noor ('light'), which became known as Hira.
The cave, which has survived through the ages, gives a vivid depiction of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is completely isolated from the outside world, located at the top of a mountain north of Mekas.
Actually, it's not easy at all to find if it were known to exist. Once in the cave, it is completely isolated.
There is nothing to see except for the clear beautiful sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be heard and seen from inside the cave.
The Pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has survived to this day.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of the many giant pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza plateau, also known as the "Giza necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, contains several pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "bow up" mark resembles the letter V and the "bow down" mark resembles a bracket or a square, with the bottom side missing.
""Üles"" means that you should start from the top and push the bow, and ""alla"" means that you should start from the root of the bow's frog (the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Upward stroke creates a softer sound, while the downward stroke is stronger and more powerful.
You are free to write down your notes, but remember that the printed barcodes are included for a musical reason and therefore should be taken into account.
Frightened Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to leave Versailles for Paris by a crowd of market women on October 6, 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed threats towards the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At one point, one of the members of the crowd waved the head of the royal guard who was killed in Versailles in front of the startled queen.
The war expenses for the conquest of the Philippines by USA imperialism were covered by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States of America to cover the expenses and bond interests that go through Wall Street banking institutions on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits earned from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the elementary profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Templar Knights, one must understand the context that motivated the order to be established.
The period in which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages, and it was a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The high middle ages was preceded by the early middle ages and followed by the late middle ages, which is conventionally considered to end around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses various ideas in practice, ranging from technological determinism or technological imperative to a firm belief that human destiny is guided by the logic associated with the laws of science and its manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely culturally or politically influenced, and that technology itself has an impact on society that is more internal than socially determined.
For example, it can be said that the presence of motor vehicles certainly necessitates the development of roads.
The domestic road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, which is why efforts are being made to develop new production methods to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher number of accidents on the road, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques for repairing injured bodies in healthcare.
The important part of Romanticism was cultural determinism, which relied on writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time, customs and culture related to geography emerged and those, being in harmony with the society's location, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
This fame as a place where all luxuries were concentrated began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
The status declined in the 12th century mainly because the crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices, which were more valuable than those offered in the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of the fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the dress was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture typical of the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West could lag behind by up to 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began developing its own style. One of the most significant developments during this time, caused by the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture in which food is produced in quantities sufficient to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Organic farming is a simple, often nature-friendly system, where to increase yields, seeds from this ecological region are used, crop rotation is practiced, or other relatively simple methods are used.
Historically, the majority of farmers earned their living through agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite individuals with similar ideas who feel that societal standards do not apply to them and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguishable based on members' age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
The characteristics that allow the subculture to be distinguished can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a certain subculture often indicate their membership through the use of special and symbolic style, including fashion, behavior manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw attention to those few unfortunate cases where adults neglected to socialize children during their upbringing due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional mistreatment.
Children like these are called feral or wild. People (often their parents) have held feral children captive; in some cases, parents abandoned the child due to severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children could experience severe mistreatment or trauma before abandonment or running away.
Others allegedly raised animals, and in some cases, it is said that they lived freely in the wild.
If a child is fully raised by an animal, the wild child (within physical limits) behaves almost entirely like the animal that raised him, for example, he may be afraid of people or indifferent towards them.
Although project-based learning is supposed to simplify acquisition and make it more interesting, the approach of educational orders is a step further.
The scaffolding method is not a teaching method, but rather a way to support people who are acquiring new learning experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, support can come from both a teacher and the little paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual steps are integrated into the software with the aim of questioning, referring to, and explaining procedures that may be too complex for the student to cope with alone.
Children are taken to the orphanage for various reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but unfortunately this happens.
We believe that the foster care system provides a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system aims to provide safe homes, caring guardians, stable education, and reliable medical care.
The foster family should provide all the needs that were lacking in the previous home from which they were removed.
The internet combines both mass communication and interpersonal communication elements.
The special characteristics of the internet bring additional dimensions in terms of usage and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are mentioned as important motivators for using the Internet (James et al, 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal involvement" and "continuing relationships" as new motivating aspects when they studied audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in interpreting micro expressions, which last only a few milliseconds.
The main claim is that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks highlighted in his article "The President's Speech" that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately perceive sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior exist in animals, for example, domesticated dogs.
Studies conducted in the 20th century have shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
In the case of segregation and recombination, diversity oscillates back and forth between two pools in each generation.
In the savanna, primates with a digestive system similar to humans have a hard time meeting their amino acid needs from available plants.
Even more, if this cannot be done, it has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant sources would have been the proteins in leafy and green vegetables, but for primates like us, they are easy to digest only when cooked.
On the other hand, animal food products (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large quantities of proteins, which contain all the necessary amino acids.
Taking all this into account, we should not be surprised that our own ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same way as chimpanzees do it today in the savannah.
Disturbance in sleep is the purposeful waking process during the usual sleep period and then falling back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This is easy, if you use a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness but doesn't fully wake you up.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm clock while sleeping, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to press it.
Other biorhythm-based choices include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or known diuretic teas) before bedtime to force yourself to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in the body and soul.
The less tension, the more positive the present vitality. Every person has the ability to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle in reaching this goal is tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded with the Mahayana path of love and several Indian yoga techniques.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It involves kundalini yoga, meditation, and the journey of all-encompassing love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened in Kundalini yoga.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and an illuminated consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the countries clashed due to differences in system, process, and culture.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies were already enemies and the Cold War began.
This was supposed to last for the next 40 years, and authorized armies were supposed to actually fight on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken and the only hope was to retreat and regroup around the Romanian bridgehead.
Those plans, however, were almost immediately thwarted when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the occupation of the eastern territories of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other both bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
Using ships for transporting goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the task of the navies has been to ensure that the state is able to move people and goods, while at the same time preventing the enemy's ability to move those people and goods.
One of the most recent notable examples of this was the North Atlantic Campaign during the Second World War. The Americans tried to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the mainly submarine-using German navy attempted to halt this traffic.
If the allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Great Britain like the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were originally domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them to gain easy access to milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds, who grazed on hillsides or other pastures, and were often herded by children or teenage goat herders, similar to more well-known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
The railway track was already built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon roads consisted of nothing but parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and pull larger quantities than on the slightly rougher roads of that time.
Rails were put into use quite early to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was understood that tracks are more effective when they have iron bars on them.
This became the usual method, but the iron wore out the wooden wheels of the carriage more.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron-made tracks were put into use.
The first known form of transportation was walking - Homo erectus (or upright human) began walking two million years ago.
Their predecessor, the australopithecus, was not accustomed to walking upright.
Examples of specialization in walking on two legs can be found in the fossils of Australopithecus, which date back to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
In order to reduce future suffering to some extent, we can start living more environmentally friendly, join the environmental movement, and even become activists.
Often this is exactly like treating the symptoms. But if we do not want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root cause of the problem and eliminate it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and problems have grown larger due to overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle of humanity.
After the Congress had adopted it on July 4th, the draft manuscript signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house located a few quarters away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, which are now known as Dunlap copies.
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon on July 8th in the Independence Hall.
One was sent on July 6th to George Washington, who had it read to his soldiers on July 9th in New York. A copy of it reached London on August 10th.
25 copies made by Dunlap are the oldest surviving specimens of the declaration. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds also have several characteristics that look like a dinosaur.
They have scaly and clawed feet, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on information manipulation encoded in binary format.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers or, if using computer slang, bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms such as vomiting are quite generic and do not allow for an immediate diagnosis.
The clear sign of ingested or -drunk poison may be an open medicine package or toxic household chemicals nearby.
Look at the label for specific instructions for administering first aid for the poison.
Entomologists use the term "True bugs" officially for this group of insects.
This term comes from a long history of acquaintance with bedbugs, which have adapted extremely well to living as a parasite on humans.
Both bed bugs and fleas are nest parasites, adapted to living in a nest or the host's living quarters.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which comprises the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research found that the occurrence of MS is twice as likely in women as in men.
A couple can decide that raising a child is not in their or the child's best interests.
These couples may choose to give their child up for adoption.
During adoption, biological parents waive their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to figure out how the world works. In fact, this method is the basis for most scientific research.
Research is not only based on experimentation - an experiment is a test used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses - but also on asking questions and observing.
Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's scientific views, including those related to psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of Greek language decreased, the Western world found itself cut off from the philosophical and scientific roots of Greece.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on endogenous cycles and their generation through biological clocks.
The occurrence of periodic rhythms, which are not simply a reaction to external periodic factors, has been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillation system that continues its cyclic nature even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that indicated that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They made two attempts, marking the DNA phage with either radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ line cells.
Only mutations in the germ line cells can be inherited by children, mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural places to enjoy views and also wild plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about Borneo orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work, and in turn, others pass by whose workplace is in the town they just left.
In this dynamic minibus, everything is in some way connected to and supporting the private vehicle-based transportation system.
Science has now shown that this huge carbon dioxide-producing economy has disrupted one of the biosphere's stable states that has been favorable for human evolution over the past 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges at similar levels.
Why do transportation systems cause complaints about daily failures? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is a study that examines the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Studying traffic flow is unfortunately difficult because it is not possible to predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently, so traffic flows tend to be somewhat reasonably consistent and can be mathematically represented in a broad sense.
In order to better describe traffic flow, relationships between three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections contribute to the planning, designing, and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to start moving through the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies much more easily and find food and mates much more effectively.
Most insects are capable of folding their wings against their body.
This gives them more opportunities to find small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that are unable to turn their wings backwards are beetles and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought the opposite - the solar system with the Sun (and even other stars) revolved around the Earth.
This seems reasonable, because there is no feeling that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the world's second longest and largest river. It carries eight times as much water as the world's second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, which is sometimes six miles wide.
20% of the water flowing from the world's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. Water from thousands of smaller rivers flows into it.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the old kingdom, nothing surpassed the size of the Giza pyramids or their technical knowledge of construction.
The old Egyptians of the new state admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses the Italian language in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also an everyday language used by the majority of people working in the country, while Latin is used in religious services.
All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholics.
People have known chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as they can be found in their natural form in nature and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Philosopher Aristotle assumed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like four aggregate states (in the same order) - solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma states - although he also speculated that they form new substances that we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Such elements as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You may also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe consists of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so unbelievably small that there could fit trillions of them at the end of this sentence.
So when it was first introduced, the pencil was a good friend for many.
The importance and usage of the pencil has decreased, as unfortunately newer writing methods have emerged.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever needing to use a sharpener.
One can only speculate what will happen to the keyboard when something new arises.
The nuclear bomb operates on the principle that it requires energy to force the atomic nucleus together with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they tend to decay with a little push or spontaneously.
The moon's surface is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The ice sheet is about 70 km thick on the front side and 100 km thick on the back side.
This is thinner under the sea and thicker under the highland.
On the closer side, there may be more seas because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
The achievement motivation theories seek to understand what drives people to act and what they enjoy.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that are adopted during the maturation process into adulthood.
These theories deal with what makes certain people want to do the things they do, and what environmental factors cause these people to do certain things or not.
Two of the most popular need-based theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
When managers start leading their former peers, it can generally evoke dual behavior. One extreme of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the boys (or girls)".
: This type of leader finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, discipline, conduct evaluations, assign responsibilities, and hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum is a person who becomes unrecognizable, feeling that he needs to change everything that the team has done so far and make it his own.
Finally, ultimately the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Such behavior often causes conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same high standards as regular teams, but there are still small differences.
Virtual team members are often the direct contact point for their real group.
They typically have more autonomy than regular team members as their teams may have to meet across different time zones that their local management may not understand.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is an administrative team to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
What reason would a company have for undertaking the time-consuming task of creating an educational organization? One of the goals of integrating entrepreneurship education concepts is innovation.
When all the available resources of functional departments throughout the organization are effectively utilized, creativity and resourcefulness will start to emerge.
As a result, the company's efforts to overcome obstacles in cooperation can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, the management must create a culture of innovation and also shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help companies reach higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Thus, it defines the research field and makes it more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports researchers' studies.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, injuries and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gave us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us better understand the processes taking place in our brains.
Although AI is strongly associated with the realm of science, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
AI research involves automating machines in such a way that they can solve tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include checking, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on finding solutions for real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in the fields of economy, medicine, engineering, and military, and they are also built into various home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of every class. Teachers often like to take students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual outings. Students can sit in class and view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful arts.
Sharing the tour virtually is also a great way to document a trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a webpage every year about their trip to the state capital. The webpage is redesigned every year, but old versions are kept for remembrance.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. However, if students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger tries to improve their writing skills to avoid criticism.
"Likewise, "blogging compels students to better understand the world around them". Capturing the attention of readers encourages students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004)."
Blogging is a tool that provides inspiration for collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
Relevant use of blogs can help students become more analytical and critical; actively responding to internet materials allows students to determine their position in relation to other people's writings and provide an overview of their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the fascinating bilingual capital of Canada and offers a wide variety of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lies the Niagara Falls and to the north stretches Muskoka and the untouched natural beauty of the areas beyond.
All of the above mentioned and more highlights Ontario as characteristic of Canada for foreigners.
The vast areas further north are quite sparsely populated and at times almost uninhabited wild nature.
It may come as a surprise to many, but there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is overwhelmingly the largest and practically its own continent in terms of fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or in connection with France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought the Islamic religion to these lands and it became very popular in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is advisable for female passengers, regardless of their marital status, to say that they are married.
Wearing a ring also comes in handy (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that due to cultural differences, something may be done that they perceive as harassment, and it is not unusual for this to include stalking, grabbing, and so on.
Tell the men firmly no and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean it's ok!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids used it as a strategic port known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it from scratch under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city of Daru I-Badyana, and Spanish merchants, who established trading centers there, gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
In the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather products, water pipes, and a whole range of different trinkets, but it is all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Goma Nyiragongo volcano destroyed most of the city streets, especially downtown.
If Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma should be researched and understood in advance to know the current status of the conflict in North Kivu province.
The city also serves as a base for ascending the Nyiragongo volcano, and it offers the most affordable options for tracking African mountain gorillas.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) for getting around Goma. The regular (local) price for a short ride is ~500 Congolese francs.
Timbuktu has started to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant places due to its relatively difficult accessibility.
Timbuktu is a impoverished city, even though its fame makes it a tourist attraction and there is an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sands.
This was one of the most important stops in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World."
Compared to other cities in the country, this is completely different, as it has more of an Arabic than African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The area of the park is 19,500 km² and it is divided into 14 different ecological regions, each supporting different types of wildlife.
This is one of the main attractions in South Africa, considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African nature reserves, daily conservation and entrance fees apply in this park as well.
It can also be useful to buy a Wild Card visitor's card, which allows entry to certain South African parks or all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is a place that many tourists consider a primary attraction.
The row of buildings shaping the silhouette of Hong Kong has been compared to glittering bar charts that come to life in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
"In order to see Hong Kong at its best, leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon coast."
Many of the city development projects on Hong Kong Island are located densely in the area along the northern coast.
This is the place that British colonizers took for themselves. So, it's a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the colonial period of the territory.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast to Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest that falls within the territory of India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not only mangrove swamps - they include some last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the plains of the Ganges.
The area of Sundarbans is 3850 km², of which approximately one third is covered by water or wetland areas.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has also been a nature reserve and currently an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer live in the area.
Buses depart from the inner city bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
It is advisable to buy the ticket a couple of days in advance as the buses between districts are often full.
Most areas are serviced by small Japanese beach shuttle buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a footbridge. It extends over the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with the city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Two towers reach a height of 83 meters, the bridge is 378 meters long and it has two 3.5-meter wide lanes.
The bridge clearance is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the plans, the bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs points are expected to be completed.
The Guarani indigenous people were the most remarkable group of natives who inhabited the eastern regions of present-day Paraguay and lived a semi-nomadic lifestyle as hunter-gatherers, also practicing agriculture for sustenance.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived thanks to hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was born as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquerors and indigenous peoples, which was previously called the giant province of the Indies.
The Spaniards started a colonization period that lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous essence.
It is known that the water polo teams and players of Argentina are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is taking place in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here at other times of the year.
Check tournament news and polo match ticket information on the Asociacion Argentina de Polo website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is pegged at par with the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located opposite FIC West store in Stanley.
Overall, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
In the peripheral areas of the islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; consult with the owners beforehand to determine the appropriate method of payment.
Exchanging Falkland currency outside of the islands is nearly impossible, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, they have summer when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures above +30 °C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity together create a colder feeling than what is shown on the thermometer.
There are no specific rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rain remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park animals are used to seeing people, it is still wild nature and should not be disturbed.
According to park authorities, it is necessary to keep a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how calm they may appear, bison, wolves, deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they did not keep the right distance. These are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals, so leave them the necessary space.
You should also know that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so do not carry or cook strong-smelling foods, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
The official translation of the sentence would be: "Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959."
The infamous 1889 maritime blockade took place in the port, where seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships except for one British cruiser sank. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans perished.
During the freedom struggle led by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the assassination of chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland is surrounded by two harbours, there are many beaches there. The most popular of them are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay (in the north) to Devonport (in the south).
These are almost all sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most of them offer shade from tall pine trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in Waitemata Harbor, in the elite suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in the central part of Auckland.
These are sometimes overcrowded beaches intended for family vacations, which are lined with a good selection of stores. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is Number One, which has a taste that is not complex, but pleasant and refreshing. The name of the other local beer is Manta.
French wines may be plentiful, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more suitable for traveling.
The local tap water is perfectly suitable for drinking, but if you are worried, it is easy to find bottled water as well.
For Australians, "flat white" is a foreign concept. "Short black" is espresso, cappuccino is served with a pile of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Trips to the coral reef are made throughout the year, and it is rare for any of them to cause injuries to the coral reef.
Still, take heed of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
The harbor seal is found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the town called 1770. Occasionally, they can also be found outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are scared of people and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live entirely in the ocean; their main habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Pre-booking gives the traveler peace of mind that they have a place to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agencies often have contracts with specific hotels, but you can find other accommodation options through the travel agency, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even combined packages with flights and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation if you want to reconsider the offer or obtain other documents for the destination (such as a visa).
Any changes and requests should be discussed with the tour operator first, not directly with the hotel.
For some music festivals, the majority of participants decide to camp on-site and consider it a very important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to go early to get a camping spot near the music.
Keep in mind that even though music may not be played on the main stages anymore, there may be other stages at the festival where music is played until late in the evening.
Some festivals have special camping areas designed for families with small children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, check where your cabin is located, because driving through ice creates quite a loud noise for nearby cabins.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually make an effort to keep guests there as long as possible and spend as much money as possible. Typically, there are no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
Usually they have special food, drinks, and entertainment offerings to keep guests in good spirits and not leave.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks on the house. However, being drunk weakens decision-making and all good gamblers know that it's important to stay sober.
All who travel at high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction force is small and you cannot drive the same way as when you are on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a short period of time to become stuck.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or drifting snow, as well as condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries and traffic continues mostly constantly throughout the year.
Africa's biggest tourism attraction is probably safaris, which are the highlight of the trip for many guests.
The popularly used term "safari" refers to land trips with the aim of exploring African wildlife, especially savannas.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, come close to cars and can be observed with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes timid and it is easier to see them with binoculars.
A safari walk (referred to in English as ""bush walk,"" ""hiking safari"" or ""footing"") consists of a hike that can last for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some of the events will take place in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo, where the games took place in 1964, is the only Asian city where the Olympic Games have been held twice.
If you booked flights and accommodation for the year 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation rules are different, but as of the end of March, most of the cancellation rules based on the coronavirus will no longer apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were supposed to take place.
Most ticket prices are expected to range from 2500 ¥ to 13 0000 ¥, with regular tickets costing around 7000 ¥.
Ironing damp clothes helps them to dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, even if it is not in your room.
If an iron is not at hand or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric become too hot (which can cause shrinkage or in extreme cases, scorching).
There are different ways to purify water, some are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, while elsewhere it may need to be done for several minutes.
The efficiency of filters varies and if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reliable manufacturer in a closed bottle.
Passengers may encounter wildlife pests that are not known in their home area.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in worst case scenarios, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force are not usually classified as pests.
Buying duty-free is an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont introduces the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated forested landscapes.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, then drive carefully: steep slopes, narrow roads, and sudden turns are common.
Speed limits are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections – usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Strangely enough, the mobile service here is much stronger than in many other parts of the route, such as in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good and in Bavaria quite rich and diverse, similar to those of their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are a regular occurrence, with apples being baked into pastries year-round and cherries and plums making their appearance in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some rich and indulgent pastry, try the baked good that is called berliner, pfannkuchen or krapfen depending on the region.

Indonesian cuisine is a general term that includes a wide range of regional cuisines found throughout the country, allowing for choices from among 17,000 islands.
But when used without additional modifiers, this term tends to refer to food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, widely available throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simply flavored dishes, with peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices being the favorite seasonings of the Javanese people.
On either side of the saddle, there are stirrups for supporting the rider's feet.
These help the rider maintain better balance, but can be dangerous as the rider's legs may get stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown off the horse's back, but their foot gets stuck in the stirrup, it may happen that the horse can drag them along while running away. To reduce this risk, precautions should be followed.
First, most riders wear smooth, fairly narrow riding boots with a heel.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety releases that allow the stirrup leather to come away from the saddle if the falling rider pulls it backwards.
In the Cochamo Valley, Chile's primary climbing destination, known as the South American Yosemite, there are various large granite rock walls and cliffs.
Breathtaking views open up from the peaks of the mountain ridges. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes on these endless potential rocky walls.
Mountain snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity among many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski-bums," who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a specific location.
Skiing is very old - skiers have been depicted in cave drawings for as long as 5000 years BC!
Skiing as a sport was already practiced in the 17th century and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Cross-country skiing: this activity is also called wilderness skiing, ski touring or ski trekking.
This is related to alpine skiing or mountain climbing, but does not usually include them. Alpine skiing or mountain climbing is typically done in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, it is possible for you to cover somewhat greater distances than by walking, but even on well-maintained tracks, you rarely achieve the speed of cross-country skiing that is similar to riding without a backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Usually, traveling through multiple countries means having to apply for a visa multiple times and go through passport control.
But in this matter, the Schengen zone functions somewhat like one country.
As long as you stay within this zone, it is essentially possible for you to cross borders without going through passport control points again.
If you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each Schengen member state separately, thereby saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that determines which manufactured goods are antiquities. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies in different geographical regions, for example in places like North America, the age limit may be shorter than in Europe.
Handmade products can be called antiques, though they are not as old as similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for many Sami people, and trading culture is important for many other professions as well.
But even traditionally not all Saami people were involved in extensive reindeer husbandry, rather they lived from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Many Sami people are currently working in modern commerce. In the Sami region of Lapland, tourism is an important source of income.
Although the word "gypsy" is widely used, especially by those who are not Roma, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and an inaccurate portrayal of the Roma nation.
If travel recommendations apply to the country you are visiting, it may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
Perhaps you would prefer to consult with a different government instead of your own, but their advice is intended for the citizens there.
One example is that American citizens may face different situations in the Middle East compared to Europeans or Arabs.
The state travel advice is just a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
The presented views are often superficial, generalized and overly simplified, compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Harsh weather conditions are a general term for any dangerous weather phenomena that have the potential to cause damage, serious societal disruptions, or take lives.
Difficult weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation and forest fires are extreme weather events, as are also thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and whirlwinds.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Passengers are strongly advised to be aware of all the hazards of severe weather conditions affecting the area, as it may impact travel plans.
All those planning a trip to a country that can be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An internet search for the hostile environment course will likely result in the address of a local company.
The course usually delves much more into the problems discussed here, often accompanied by practical experience.
The course usually lasts 3-5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapon training.
Books and magazines addressing the sustainability of wild nature are common, but there are few publications addressing war zones.
Passengers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.
The desire of governments to issue passports without gender (X) or documents that have been renewed to match the desired name or gender varies.
The readiness of foreign authorities to respect these documents also varies greatly.
Security checks have become much more thorough in security checkpoints since September 11, 2001.
Preoperative transgender individuals should not assume that they will undergo security checks without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
With backflow currents, the water flow bounces back from the shore, often hitting a reef or something similar.
Due to underwater landforms, the returning water flow moves to a deeper location and there may form a strong current heading towards the deep waters.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion from swimming against the current, as it can be an impossible task.
As soon as you are out of the current, swimming back is no harder than normal.
Try to move somewhere where it won't pull you back in, or if you don't have enough skills and you have been noticed, you can expect a rescue team.
The shock associated with returning comes earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who find it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes have a very hard time adapting back to their local culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of your home culture habits.
In the beginning, people were likely patient and understanding with the arrivals from abroad, knowing that travelers need time to adjust to a new country.
People may not anticipate that returning passengers may need patience and understanding at home.
Children find the pyramid sound and light show in this area to be one of the most interesting things.
Before the start of the performance, you will see pyramids in the dark and can view them in silence.
Usually you can always hear the voices of tourists and traders. Sound and light tell a story just like a storybook.
The sphinx has been made the backdrop of the show and the narrator of a long tale.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated with lights.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have been claimed by several countries, and have the most bases - 16 active bases as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island, with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, where a flooded crater from a previously active volcano forms a prominent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region in the southern part of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsular mountains merge with the plain here, then rise again to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountain Range, which is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The highest mountains in Antarctica - the Vinson Massif - are located in the northern part of the Sentinel Range, with the highest peak being the 4892 m high Vinson Mountain.
In remote locations where there is no mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
The satellite phone does not usually replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors and have an unobstructed view of the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is often used by shipping, including pleasure boats, but also by expeditions that require remote data and voice.
You should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service with your local telephone service provider.
An increasingly popular option for gap year planners is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before going to university without negatively affecting their educational path.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during a gap year can improve your chances of continuing your higher education in your home country.
Generally, a fee is charged for registering for these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. This so-called land of a thousand lakes also has a thousand islands located in both lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht to sail between the archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks allow for a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven to eight people.
The indicators are equivalent in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is a unique phenomenon (e.g. in the Netherlands, this number is one in forty).
Most of the various Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stop in Russia's St. Petersburg.

If you go ashore only with ship excursions, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009 onwards).
Some leisure travel brochures highlight the German city of Berlin. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea and visiting this city is not included in the price of the leisure trip.
Traveling by plane can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if it's their first flight or if they have had traumatic experiences in the past.
You don't have to be ashamed of it, it is not different from many people's personal fears and aversions towards other things.
Understanding the principles of aircraft operation and what happens during flight can help some people overcome fear based on ignorance or lack of control.
Courier companies are paid well for fast delivery of packages. Often, time is very important for business documents, goods or urgently needed spare parts for repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own airplanes, but on other routes and for smaller companies, there were problems.
When the items were sent by air transport, it could take days to unload and pass through customs on some routes.
The only way to expedite this was to send it as registered luggage. The airline's rules do not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The easiest way to fly first class is to shell out a big pile of money for this luxury (or even better, have your company do it for you).
But it's not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay four times as much for business class and 11 times as much for first class as for regular economy class!
Generally, it's not worth even looking for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines know very well that there is a group of flyers who are willing to pay a large amount of money to fly somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge a corresponding price for it.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in East Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but which has not been recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been re-established between the two parts of Moldova despite failures in political negotiations.
Moldova's main religion is Orthodox Christianity.

Visit the shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, which is world-famous as a place of apparitions of the Virgin Mary, in the northern part.
Remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave and that this place has almost immeasurable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
Even today, there are still men and women alive who have survived the time spent here, and even more of those whose loved ones were either killed or forced to work to death here, whether they were Jews or not.
Treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the topic of Nazis.
Do not deface the area by vandalizing its buildings with a marker or by scratching them.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and practically everyone speaks Spanish.
But most of the signs are only in Catalan because, by law, it is the first official language.
But Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
In the metro, announcements are made regularly only in Catalan, but the automated system informs about unplanned disruptions in several different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The common belief is that Parisians are self-centered, arrogant, and full of themselves.
Although often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to cope in Paris is to behave as politely as possible, maintaining oneself as a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) person. This makes getting around much easier.
The clumsy attitude of Parisians disappears quickly when you show basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered with dense forests, mainly beech, fir, and spruce trees, and there grows a mixture of mountain and Mediterranean plant species.
There is a significantly wide diversity of plant species due to its different microclimates, soils, and altitudes.
The area is also home to an extremely diverse collection of animal and bird species.
Here you can find not only many common species but also rare animals, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and grouse.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries do offer coverings for women who are unprepared, but if you have something of your own, especially if it's brightly colored, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Men must also wear pants that cover the knees.
This can also be rented at the entrance, but the garment is not washed after every use, so wearing these skirts may not be pleasant. One size fits all for men!
Mallorcan dishes, like similar Mediterranean dishes, are based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and use a lot of olive oil.

All nouns, including the word "Sie" ("you"), always start with a capital letter, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between a verb and an object.
Allegedly, this makes reading easier, although writing is again more difficult, as it is necessary to figure out whether a verb or an adjective is used as a noun.
In Italian, pronunciation is quite easy because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.

Observatories predating the modern era are typically outdated today and remain in use as museums or educational sites.
During their heyday, light pollution was not such a problem as it is now, they are usually located in cities or university campuses and are easier to access than modern ones.
Most modern scientific telescopes are large facilities in remote areas with favorable weather conditions.
Observing cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea originates from China, where the chosen flowers were plum blossoms.
The first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor in Japan and were intended only for him and other aristocrats from the imperial court.

The more traditional churches often hold Easter memorial services on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, with congregations often gathering to celebrate at midnight to mark the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that arrived on the island originally got here by swimming, flying, or drifting.
Since the mainland is a long way, mammals could not undertake this journey, which is why giant tortoises are the primary herbivores on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs, have been brought there.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar nights, meaning that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This gives a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is dark almost all day.
Since these areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is a rare problem for them, it is possible to enjoy the stars there.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
