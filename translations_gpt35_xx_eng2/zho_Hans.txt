This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers - a theory that has already been widely circulated - but also provides details that fossils typically cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the top of this animal's feathers are chestnut brown, while the bottom is light or carrot-colored.
This discovery also helps to deepen understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Dinosaur feathers did not develop a well-defined central shaft - known as a "rachis," but still had other feather features, such as barbs and barbules, researchers inferred that the evolution of the rachis may have come later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they are not used for flying, but for regulating temperature or display. Researchers believe that, despite being a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows mature feathers, not those of a juvenile.
Researchers believe that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the samples show adult feathers rather than the fluff of a chick.

The completed work is mostly theoretical, but the purpose of writing the program is to simulate the observation of the Andromeda galaxy.
The effect the team is looking for may be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of galaxies and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just like the moon exerts gravitational force on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Andromeda galaxy.
Scientists can conclude that the way dark matter affects other dark matter is the same as regular matter.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in some kind of halo around the galaxy, composed of many small particles.

The sentence translated to English: What I said to people is: how we treat you, you treat us the same way.
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill banning the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The bill stipulates that violent video games sold in California must be labeled with "18," and retailers will be fined $1000 for each illegal sale to minors.
Director of Public Prosecutions and Royal legal adviser Kier Starmer made a statement this morning, announcing the prosecution of Huna and Praise.
Huw Naa has already resigned, and his position in the cabinet will be replaced by the Member of Parliament, Ed Davey. It is expected that the Member of Parliament, Norman Lamb, will take over the vacant position of the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy left by Davey.
Huna and Price will appear in Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16th.
The victims were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback. Cuddeback was driving at the time.
Edgar Veguilla's arm and chin were injured, while Kristoffer Schneider needs facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon malfunctioned when it was aimed at the fifth person. Schneider was in constant pain, one eye blind, part of the skull missing, only to have his face reshaped with titanium plates.
Schneider testified via video link at the US Air Force (USAF) base in its homeland.
Apart from the match on Wednesday, Carpanedo also participated in two individual competitions of the championship.
Her first project was obstacle skiing, and she finished the first round of the competition with an "unfinished" result. 36 out of 116 participants achieved the same result.
Her other event was the 500m, where she ranked tenth in the women's standing category with a total time of 4:41.30 minutes, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-ranked Austrian athlete Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-ranked Hungarian athlete Gongqi Dani.
Four female skiers in the sitting group did not finish, and 45 out of 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom event did not make it to the rankings.
The central state police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Commissioner of Police D K Arya said, "We have arrested 5 people for raping the Swiss woman and found her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants' names are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The defendant appeared in court with their faces covered, said Police Chief Qandra Shukar Solanki.
Although the car hit the house with three people inside, no one was injured in the end.
However, the driver's head was seriously injured.
The road where the accident occurred is temporarily closed, and emergency rescue personnel rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
At first, he was taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth for treatment.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Afterwards, Adekya was charged with the murder of her son and stood trial at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She has been detained, awaiting prosecution and trial; but any evidence from witnesses may be compromised, as her image has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish judicial system is different, and the courts believe that publishing photos could cause potential harm.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee pointed out, "It seems potentially harmful for journalists to publish photos and other information about suspects."
The main department responsible for prosecution, the Royal Prosecution Service, told reporters that they will not make any further comments at least before filing charges.
According to reports, the document will mention the border dispute, and Palestine hopes to base it on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to reports, other topics under discussion include the future status of the holy Jerusalem for both countries and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands to deploy military forces in the central valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian National Authority only agrees to retain for five years.
The forest rangers will closely monitor the shooters who participate in the insect pest control supplementary experiments, as the experiments will be monitored and evaluated for their effectiveness.
The Shooter Athlete Association has recruited qualified volunteers for the hunting program in cooperation with the National Park Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the New South Wales Shooter Athlete Association (NSW).
NPWS Acting Director Mick O'flynn said the four shooters selected to participate in the first shooting operation have undergone comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in as a member of the new interim electoral council (CEP) consisting of 9 members.
This is Martelly's fifth time being selected by the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in Haiti in the past four years.
Last month, the Presidential Committee suggested the former CEP to resign, as part of the push for the country to move towards new election measures.
The committee is Martelly's response to the large-scale anti-government protests that began in October.
Since 2011, these protest activities have been sparked by some elections not being held as scheduled, and sometimes the protests escalate into violent incidents.
According to reports, there have been about 60 cases of iPod malfunction and overheating, resulting in a total of 6 fires and 4 minor burn injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that they have already noticed 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple reported an additional 34 cases of overheating incidents to the department, although the company stated that these incidents were "not serious."
The Economic Industry Province responded, saying that the delay in the release of the report by Apple is "very regrettable."
The Mariana Islands experienced an earthquake at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands stated that there have been no reports of disaster losses in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that no signs of a tsunami were detected.
A former police officer in the Philippines hijacked a tourist bus in the capital Manila and held Hong Kong tourists on board as hostages.
Rolando Mendoza aimed his M16 rifle at the tourists and opened fire.
Multiple hostages have been rescued, and at least six hostages have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages (including children and the elderly) as well as those Filipino photographers were released early.
Two photographers then replaced an old woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendosa was then shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career as a doctor.
He undertook obstetrician training and started working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Liggins began researching premature birth in his spare time while working at the hospital.
His research indicates that applying hormones can accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs.
The government investigation team discovered two "black box" flight data recorders on Wednesday, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
Other wrestlers also mourned Luna one after another.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first lady of extreme, my first manager. Luna passed away on a double moon night. Nights like that were as special as she was, she was a tough woman."
Dustin Runnels (nickname "Goldust") commented, "Luna is as elusive as I am... she may be even more elusive... I love her, and I will miss her... I hope she has gone to a better place."
A survey was conducted on 1,400 respondents before the 2010 federal election, and the number of respondents opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, caretaker prime minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic after the retirement of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of the respondents consistently expressed their hope that Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom would become the last monarch of Australia.
There is a polarized situation in the vote, with 29% of respondents believing that Australia should establish a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never establish a republic.
This Olympic gold medalist was supposed to participate in the 100m and 200m freestyle events and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his health has been constantly questioned due to his complaints.
He has been unable to use medication to alleviate the pain, as the competition prohibits participants from taking these drugs.
Mathematician and computer science professor Curtis Cooper of the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
In early February, a few people verified this discovery using different hardware and software and announced it on Tuesday.
The comet may be the source of water and organic matter on Earth, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed since the collision of comets with Earth a long time ago, especially the formation of Earth.
At the age of 53, Cuomo has been serving as governor since the beginning of this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chattering and foolish behavior".
It is speculated that he will participate in the presidential election in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States claims that the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) can shorten flight routes for aircraft, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of old ground radar technology, allowing air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
Without additional modes of transport, the overground train does not stop at Wembley, and there are no parking lots or intermodal facilities.
The competition might have to be held behind closed doors due to concerns about lack of transportation, which would mean no team supporters.
On Thursday, a study published in the journal "Science" reported that a new species of bird has formed in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species evolved in just two generations due to the breeding between the native ground finch and the introduced cactus finch, despite the belief that this process would take much longer.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can be curled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into fine threads for wrapping and knotting, or pounded and rolled into flakes.
It can be made very thin, stick on other metals, and because it is so thin, it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "colorful manuscript".
This is called the pH value of the chemical substance. You can use red cabbage juice to make an indicator.
The color of cabbage juice will change depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemicals.
The pH value is a measure of the hydrogen ions in the chemical being tested.
The hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost an electron (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Stir two types of dry powder to mix them, then use clean wet hands to knead them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, forming a shell-like substance, which feels very interesting.
Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, both cities, had flush toilets in almost every home, connected to intricate sewage systems.
The remains of a sewage system were found in the houses of the cities of Knossos in Crete and Santorini.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, the toilet was part of a mixed-gender public bathhouse.
When you make a phone call to someone far away, you will use a satellite.
The satellite in space almost immediately reflected the phone call back.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere causes certain light and visibility to become distorted.
To send a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket over 100 feet high is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. Its biggest contribution to us is making our transportation more convenient.
With it, we have trains, cars, and many other transportation vehicles.
Below them are more medium-sized felines, which eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits, gazelles to deer.
In the end, many small felids (including free-ranging pet cats) prey on much larger numbers of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the niche concept, with each cat responsible for a specific task, preventing them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most sociable of all cat species, living in large groups called prides.
The lion pride is made up of one to three adult males with a close kinship, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
As sisters and daughters within a large family, females usually have close relationships with each other.
The behavior of a pack of lions is very similar to that of a wolf pack or a pack of dogs. These animals behave remarkably similar to lions (but unlike other large feline species), and these behaviors are also very deadly for their prey.
The tiger is an all-around athlete, it can climb (although climbing ability is not very strong), swim, jump far, and its pulling force can reach five times that of a human strongman.
Tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars belong to the same genus (Panthera). These four big cats are the only ones that can roar among all the feline species.
The roar of a tiger is not as deep as a lion's roar, but more like an angry hiss.
Leopards love to eat small animals. If conditions allow, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. The prey of leopards is almost always much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that the American leopard cat tracks and hunts for prey on the ground through scent and smell.
Their night vision is very strong, they can see very clearly in the darkness, and their movement is also very stealthy. The hunting method of the leopard cat is to blend into the surrounding environment first, and then pounce on the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from their original main population (such as by crossing mountains and rivers, or by reaching a new island where it is not easy to return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptability to become a strong competitor, rather than what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, and they still need to adapt to the environment as before.
With the passage of time, new populations begin to adapt to new environments, and they start to become increasingly dissimilar to other populations.
After thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will eventually appear to be completely different, to the point where they cannot be considered the same species.
We call this process "speciation", which is the formation of new species. Speciation is a necessary result of evolution and is also a very important part of evolution.
Plants can produce the oxygen that humans inhale and absorb the carbon dioxide exhaled by humans.
Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis. They can also provide shade.
We use plants to make houses and clothes. Most of the food we eat is from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The Canglong is the top predator of that era, and it fears nothing except its own kind.
Its long lower jaw is filled with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, with a row of them on the upper jaw. This means that anything that encounters it has no escape.
Its tongue may be split, and we are not yet sure about this. Its food includes sea turtles, large fish, other sea serpents, and it may even eat people.
It will attack anything entering the water; not even giant dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex are its match.
Although most of the food consumed by the Romans was familiar to us, they did indeed have some strange or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called dormouse.
Another difference is that the poor and women sit on chairs to eat, while the rich prefer to gather together for banquets and eat while reclining.
The food from the Americas or Asia that entered Europe centuries later could not have appeared in the diet of the ancient Romans.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their deities, considering it as the residence of the god.
People will offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests will satisfy the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Every temple has a courtyard open to the public and an inner sanctum accessible only to priests.
Some special pagodas are in the shape of a pyramid and are called pyramid-shaped pagodas, built as part of a temple.
The top of the tower is a special holy place for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses are not really that important.
Hebrew families mostly spend their lives outdoors.
The women cook in the courtyard; the store is actually just an open counter facing the street. They use stone to build houses.
Canaan does not have large forests, so wood is very expensive.
Greenland has few inhabitants. According to the Nordic Saga of the Saga, the red-bearded Eric was exiled from Iceland for murder and sailed westward, discovering land, which he named Greenland.
But regardless of whether he found it or not, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although all belonging to "Scandinavia", there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think that there is a treasure map on the back of the "Declaration of Independence".
However, this is not the case. Although there is something written on the back of this document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the "Declaration of Independence" is written "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" at the bottom of the document, and it is written upside down.
Although no one can determine who the author is, it is said that this large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was originally stored rolled up when it was first written.
Therefore, it is very likely that this symbol was just added as a label.
The Normandy landing and the subsequent battles liberated the northern part of France, but the south was still not liberated.
It was ruled by the Vichy French. These French people reached a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940, not resisting the invaders but cooperating with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces entered the south of France in an operation known as the "Operation Dragoon".
Only two weeks, the armies of the United States and Free France liberated the southern part of France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a population (society) living together and working together.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis" (meaning "civil"), and is related to the Latin words "civis" (meaning "citizen") and "civitas" (meaning "city" or "state"), which in some way also defines the scale of society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. A civilizational culture means the passing down of knowledge from generation to generation, the lingering presence of cultural footprints, and the fair transmission of culture.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving behind any relevant historical evidence, and are not considered as decent civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation (with Congress as its only component).
The Congress does not have the power to impose taxes, and because there is no national executive or judicial department, the Congress can only rely on state governments to implement all laws, and state governments often do not cooperate.
It also does not have the power to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
These provisions must be approved unanimously by all states before they can be modified, and the states are very disrespectful to the central government, resulting in their state representatives being frequently absent.
The Italy national football team and the Germany national football team are both the second most successful teams in the world, winning the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international and Olympic competitions.
Japan has nearly 7000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the world's seventh largest island country!
Due to the large number of islands in Japan, it is often referred to as "Archipelago" from a geological perspective.
The Western understanding of Taiwan can be traced back to the 15th century when passing European sailors named the island "Ilha Formosa," meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, changing the indigenous people's food production methods and hiring Chinese workers to work in their rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) military controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, the Qing Empire declared Taiwan a province.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled Taiwan until 1945.
The ancient city of Machu Picchu is composed of three main buildings, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the architectural complex have been rebuilt in order to help visitors better understand the original appearance of the architectural complex.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration work has continued to this day.
For example, the most common static image photography format in the world is the 35mm format, which was the dominant film size at the end of the film era.
Up to now, there is still production, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is applied to the format of digital camera image sensors.
The actual dimensions of the 35mm format are 36mm in width and 24mm in height, which can be a bit confusing.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format series) have the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The frequently abused and ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guide for creating dynamic compositions and keeping images organized.
It points out that the most effective position for the subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the already wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under close scrutiny.
Although the languages and customs of European countries are different, for over a thousand years, Christianity has connected them together.
From the king to the commoner, its influence spreads to everyone in all directions.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's monetary fund is specifically set up for this.
The centralized power system in the Roman Catholic Church existed for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and money has led many to question whether they are adhering to this creed.
After the outbreak of hostilities, the British started to impose a naval blockade on Germany.
They cut off the crucial military and civilian supplies. The fact proves that this strategy is effective, although such a blockade violates the generally accepted international law established by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain lays mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire area, even posing a threat to neutral ships.
Because the response to this strategy is limited, Germany hopes that its unrestricted submarine warfare will also receive a similar response.
In the 1920s, the mainstream attitude of most citizens was pacifist and separatist.
After witnessing the brutality and devastation of the First World War, all countries were eager to avoid repeating the same mistakes.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former manager, written to Thomas Edison.
Different periods of ancient China have their own characteristics; each period or ruling family of China is a distinctive dynasty.
Similarly, during the changes of dynasties throughout history, it was a time of instability and small-kingdom division. The most famous of these periods is the 60-year-long Three Kingdoms period, which occurred between the transitions of the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these turbulent times, war broke out among the various warlords in a fierce competition for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Tens of thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest power in the luxurious palaces of Xi'an.
There are many social and political impacts, such as the use of measurement units, the transition from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not just the rulers.
In addition, after the revolution, official positions were open to applications from all men, which gave the most ambitious and successful people the opportunity to succeed.
The military is the same because ranks are no longer based on seniority, but on ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working classes in different countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad is very interested in things outside of worldly life. He used to often go to a cave called "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself not only survived the test of time, but also brought extremely vivid imagery to Muhammad's spiritual intentions.
The cave is located on a mountaintop in the northern part of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even if you know of its existence, it is not easy to find. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated from the world.
Apart from the clear and beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, nothing can be seen. In the cave, there is almost no sight or sound of the outside world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid is a masterpiece of the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, and it is one of the many large pyramids built to pay tribute to the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza plateau in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt includes several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to commemorate Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to commemorate Khufu's wife and family members.
The "up bow" symbol looks like the letter V, and the "down bow" symbol looks like a push pin or a square missing its bottom edge.
Upward refers to starting to push the bow from the top, and downward refers to starting to pull the bow from the base of the bow (the place where you hold the bow).
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow produces a stronger, more resolute sound.
Please feel free to use a pencil to make your own markings, but remember that the printed notes have musical significance, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and the King's sister Elizabeth were driven back to Paris from Versailles by a group of market women.
They took a carriage back to Paris, where a group of people surrounded them, yelling and threatening the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows completely.
In front of the terrified queen, a thug briefly waved the head of a royal guard, who was killed at the Palace of Versailles.
The war expenses incurred by American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government, to cover most of the expenses, and the interest on bonds issued by Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippines government.
Of course, the high profits obtained from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people have become the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the background that led to the formation of the Knights Templar.
The period in which the event occurred is often referred to as the heyday of European history, namely the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
Before the peak of the Middle Ages was the early Middle Ages, and after was the late Middle Ages. It is conventionally believed that the late Middle Ages ended around the year 1500.
The theory of technological determinism is a term that encompasses many different ideas in practice, including technological determinism, technological essentialism, and a strict definition - the fate of humanity is driven by the underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most explanations of the theory of technological determinism include these two general ideas: firstly, the development of technology itself largely transcends cultural or political influences, and secondly, technology in turn will have an inherent "influence" on society that is not constrained by social conditions.
For example, some people might say that cars will inevitably promote the development of roads.
However, it is not economically feasible to set up a national highway network for only a few cars, so new production methods have emerged to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The high number of vehicles owned by the public will lead to a higher rate of road traffic accidents, which will drive the invention of new medical technology for treating injuries.
Romanticism has a strong cultural determinism, which is originated from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Against the backdrop of romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to geography emerged. These customs and cultures, harmoniously integrated with the social environment, are much better than any imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center for luxury goods dates back to around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century mainly because the gifts brought back by the Crusaders, such as silk and spices, were more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
The title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris at this time.
The Gothic style reached its peak from the 10th to the 11th century to the 14th century.
At first, the dress was deeply influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow cultural exchange, Western fashion may be 25 to 30 years behind.
As the Middle Ages approached the end, the people of Western Europe gradually developed their own style. One of the biggest advancements at the time was that, after the crusades, people began using buttons to fasten their clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is the agricultural activity carried out to produce only enough food to meet the needs of the agricultural workers and their families.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple and typically organic system that utilizes local seeds preserved within the ecosystem, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, in order to maximize yield.
From a historical perspective, the majority of farmers are engaged in self-sufficient agricultural production. This is still the case in many developing countries today.
Subcultures bring like-minded individuals together, as they feel overlooked by societal norms and develop a sense of identity within the subculture.
Given the differences in age, race, class, location, and/or gender among members, subcultures may have their own unique characteristics.
The distinctive qualities that make subcultures unique may be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or multiple factors.
Members of subcultural groups often use symbolic practices and unique styles to express their group identity, including fashion, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods to explain the importance of socialization is to use the cases of a few unfortunate children. These children, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, did not achieve socialization without the help of adults during their growing up process.
Some wild children are confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, children are abandoned because parents refuse to accept their intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
It is said that some people were raised by animals; others live alone in the wild.
If a wolf child is raised entirely by non-human animals, their behavior (within the limits of physical capability) will be very similar to that of the animal, such as showing fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding learning method goes even further.
The scaffold teaching is not a learning method, but a means of assisting people who are just learning to use new computer programs or start new projects.
The scaffolding teaching can be done online or offline, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffolding teaching, just like the paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support internalization in software is used to question, prompt, and explain processes that may be difficult for students to handle alone.
Children are fostered for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
Any child should not grow up in an environment without manners, care, and education, but unfortunately, this is often not the case.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, caring guardians, stable education, and reliable medical care.
The foster system should provide all the essentials that their original family lacks.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet add extra dimensions to its usage and ways of satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are considered important motivators for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
In their study of audience reactions to websites, Ayer and McKay (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "sustained relationships" as new motivational factors.
The use of video has brought significant discoveries in explaining microexpressions (facial movements that last for milliseconds).
Specifically, it is said that one can determine if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks pointed out in his essay "The President's Speech" that people who are unable to understand language due to brain damage can still accurately judge whether the speaker is sincere.
He even suggested that this ability to understand human behavior may be a common ability among animals like pet dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that gene mutations come in two types: dominant and recessive.
Mutation will add new genetic variations, while selection will remove variations from the pool of expressed genetic variations.
Due to segregation and recombination, variations fluctuate between the two populations in each generation.
On the tropical grasslands, primates have a digestive system similar to humans, and the existing plant resources are difficult to meet the primates' needs for amino acids.
In addition, if this cannot be accomplished, it will result in serious consequences: growth inhibition, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant-based resources should be protein from leaves and leguminous plants, but for primates like us, it is difficult to digest this kind of protein unless it is cooked.
On the other hand, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) not only are easy to digest but also can provide a large amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
All in all, if the approach our ancestors used to tackle the "protein problem" is not too different from the methods used by the chimpanzees in the tropical grasslands today, we should not be surprised.
Interrupted sleep refers to the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and then falling back asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This is easy to do, using a relatively quiet alarm to wake you up without completely disturbing you.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock while sleeping, you can put the alarm clock on the other side of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other bio-rhythmic-based choices include drinking a large amount of liquid before bed (especially water or tea - known to have a diuretic effect), and forcing oneself to get up to urinate.
The level of internal peace in a person is opposite to the level of physical and mental tension.
The smaller the pressure, the more active the vitality shows. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach the state of enlightenment, and the only obstacle to achieving it is our own sense of tension and negative emotions.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded through the universal love of Mahayana Buddhism and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes methods of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and universal love.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visual imagery.
The core activity of Tibetan meditation is Sky Yoga. By visualizing different deities, purifying energy channels, and activating chakras, one can achieve the state of enlightenment.
Germany was the common enemy of the various countries in World War II, which promoted cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. As the war ended, conflicts in terms of systems, procedures, and culture caused the two countries to go their separate ways.
Two years after the war ended, former allies have become enemies, and the Cold War began.
This war has lasted for 40 years, and proxy armies have fought with real weapons on many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including in Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses had been breached, and the only remaining hope was to retreat and reorganize the army along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost abandoned overnight, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, after the invasion of the eastern region of Poland, over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered and built fortifications in Belarus and Ukraine.
Up to now, shipping has been the most effective way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
From a traditional perspective, the navy's mission is to ensure the country's ability to transport personnel and goods, while simultaneously disrupting the enemy's ability to transport their personnel and goods.
A prime modern example is the Battle of the North Atlantic during World War II, when Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, with U-boats as the main force, attempted to intercept the transportation.
If the Allied Powers had failed at that time, Germany probably would have conquered England just as it had conquered other countries in Europe.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to domesticate them, consuming and using their milk, meat, fur, and skin.
Family goats are usually herded in groups on mountains or other grazing areas, typically tended by goat herders (mostly children or teenagers), similar to the more widely known shepherds. These herding methods are still in use.
England built the carriage road as early as the 16th century.
Although the Ma-la track car is only made of parallel wooden planks, at that time, these cars could make the pulling horses run faster and pull more on the slightly rough road.
Long ago, rail sleepers were introduced to fix the rails. However, people gradually realized that placing iron plates on the rails would make them more stable and effective.
This became a common practice, but the iron pieces will cause more severe wear and tear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Ultimately, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron track appeared.
The first known mode of transportation is walking. 2 million years ago, with the appearance of Homo Erectus, meaning upright man, humans began walking upright.
Their ancestors, the southern ancient apes, did not have the habit of walking upright.
People have found the phenomenon of bipedal specialization in the fossil of ancient apes in the southern region 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, join the environmental protection movement, and even become active participants in environmental protection, reducing future disasters to some extent.
Many times this is very similar to symptom therapy. However, if we not only want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problem and completely eradicate it.
It is obvious that the world has undergone great changes due to the progress of human science and technology, while overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyle of humans have made the problem even more serious.
The handwritten draft signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4th and then sent to John Dunlap's printing press several blocks away.
Printed 150 to 200 copies overnight, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides" edition.
On July 8th, John Nixon publicly read the document for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and Washington read the letter to his army in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The remaining 25 copies of the Dunlap broadsides are the earliest surviving versions of the document. The handwritten original draft was not preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and has been living until now, which we call "birds".
Many people believe they are not dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still have many similarities with dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a tyrannosaurus rex.
Nowadays, almost all computers in use are based on processing information encoded in binary.
Binary numbers can only take one of two values, either 0 or 1, and such numbers are called binary digits, which are known as "bits" in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not immediately manifest, with symptoms such as vomiting being very common, therefore a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The most powerful indicator of ingesting poison may be containers that have been opened on the scene, containing medication or household toxic chemicals.
Check the label on the poison for specific first aid instructions.
Entomologists use the term "bug" to formally refer to this category of insects.
This term comes from people's familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are very adapted to parasitizing humans.
Assassin bugs and stink bugs are both domiciliary insects, adapted to living in the nests or dwellings of hosts.
In various regions of the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making this disease a major neurological disorder in middle-aged and young people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that the prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) in women is twice that of men.
A couple may decide not to have children for their own benefit or for the benefit of their children.
These couples may make an adoption plan for their child.
During the adoption process, the biological parents terminated their parental rights so that another couple could raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out the way the world works through scientific methods. In fact, this approach can provide guidance for most scientific research.
Experiments are a way to test and eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, but experiments are not the only method. Asking questions and making observations can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on all fields of science (including psychology) have been widely accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West has drifted away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Researchers have observed that many physiological rhythms and behavioral rhythms are largely determined by endogenous cycles generated through the biological clock and their presence.
The periodic rhythm is not simply a simple response to external periodic signals. This rhythm is recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillating device that can continue to operate freely for a period of time even without external cues.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase is one of the main pieces of evidence demonstrating that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into bacteria using bacteriophages or viruses.
They did two experiments, one involving labeling bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus and the other involving labeling bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can produce a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells will be inherited by offspring, while mutations in other cells will lead to cell death or cancer.
The natural scenery tourism industry attracts tourists interested in natural areas, who come to admire the natural landscape, including wildlife and plants.
The on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits, and ecosystem research.
For example, visiting, taking photos, and understanding the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of the small town to go to work, and the people they pass by on the road are heading to the same place they are leaving.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is connected to and supporting the private car-based transportation system in some way.
Today, science shows that this large-scale carbon economy can no longer maintain the stability of the biosphere that has supported human evolution and development for the past 2 million years.
Every person is a part of society and will use the transportation system. And almost every person has complaints about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or bridge collapses of a similar magnitude.
Why does the transportation system trigger such complaints? Why do they malfunction every day? Is it because the transportation engineers are incompetent? Or is there a more fundamental reason?
The study of traffic flow is the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions.
Unfortunately, it is very difficult to study traffic flow because it is impossible to predict the driver's behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to fall within a reasonable range of consistency; therefore, traffic flow often exhibits a certain level of reasonable consistency, which can be roughly represented in mathematical terms.
In order to better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are helpful for the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. The ability to fly makes it easier for them to evade enemies and more effectively find food and mates.
Most insects have an advantage in being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This allows them to have more small areas to hide from predators.
Now, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people believe he is right, but many others hold the opposite view; they think the solar system revolves around the Earth, and the sun (and even other stars) as well.
This seems reasonable because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world and also the largest. Its water volume is more than 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with some sections reaching a width of 6 miles.
The Amazon River accounts for 20% of the total river discharge into the world's oceans.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The river water comes from several thousand smaller tributaries.
Despite the construction of stone pyramids continuing until the end of the ancient kingdom, the grand scale and superior construction techniques of the Giza pyramids have never been surpassed.
During the New Kingdom period, the ancient Egyptians marveled at the monuments left by their predecessors, which had a history of over a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and also the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is also the language used by most people working in the country, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because these elements can be found in a natural form in nature and are relatively easy to mine using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that everything is composed of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (in no particular order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also proposed a theory that they would transform into new substances, forming the things we see.
Alloys are basically made up of two or more metals mixed together. Don't forget one thing, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Calcium, potassium and other elements belong to metals, and silver and gold are also metals.
Some alloys contain small amounts of non-metallic elements (such as carbon).
All things in the universe are made up of material, and all material is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that they can fit trillions of them at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, when the pencil was invented, it became a favorite of many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the status and usage of pencils are decreasing.
People are now writing information on computer screens and never have to touch a pencil sharpener again.
People can only guess what the outcome of the keyboard will be when the updated product appears.
The working principle of a fission atomic bomb is as follows: It takes energy to bring together a nucleus and many protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy little trolley up the mountain. Split the atomic nucleus again and release some energy.
Some atoms have unstable atomic nuclei, which means they are likely to undergo fission with very little or no provocation.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The near side of the crust is about 70 kilometers thick, and the far side is about 100 kilometers thick.
The crust under the dark side is thinner, and the crust under the highlands is thicker.
Because the crust is thinner, there may be more dark areas on the near side, and lava is more likely to rise to the surface.
The core of the content motivation theory is to find factors that are relatable or interesting.
These theories suggest that when people mature to a certain level and enter adulthood, certain needs and/or desires become internalized.
Why do some people want to do what they do, and what in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when managers start leading former colleagues, two types of behavior may appear. One situation is that they will strive to maintain a "close relationship" with team members.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, and also faces challenges in enforcing disciplinary measures, performance evaluations, allocating responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
In another extreme situation, this person would become a completely different individual, feeling the need to change everything the team has done and take credit for the results.
After all, the leader bears the ultimate responsibility for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leader and other members of the team.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are also subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the liaison for their corresponding offline teams.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their team may schedule meeting times for different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The existence of a truly "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
"Invisible team" refers to the management team that each member has to report to. It sets standards for all members.
Why does an organization have to spend so much time establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of putting the concept of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across functional departments of an organization, creativity and originality will occur.
Therefore, an organization's joint efforts to overcome obstacles often lead to new innovative processes to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leaders must create a culture of innovation, share knowledge, and engage in organized learning.
"Angels" (2006) explains the continuous improvement plan as a method that can help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical methods of cognitive research. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes the research more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior can provide support for scientists' research.
We have known for a long time that different types of brain injuries, trauma, lesions, and tumors can affect a person's behavior and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technology enables us to see and study the structure and workings of the brain, which were previously unseen.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials for building a simulation model, which helps us understand the process of brain operation.
Artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction color, but it is actually a very important branch of computer science, studying the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The research of artificial intelligence (AI) involves manufacturing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include the ability to control, plan, and schedule, respond to customer diagnoses and issues, as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and facial functions.
All of these have become independent disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, and some household computers and electronic game software applications already have built-in artificial intelligence systems.
On-site investigation is an important part of any teaching activity. Usually, teachers are willing to take students to places where public transportation is unable to reach.
Virtual field trips are high-tech solutions. Students can observe artificial artifacts in the classroom, visit aquariums, or appreciate exquisite artworks.
Sharing field trips virtually is also a great way to review the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned annually, but old versions are saved online for use as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing ability. Although students' grammar and spelling are often careless when they start blogging, the appearance of readers usually changes this situation.
Students are often the most critical readers, so bloggers have started to work hard to improve their writing skills and avoid criticism.
In addition, writing blogs also "compels students to be more insightful about the world around them". Encouraged by meeting the audience's interests, students become smarter and more interesting.
Writing a blog is a tool that can inspire collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning beyond traditional classroom teaching.
"Appropriate use of blogs can help students become better at analysis and critical thinking; by actively responding to online materials, students can find their own position within the context of others' articles and be able to articulate their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the capital of Canada, full of charm and uses a bilingual system. The highlight is a series of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south is Niagara Falls, while to the north is the undeveloped natural beauty of the Muskoka River and the scenery on the opposite side.
All of these factors have made Ontario the epitome of Canada that outsiders envision.
Further north, the vast areas are sparsely populated, and some places are completely uninhabited wilderness.
A surprising comparison of population data: the number of African American people living in the United States is even greater than the number of citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island so far, it is still an independent continent for wildlife.
Most smaller islands are independent countries or are under French control, and they are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this land, and this religion is prevalent in the countries of Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The northern region borders the Sahel region; the southern and western regions are adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female tourists should say they are married regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can also be helpful (but do not wear a ring that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to behaviors that they perceive as harassment; and being followed or grabbed by the arm is not uncommon.
When rejecting a man, be firm and do not be afraid to stand your ground (regardless of cultural differences, be resolute in your refusal!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and it had been used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenid people, and the port was once called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt the city, naming it Casa Branca, until it was abandoned after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya. Spanish traders established a trading post here and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping places in all of Morocco.
Near the old city of Medina, shops selling traditional Moroccan goods such as Tajine pots, pottery, leather goods, and hookahs can be found everywhere, but these shops are all targeted at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the easternmost part of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano. The lava buried most of the town's streets, especially the town center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any travel outside of Goma should be researched in advance to see if the ongoing fighting in North Kivu Province has eased.
This city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo Volcano and the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking project in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda (rented motorcycle) to tour Goma. The normal (local) price for a short trip is 500 Congolese Francs.
Because of its relative remoteness, "Tibet" is used to metaphorically refer to a distant foreign land.
Today, although Timbuktu's reputation has made it a tourist destination, and there is an airport, it is still a poor town.
In 1990, it was listed on the World Heritage List due to the threat of the desert.
This is an important stop for Henry Louis Gates in the special program "Wonders of the African World" on PBS.
This city contrasts sharply with others in the country because it is more Arabic in style rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, providing support for various wildlife and plant species.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship attraction of the South African National Parks system (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges maintenance and entrance fees every day.
Buying a Wild Card also has many benefits. With this card, you can enter some or all of the national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is synonymous with Hong Kong and is also the focal point for many tourists.
The numerous buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline look like a sparkling bar chart, especially conspicuous against the backdrop of Victoria Harbour.
If you want to enjoy the beautiful scenery of Hong Kong from the best angle, you can leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed land of the northern shore.
This is a place occupied by British colonialists, so if you want to find evidence of the colonial history of this territory, this is a very good starting point.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast to inland Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. This part of the forest within India is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove swamps; there are also remnants of some huge forests that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sun Devil's area is 3850 square kilometers, of which about one third is water/swamp area.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that it is currently home to 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses run all day from the urban interval bus station (across the river), but most of the buses, especially those to the east and to Jackar/Bumtong, run between 06:30 and 07:30.
Due to the frequent full capacity of the shuttle buses, it is recommended to purchase tickets several days in advance.
Most areas can sit in comfortable and sturdy Japanese Coaster mini buses.
To go to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200), sharing a taxi is a fast and comfortable way.
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge spanning the Oyapock River, connecting Brazil's Oiapoque and Saint-Georges in French Guiana.
The two bridge towers are 83 meters high, the length of the bridge is 378 meters, and there are two 3.50-meter-wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The project was completed in August 2011, but did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, by which time the Brazilian customs inspection station is also expected to be completed.
Guaraní people are the most important indigenous group living in the eastern region of Paraguay, they lead a semi-nomadic lifestyle of hunting and gathering, as well as practicing self-sufficient agriculture.
The Chaco region is the homeland of other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who rely on hunting, gathering, and fishing for their livelihood.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was once known as the "Indian Province", a product of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began a three-century-long colonial period.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción, Paraguay has been attempting to preserve many of the local characteristics and features of this city.
Argentina is famous for having the world's top polo teams and players.
The largest tournament of the year is held at the polo field in Las Cañitas in December.
On other days of the year, you can also see smaller tournaments and competitions here.
To learn about tournament news and how to purchase polo match tickets, please visit the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound, which is equivalent to the pound sterling.
You can exchange currency at the island's only bank, which is located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
The pound is generally accepted everywhere on the island, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted within Stanley as well.
In outlying islands, credit cards may not be usable, but British and American currency can be used; please contact the homeowner in advance to confirm acceptable payment methods.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the island, so exchange before leaving the island.
Montevideo is located south of the equator, so when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, it's summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; during the summer months, the temperature often exceeds 30°C.
Winter may feel colder than it looks: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but when wind and humidity combine, it can feel colder than the temperature indicated by the thermometer.
There is no specific "rainy season" or "dry season" here: the annual rainfall is roughly the same.
Although many animals in the park are used to humans, wild animals are still wild animals, and we should not feed or disturb them.
The park management said: Maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
No matter how gentle they may appear, almost all large animals such as wild buffalo, elk, moose, and bears are capable of attacking humans.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured because they fail to maintain a proper distance. These animals are huge, wild, and potentially dangerous, so please give them some space.
In addition, it is important to note that odors can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking food that emits strong odors, and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu, with a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
Except for one British cruiser, all other ships have sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle organized by the Mau movement for independence, a peaceful rally in the town led to the death of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland spans two harbours, so there are many beaches in the area. The most popular beaches are located in three different areas.
The North Shore beaches (located within the North Shore area) are on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
This is almost all beaches, swimming is very safe, and most places have shade from New Zealand Christmas trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located on Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes crowded with vacationing families, and there are various shops lining the coast. Swimming is very safe.
The main local beer is "No. 1" beer. Its taste is not complicated, but very drinkable and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
You can buy a lot of French wine here, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may withstand long-distance transportation better.
The local tap water can fully meet safety drinking standards, but if you are still worried, bottled water is also easily available for purchase.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is still relatively unfamiliar. A small cup of black coffee is called "espresso", the cream in a cappuccino is piled high (not foam), and tea is not served with milk.
The hot chocolate meets the Belgian standard. The juice is expensive, but of good quality.
Many people visit the Great Barrier Reef for tourism throughout the year, and there are very few incidents of injuries due to participating in any of the mentioned activities in the Great Barrier Reef.
Despite this, it is important to heed the advice from the relevant departments, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish will appear on the beaches and river mouths near the town of 1770 between October and April every year. Their presence can also be occasionally detected at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
The main habitat of the saltwater crocodile is not the ocean, but the river mouths in the northern Rockhampton.
Booking in advance can make travelers feel at ease, knowing that they have a place to stay once they reach their destination.
Although travel agencies may help you book camping and other forms of accommodations, they usually work with specific hotels.
Travel agencies usually provide package deals that include breakfast, airport transfers, and some even offer flight and hotel accommodation packages.
If you need time to consider whether the price is appropriate or if you need to obtain other documents (such as a visa) to travel to the destination, they can hold the reservation for you.
If any modifications or requests are needed, they should first be processed through the travel agent, rather than directly contacting the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants choose to camp on-site, and most participants consider this to be an extremely important part of the music festival experience.
If you want to watch the performance up close, you need to arrive early and secure a good spot near the stage.
Remember, although the music on the main stage may have ended, other parts of the festival may continue playing music until late at night.
Some music festivals will set up special camping areas for families with children.
If crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin because navigating on the ice can bring very scary noise to those most affected.
The St. Petersburg cruise includes sightseeing activities within the city. Cruise passengers can obtain visa exemptions (see service terms for details).
The casino will do everything possible to make guests spend as much time and money as possible. Casinos usually have no windows and clocks, and the exit is also hard to find.
They usually provide special food, drinks, and entertainment activities to keep guests happy and stay at the casino.
Some venues provide alcoholic drinks for free. However, getting drunk will weaken one's judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving or crossing mountain passes in high latitude areas should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On the ice and snow covered road, there is little friction, so you cannot drive like you would on a smooth asphalt road.
During a blizzard, the amount of snowfall in a very short time can be enough to trap you.
Snowfall, snow flurries, or water droplets or ice on the car window may also block the line of sight.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather is very common in many countries, and transportation is seldom interrupted throughout the year.
Hunting activities may be the most attractive tourist activity in Africa, and also the highlight of many tourists' itineraries.
The term "safari" commonly refers to traveling by land to observe the amazing wildlife, especially on the tropical grasslands in Africa.
Some animals (such as elephants and giraffes) often like to get close to cars, and standard equipment can allow people to better appreciate them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes very scared of humans, but you can see more clearly with binoculars.
Hiking (also called "jungle trekking", "hiking trip" or "hiking") mainly involves walking on foot, usually taking several hours or lasting for several days.

The stirrups hang on both sides of the saddle and are used to support the rider's feet.
They provide better stability for the rider, but there is also a safety hazard because the rider's feet may get stuck.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but one foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse may drag him while running. To minimize this risk, some precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders will wear heeled riding boots, and the soles are smooth and quite narrow.
Next, some saddles - especially English saddles - are equipped with safety buckles, so if the rider falls off, pulling backwards will cause the stirrup straps to come off the saddle.

In general, it's not necessary to look for discounted business or first class tickets when flying directly from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that some core passengers are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of fast and comfortable travel, so the airlines will accordingly charge a fee.
