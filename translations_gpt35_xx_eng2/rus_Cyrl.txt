This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, but also provides details that are usually not obtainable from fossilized remains, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown on top, and either pale or had carotenoid pigmentation on the bottom.
The finding also allows you to learn about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs lack a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but still have other distinctive features - barbs and barbules - researchers have concluded that the rachis probably appeared later through the evolutionary development of other distinctive features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for regulating temperature and display. Researchers hypothesized that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen presents adult feathers, not chick down.
Researchers suggested that despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, this specimen has the feathers of an adult, not the down of a chick.

Candidates can send their representatives to monitor the entire process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict control in accordance with a special procedure.

Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Kaddebek, 21, were killed. Kaddebek was the driver.
Edgar Vegilla received injuries to his hand and jaw, while Christopher Schneider needed reconstructive surgery on his face.
Uki's weapon malfunctioned when it was aimed at the fifth man's head. Schneider feels constant pain, is blind in one eye, has part of his skull missing, and his face has been reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider gave testimony via video link from the US Air Force base in his homeland.
Besides the team competition on Wednesday, Carpendo took part in two individual competitions at the championships.
Her first competition was a slalom, in the first run of which she did not reach the finish. 36 out of 116 participants had the same result in that race.
In another race, this time in the giant slalom, she finished tenth among women in the sitting position with a combined time of 4:41.30. That is 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first place finisher Claudia Lesh from Austria and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth place finisher Djenji Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers in the sitting group were unable to complete their runs, and 45 out of 117 skiers in the giant slalom were unable to place in the race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh State returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D.K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused have the names Baba Kandzhar, Bhuta Kandzhar, Rampro Kandzhar, and Vishnu Kandzhar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused were presented before the judges with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the building at the time when the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services were freeing the driver from the red Audi TT.
Originally, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently moved to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Subsequently, the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged Adek with the murder of her son.
She is under guard, awaiting charges and a trial, but any witness testimonies may be distorted, as her popularity was widely exploited by the media.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts considered the publication of the photographs potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee points out that "journalists seem to really walk a dangerous line by publishing photos and other data about suspects".
The Royal Prosecutor's Office, which is generally responsible for judicial prosecution, told journalists that no further comments would be made, at least until a guilty verdict is reached.
The document, according to the information leak, will concern the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to establish based on those that existed before the start of the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics reportedly touched upon include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan River Valley.
Israel demands permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to such presence for only five years.
The rangers closely monitored the participants of the additional test on combating pests, as this test was conducted under supervision and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
Qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and heritage at the Wildlife and National Parks Protection Service, four marksmen selected for the first shooting operation have undergone comprehensive training and safety briefing.
Yesterday Martei brought to the oath a new Temporary Election Commission (TEC) consisting of nine members.
This is the fifth CEP Martei in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the previous Temporary Electoral Council to resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the mass protests against the state regime that began in October.
These protests, sometimes accompanied by violence, were caused by the failure to hold elections, some of which were supposed to take place as early as 2011.
There have been about 60 cases of overheating of defective iPod devices, resulting in six fires and four people receiving minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 cases related to these devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Labour and Industry announced that Apple informed it about 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "not serious".
In response, the ministry called Apple's report delay "very regrettable".
At 07:19 in the morning local time (21:19 GMT on Friday), an earthquake occurred in the Mariana Islands.
The Emergency Management of the Northern Mariana Islands stated that there have been no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
The former Philippine police officer hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six were declared dead at the moment.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, as well as Filipino photographers.
Later the photographers took the place of the elderly woman as she went to the bathroom. Mendosa was shot.
Leggings followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He received education as an obstetrician-gynecologist and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When Liggins worked at the hospital, in his free time he began to investigate cases of premature births.
His research showed that if the hormone is introduced, it will enhance the maturation of the child's lungs during fetal development.
As Xinhua reports, on Wednesday state investigators discovered two flight recorders, also known as "black boxes".
Colleagues-wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Here's what Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna became the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. Such a unique event, just like she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "The moon was just as awesome as I am... Maybe even more awesome... I love her and will miss her... Hopefully she's in a better place."
Of the 1400 people surveyed in the run-up to the 2010 federal elections, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent from 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign expressed the opinion that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of those surveyed share this point of view and want Queen Elizabeth II to become Australia's last monarch.
The survey showed the following: 29 percent of respondents are confident that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that it does not need this form of government.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100 and 200 meter freestyle swimming events and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition is now in doubt.
He could not take the necessary medications to ease the pain, as they are prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
On Tuesday it was announced that by the beginning of February several people confirmed this discovery using various hardware and software.
Perhaps comets were the source of water delivery to Earth, as well as a source of organic substances that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, particularly how the Earth formed, as comets collided with the Earth a very long time ago.
53-year-old Cuomo began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriages last month.
He called these rumors "political gossip and stupidity".
It is expected that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration of the United States, will allow airplanes to fly on shortened routes and annually save millions of gallons of fuel, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
She uses satellite technology instead of old ground-based radar technology, which will allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the positions of aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
At Wembley, there is no additional transport running, ground trains will not stop there, and there are also no parking and intercepting facilities on the surface.
Concerns about the lack of transportation raised the assumption that the game might have to be played behind closed doors without spectators.
The study description, published on Thursday in the journal Science, mentions the emergence of a new species of birds on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that due to the mating of the endemic Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortis) with the immigrant cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris), a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer.
Gold can be given any shape. It can be rolled into very small forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be woven and plated. It can be embossed or rolled into rolls.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books - the so-called "facial handwriting".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical substance is.
The pH level is determined by the degree of saturation with hydrogen ions (H in pH) of the chemical compound being studied.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons are separated (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Get a new mixture by mixing two dry powders in one container, and then form a ball from this mixture using clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the top layer, which will be unusual, then a semblance of a shell will form.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewer system.
Fragments of sewer systems have been discovered in the houses of Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away from you, you use satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and almost instantly reflects it back down.
The satellite was delivered into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and view to some extent.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a gigantic rocket over 100 feet tall is required.
The wheel has incredibly changed our world. The most important thing the wheel did for us is to give us much easier and faster transportation.
It gave us a train, a car, and many other means of transport.
Underneath them are a larger number of medium-sized cats that eat small prey from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
And finally, many small cats (including domestic ones that roam around) eat and hunt much more numerous small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the concept of a niche, a special job that each type of cat performs, which keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
The pride consists of one to three adult males, who are related, as well as females and cubs, the number of which can reach up to thirty.
Females usually stay together in kinship and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave very similarly to wolf or dog packs - animals that have remarkably similar behavior to lions (but not other large cats) and are also very dangerous to their prey.
Being a well-rounded athlete, a tiger can climb trees (although not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with the strength of five strong people.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that have the ability to roar.
The roar of a tiger is not similar to the full-bodied roar of a lion, but rather resembles the shouting of sentences made up of incomprehensible words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. If given the opportunity, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow the trail of animals and locate prey by scent, tracking their movement on the ground using their sense of smell.
They are able to see excellently in the dark with the help of night vision and move almost imperceptibly. Ocelots track their prey, blending in with the surrounding environment, and then pounce on their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they were in before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or changes compared to those it had before in order to become a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all - it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, it begins to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Over time, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that it will not be possible to say that they are the same species.
We call this process speciation, that is, the emergence of new species. Speciation is a necessary consequence and a crucial part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants are nourished by the sun through photosynthesis. In addition, they cast shade.
We build our houses and make clothes from plants. The majority of our food is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaur was the most fearsome predator of its time, so it feared no one except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were studded with more than 70 sharp teeth, in addition, there was an additional row on the palate, so those who encountered him had no chance of escape.
We are not sure, but it is not excluded that his language was split. He fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and could have been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur such as a Tyrannosaurus could compare to him.
Despite the fact that most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans still had their own strange and unusual dishes served during feasts. For example, wild boar, peacock, snails, and such type of rodent as dormouse.
There was another difference: while the poor people and women ate while sitting on chairs, the wealthy enjoyed hosting joint feasts, during which they ate while lying on their side.
The diet of ancient Romans could not include products that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in subsequent centuries.
In particular, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman had tried turkey.
The Babylonians built a main sanctuary for each of the gods, considered to be the dwelling place of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to fulfill the desires of the gods at ceremonies and celebrations.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, as elements of the temple, special towers in the form of pyramids called "ziggurats" were built.
The top of the tower represented a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the home didn't hold much value.
The majority of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops had open counters facing the street. Stone was used for the construction of houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and as he moved further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
But regardless of his discovery, at that time there were already settlements of Eskimo tribes living there.
Although each of the countries was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, rulers, traditions, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've watched the movie "National Treasure", you might think that the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence depicted a treasure map.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The reverse side of the Declaration of Independence reads: "This Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776." The text is written at the bottom of the document and upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence, this large parchment document (measuring 29¾ by 24½ inches) was rolled up for easier storage.
Thus, it is quite possible that the record was added simply as a note.
As a result of the "Neptune" operation and subsequent battles, the north of France was liberated, but the south was still not liberated.
He was under the control of the "Vichy" French. These French people made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked together with the invaders instead of resisting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the southern part of France. The invasion was named "Operation "Dragoon"".
In just 2 weeks, the forces of Free France and the Americans liberated southern France and headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a separate culture whose carriers are a fairly large group of people living and working together, society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin civilis, which means "civil" and is related to the Latin words civis, meaning "citizen," and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state," and it also in a certain way expresses the size of society.
Cities-states are the forerunners of nations. Civilization culture implies the transmission of knowledge through several generations, continuous cultural presence, and inheritable dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving behind corresponding historical evidence and therefore cannot be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the War for Independence, thirteen states, in accordance with the Articles of Confederation, first formed a weak central government, the only body of which was Congress.
The Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on the state authorities, which often refused to cooperate and did not want to enforce all of its acts.
He also did not have the authority to repeal state tax legislation and tariffs.
To make amendments, according to the articles, unanimous approval of all states is required, but the states so irresponsibly treated the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, alongside the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions. Residents of Italy from these regions participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
In Japan there are approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
From a geographical point of view, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago due to its belonging to a cluster/group of islands.
Taiwan dates back many years, to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, initiating the transformation of indigenous grain production methods and hiring Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it ceded the rights to Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were reconstructed to give tourists a more accurate representation of how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
For instance, the most widespread format in the world for static photographs is 35mm, and this size was the dominant film size at the end of the analog era.
Today, it is still being produced, but more importantly, its aspect ratio inherited the dimensions of digital camera images.
The 35mm format actually confuses a bit, it has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain a ratio with small whole numbers) is therefore taken as 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) are equal to or closely approximate these proportions.
The rule of thirds, too often used and often mocked, is a simple recommendation that creates dynamism while maintaining a certain amount of order in the image.
It states that it is best to place the main object at the intersection of lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having become wealthy and powerful, became the focus of close attention.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united European states despite differences in languages and traditions.
Her all-pervading power touched everyone - from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources exist precisely for this purpose.
The center of ecclesiastical power was based in Rome for over a thousand years, and such concentration of power and wealth led many to doubt whether this dogma is being upheld.
Shortly after the start of the military actions, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy proved its effectiveness by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated universally accepted international laws outlined in several international agreements over the last two hundred years.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from entering whole sectors of oceans, even endangering neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic was restrained, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unhindered submarine military operations.
Among the majority of citizens and peoples in the 1920s, such moods as pacifism and isolation prevailed.
Having experienced the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the states wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America and accepted an offer to work at Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with four cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor, who was his boss at his previous job, to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, they used a unique method of marking periods of time; each stage of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
In addition, between the reigns of each dynasty, there was fragmentation and instability. The most famous was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years during the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there were fierce military actions between many noble people vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China's history. Thousands of people died fighting for a place on the throne in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, work opportunities opened up for all men, which allowed the most ambitious and talented to achieve success.
The same applies to the army, as ranks have come to be based on merit rather than on heritage.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed representatives of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in topics not related to worldly life. He often visited a cave, which became known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light) for contemplation.
Well, the cave that has survived to this day, gives us a very vivid idea of the spiritual aspirations of Muhammad.
The cave is located at the top of the mountain to the north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is very difficult to find her, even for those who know of her existence. In the cave, a person finds themselves in complete isolation.
You can see and hear only a very small part of this world from the depths of the cave.
The Great Pyramid in Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that exists today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE and is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the memory of the pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the Giza Necropolis, in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
The upward movement of the bow looks like V, and the downward movement of the bow looks like a bracket or a square without the bottom side.
"Up" means that you should start from the tip and move the bow forward, while "down" means that you should start from where your hand holds the bow and move it back.
The upward movement of the bow usually produces a softer sound, while the downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
You can draw your own hatching, but remember that hatching is printed for musical reasons and it is usually worth following it.
On October 6, 1789, an angry crowd of women from the market forced Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister Madame Elizabeth to return to Paris from Versailles in horror.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting threats to the king and queen.
A crowd of people forced the King and Queen to open the windows wide.
At some point, one of the participants in this crowd shook the head of the royal guard who was killed in Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The military expenses of American imperialism for conquering the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime in order to cover most of the expenses and interest on bond loans, transferred on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking firms.
Of course, the superprofits brought by the long exploitation of the Filipinos constituted the main income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led them to create the order.
The era in which these events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history covering the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages succeeded the earlier Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted viewpoint, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from technological progress or technological imperative to a strict point of view that the fate of people is driven by fundamental logic associated with the laws of science and their manifestation in technologies.
Most views on technological determinism share two common ideas: that the direction of technological development is practically beyond cultural or political influence and that, in turn, the "impact" of technologies on society is determined by their own properties, not by society.
For example, one could say that the car is a necessary reason for the development of roads.
However, the national road network is economically disadvantageous only for a small group of cars, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in the number of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new methods for treating injuries in healthcare.
Romanticism largely included cultural determinism drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and culture associated with it emerged, which, in harmony with the place of residence of the society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just like Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
Glory to him as the center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
His status declined throughout the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued higher than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
At this moment, the title of Fashion Capital transitioned from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was under the strong influence of Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles may lag behind by 25-30 years.
Own styles began to develop in Western Europe by the end of the Middle Ages. One of the greatest achievements of that time, thanks to the Crusades, was the use of buttons for fastening clothes.
Natural farming is farming aimed at producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Natural agriculture is a simple, often organic, farming system that uses seeds of plants that grow in the ecosystem, along with the use of crop rotation and other relatively simple methods to increase productivity.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in agriculture for subsistence, and this is still observed in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel oppressed by society's standards and allow such people to define who they are for themselves.
Differences between subcultures can be influenced by age, nationality, social status, place of residence, and/or gender of the people it consists of.
Characteristics that define a subculture as separate can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Representatives of a specific subculture often declare their belonging through a unique and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is the illustration of several unfortunate cases, when children, due to lack of proper attention, unfortunate circumstances, or deliberate cruel treatment, did not interact with adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "feral" or "wild". Some feral children were isolated by humans (usually their own parents). In some cases, such rejection of their child was the result of the parents not accepting their serious intellectual or physical deficiency.
Children living on the streets may have experienced severe forms of violence or trauma before running away or being abandoned.
Others, as it is claimed, were raised by animals; some of them lived in the wild independently.
If he is completely raised by animals instead of humans, a feral child demonstrates behaviors (within physical limitations) that are almost identical to the particular animal that raised him - for example, his fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should be simpler and more engaging, scaffolding surpasses many technologies.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method but rather a form of support for those going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is Clippy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding, assisting in learning, is built into the software and is designed to remind, explain, and ask questions about procedures that the learner may find too difficult to handle alone.
Children are placed under guardianship for a variety of reasons: from being orphaned to cruel treatment and even extortion.
Children should never have to grow up in an environment where they are not provided with proper upbringing, care, and education, but they do.
We consider the foster care system to be safe for children.
Our foster care system should provide safe housing, loving guardians, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Patronage care should provide all the needs that were missing in the home from which they were previously taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional levels in terms of approach to usage and satisfaction.
So, the idea is expressed that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivating factors for using the internet (James et al., 1995)
"Personal involvement" and "long-term contacts" were also named by Aimi and McCord (1998) as new facets of motivation when they studied how people reacted to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions - facial movements lasting just milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
In the article "Presidential Speech," Oliver Sacks described how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can still correctly assess the sincerity of the speaker.
According to his assumption, animals, for example, domestic dogs, may possess similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research conducted in the 20th century showed that there are two types of genetic variability: hidden and expressed.
Mutation introduces a new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the set of manifesting variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations between two gene pools with each generation.
In the savannah, primates with a digestive system similar to humans find it difficult to meet their amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so will lead to such serious consequences as slowed growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most accessible plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are poorly absorbed by primates such as us if not cooked.
On the other hand, animal origin food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also represents a rich source of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
Taking into account all of the above, it's not surprising that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees in the savanna still do to this day.
Interrupted sleep is the process of purposeful awakening during regular sleep and falling back asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done with the help of a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biological rhythms include consuming large amounts of fluids (particularly water or tea, known for its diuretic properties) before bed, which causes a person to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace in a person is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present in you. Each person potentially has the ability to achieve absolute peace and a sense of satisfaction.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negative mindset.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was supplemented by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
The kundalini (enlightenment energy) is awakened in kundalini yoga through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is considered to be Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and enlightenment of consciousness is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, disagreements about the system, process, and culture led to discord between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
She was to last for the next 40 years. In her, real wars were fought, using proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places in the world.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been breached, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became irrelevant practically overnight when around 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the occupation of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is unquestionably the most efficient method for transporting large quantities of people and cargo across oceans.
The work of sailors traditionally involves ensuring the country's ability to move its people and goods, while also preventing the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this was the company in the North Atlantic during the Second World War. The Americans attempted to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to assist Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using its submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain just like the other countries in Europe.
Goats, apparently, were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes started keeping them for themselves to have milk, wool, meat, and hides at hand.
The domestic goats were usually kept in herds, which roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often watched over by goatherds, who were usually children or teenagers, resembling a more common job of a shepherd. These grazing methods are still used to this day.
The roads for carriages were constructed in England as early as the XVI century.
Although the cart roads were just logs of wood placed parallel to each other, they allowed horses to transport larger loads on them at a faster speed than on the slightly more uneven roads of that time.
Sleepers have been used for a long time to keep the rails in place. However, it later became clear that tracks were more effective with a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wagon wheels.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The first known form of transportation was walking, people began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
For their ancestors, the Australopithecus, walking upright was not so familiar.
Bipedal specializations are found in the remains of Australopithecus from the era 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living, caring more about the environment. We can become members of the ecological movement and even become activists to at least alleviate future suffering a little.
As a rule, this is similar to treating symptoms. If we need more than just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed significantly under the influence of the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people, problems have become more widespread.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
Overnight, 150-200 copies were produced, now known as "Danlap leaflets".
The first public reading of this document was made by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
On July 6, one copy was sent to George Washington, who on July 9 ordered it to be read to his troops in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
"25 leaflets of Danleap, known at the present time, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not reach us."
Today many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lived up to our days. We call them birds.
They are often not considered as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and are capable of flying.
But there is still much to say about birds, which still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly paws and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers that are used today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
The binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary digits" - or "bits", if you use computer slang.
It may be difficult to immediately detect oral poisoning. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general for a quick diagnosis.
The presence of an open container with medication or toxic household chemical substances can be the best indicator of internal poisoning.
Familiarize yourself with the label, which provides specific instructions for administering first aid in case of poisoning with this particular poison.
The term "beetle" is formally used by entomologists to refer to a group of insects.
This concept originates from the well-known bedbugs - insects perfectly adapted for parasitizing on humans.
Both predators and bed bugs are nest-dwelling species adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the USA, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been discovered, making MS the main neurological disease of young people and middle-aged individuals.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that twice as many women suffer from multiple sclerosis as men.
The couple may decide that raising a child does not meet their interests or their child's interests.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
When a child is adopted or fostered, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take the child in.
The main goal of science is to determine how the world is structured using the scientific method. This method effectively underlies most scientific research.
However, he is not the only one. Scientific research is also guided by experimentation (an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions, and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on ancient texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
In all scientific matters, including psychology, Aristotle's views were adopted.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend significantly on the presence of endogenous cycles and their generation through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, not simply a reaction to external periodic stimuli, are registered in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue autonomous cyclicity over a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the first indications that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their DNA into a bacterium using phages, i.e. viruses.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus and the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can cause a wide variety of results, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected segment of genetic material, and whether the mutated cells are germ line cells.
Only mutations in the embryonic cell line can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism is interesting for those who love to go into nature to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
Among the examples of active recreation at the facility are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
Visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo can serve as an example.
Every morning people leave small rural towns to go to their place of work, while others drive past them whose place of work is in the place they have just left.
In this active transportation movement, everyone is in some way connected to the transportation system based on personal cars and supports it.
Currently, science indicates that the huge hydrocarbon economy has affected one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Every person is a member of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about these systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why are there so many complaints about transportation systems, why do they break down every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or are there more fundamental reasons for this?
The study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out within the framework of traffic flow research.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the intensity of traffic movement, because it is impossible to predict the driver's behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers' behavior is often quite systematic; thus, traffic flows in general have some systematicity and can be approximately described mathematically.
To better understand the traffic flow, relationships were established between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of railway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape from enemies, find food, and mates more easily.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their body, giving them an advantage.
This provides them with a greater number of secluded places to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and damselflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Many thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems like a reasonable idea because we don't feel that the Earth is moving, don't we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the amount of water compared to the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching a width of six miles.
Twenty percent of all the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. Thousands of small rivers flow into it.
Despite the fact that the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed.
In the new kingdom of the ancient Egyptians, they admired the monuments created by their predecessors over a thousand years ago.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, as well as the country with the smallest population.
In the Vatican, Italian language is used in legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language for most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Catholics.
People from ancient times were familiar with the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, as they can all be found in nature in their pure form and relatively easily extracted with primitive tools.
Philosopher Aristotle believed that everything consists of a combination of one or several of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
They were similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also suggested that they transition into a new state to produce what we see.
Alloys essentially represent a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Such elements as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
It is also possible to create alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
All in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of the smallest particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil became a good friend to many people when it appeared.
It's sad that when new ways of writing appeared, the pencil lost its former status and started being used less.
People are now writing messages on computer screens and never have to deal with a pencil sharpener.
It is only possible to guess what will happen to the keyboard with the emergence of newer technologies.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that in order for many protons and neutrons to be present in one nucleus, energy is required.
Roughly like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Then the repeated fission of the nucleus releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no external influence.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust thickness is about 70 km under the oceans and 100 km under the continents.
She is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there may be more lunar seas because the crust is thinner there. Lava found it easier to rise to the surface.
Theories of content are focused on finding what makes people act or can interest them.
These theories assume that people have certain needs and/or desires that accumulate within them during the process of growing up.
These theories address what makes specific individuals want to do what they do, and what in their environment compels them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories about content are "Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs" and "Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory of Motivation".
: Typically, two types of behavior can occur when managers begin to lead people who were previously equal to them in status. One extreme of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
Managers find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary actions, evaluate work results, allocate responsibilities, and hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes unrecognizable individual, who feels that he should change everything that the team did and claim it as his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Such behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are some small differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They are usually more autonomous than employees from traditional teams, as their teams may interact according to different time zones, which local management may not always understand.
The presence of a "real invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"Invisible team" is a team of leaders, to whom every member is accountable. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why do organizations go through the laborious process of creating a self-learning organization? One of the goals of applying the concepts of self-learning organizations in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized in all functional departments of the organization, creativity and innovation can emerge.
The cohesive work of the organization aimed at overcoming obstacles can lead to a new innovative process that will meet the interests of the client.
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and experience accumulation.
Angel (2006) explains the "Continuum" approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of effectiveness.
The data of neurobiology provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to studying consciousness. Thus, the scope of research is narrowed, and it becomes much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen structures and processes of the brain.
This gives us a large amount of data and materials for creating simulation models to help understand the processes occurring in our consciousness.
Despite being firmly associated with science fiction, AI is forming a very important direction in computer science, examining the behavior and learning of machines and "instilling" intelligence in them.
Research in the field of AI includes creating machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Here are some examples that can be given: control, planning and scheduling, responding to diagnoses and client questions, as well as recognizing faces, handwriting and voices.
Such questions are addressed in separate disciplines, the purpose of which is to solve the problems we encounter in everyday life.
Currently, AI system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military sector, being embedded in some software applications for home computers and video games.
Educational excursions are very important for any class. Teachers often want to take their students where they cannot go by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual excursions. Students can explore museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or enjoy beautiful art, all while sitting with their class.
Posting a tour in virtual space for public viewing is also an excellent way to refresh the memory of the tour and share your knowledge with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the state capital, and each year this website is updated, but access to the old versions is still preserved - they serve as a memorial album.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blog using sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes due to the presence of an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive for improvement in their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, through blogging, "students begin to better understand the world around them." Students are inspired to be smart and interesting, attracting the attention of readers (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that fosters collaboration, and it motivates students to extend the knowledge acquisition process far beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs can give students the opportunity to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to internet materials, students can define their position in the context of others' work and also express their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming bilingual capital of Canada with a huge number of art galleries and museums, revealing the past and present of Canada.
To the south is the Niagara Falls, while the north is the domain of untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and the surrounding areas.
All this and much more makes Ontario truly Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
Large areas further to the north are quite rarely populated, and some of them are practically uninhabited wilderness.
An amazing comparison of population: in the USA there are more African Americans than citizens in Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than the others and is a unique continent in terms of its wild nature.
Almost all smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this region, especially it took root in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The spread of European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the route through the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west - by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: all female tourists are recommended to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (just not too expensive-looking).
Women should be aware that due to cultural differences, it may appear to them that they are being pursued, women are often followed, grabbed by the hand, and so on.
Firmly refuse men and do not be afraid to stand your ground (this is unacceptable regardless of cultural differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. It was used by the Romans, Phoenicians, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Caza-Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city called Ed-Dar-el-Beyda, and Spanish merchants, who established trading bases here, named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole assortment of trinkets are sold, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried a large part of the city streets, especially the central part of the city.
Although Goma is a relatively safe place, it is important to gather information in advance about any trips outside of Goma in order to understand the current state of the conflict in the North Kivu province.
This city also serves as a starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, and here you can also see mountain gorillas in the wild at one of the lowest prices in Africa.
You can go to Goma by bodaboda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for an exotic distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites under threat from the danger of desert sands.
During the shooting of Henry Louis Gates' show "Wonders of the African World" on PBS, one of the most important stops was made here.
This city differs greatly from other cities in the country, as it is predominantly Arabic in character, rather than African.
The Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa, along the border with Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park's area is 19,500 km²; 14 different ecozones are designated within it, each of which is a habitat for various wild animals.
He is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the leading among South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like in all South African national parks, there is a daily fee for its protection and visitation in this park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows you to visit South African national parks either selectively or all of them.
The territory of Hong Kong was named after the island of Hong Kong, a place that many tourists consider their main attraction.
The string of buildings forming the skyline of Hong Kong is compared to a sparkling column chart, emphasized by the water of Victoria Bay.
To see the most picturesque places of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the coast of the Kowloon Peninsula, which is opposite.
The majority of the urban development districts on Hong Kong island are tightly concentrated on reclaimed land on the northern shore.
This is a place that British colonizers took for themselves, and if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangrove forests, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the shore in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 sq. km, of which approximately one-third is covered with water or marshes.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and according to estimates, it currently houses 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although the majority, especially those heading east and to Djakar/Bumtang, depart from 06:30 to 07:30.
Since inter-city buses are often crowded, it is advisable to purchase a ticket several days in advance.
The majority of the districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are convenient and reliable.
The minibus is a fast and convenient way to reach nearby places such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers reach a height of 83 meters, while the bridge itself is 378 meters long and has two lanes with a width of 3.5 meters.
The height of the clearance under the flyover is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group, inhabiting the area now occupied by eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced natural agriculture.
The Chaco region served as home to various groups of local tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, which had been called "a huge province of East India" before, arose as a result of the clash between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to preserve much of its unique character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams, as well as the best players in the world in the sport of polo.
The largest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be watched here at another time of the year.
To find out news about polo matches and where to buy tickets for them, visit the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on these islands, which is located in Port Stanley across from the FIC West store.
As a rule, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands. In Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; clarify in advance with the owners which method of payment is acceptable.
Currency of the Falkland Islands is almost impossible to exchange outside of the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, the air temperature above +30°C is a common occurrence.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity creates a feeling of colder weather compared to what the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons here: the amount of precipitation is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, nature is still wild, so do not feed or disturb the animals.
Park administration warns: do not approach bears and wolves closer than 100 yards/meters, and other wild animals closer than 25 yards/meters!
No matter how tranquil they may look, bison, elk, bears, and practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they do not maintain the necessary distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so please respect their personal space.
In addition, remember that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid cooking or carrying fragrant food with you, and also maintain cleanliness in the camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the bay.
All ships sank except for one British cruiser. Around 200 American and German sailors perished.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Maau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are plenty of beaches here, as Auckland is situated on the shores of two harbors. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbor area) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and many of them are shaded thanks to trees such as the pochutukawa.
In the central district of Auckland, where the prestigious residential suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers are located in Waitemata Bay, the Tamaki Drive beaches stretch out.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops located along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The most popular local beer is "Number One", it has a simple, pleasant and refreshing taste. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that can be enjoyed, however New Zealand and Australian wines can transport better.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you are still concerned, it will be easy to find bottled water.
Australians do not understand the concept of "flat white". "Long black" is espresso, cappuccino is served with a thick layer of whipped cream (not froth), and tea without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although fruit juices are expensive, they have excellent quality.
A large number of trips are made to the reef year-round, and injuries caused by any of these reasons on the reef are rare.
Still, follow the recommendations of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The cube jellyfish is found near beaches and river mouths north of 1770 from October to April. Sometimes they can be encountered outside of this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Ridged crocodiles do not lead an active life in the ocean, and their main habitat is the estuaries of rivers to the north of Rockhampton.
Preliminary booking allows the traveler not to worry about where to stay upon arrival at the destination.
Tour agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you can also book through a tour agent and other forms of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Travel agents usually sell package deals that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined packages including flights and hotel accommodation.
In addition, they can hold the reservation if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for the destination (e.g. visas).
Any changes or requests should be sent to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants stay overnight right on the festival grounds, and most of them consider it a mandatory part of the program.
If you want to be close to the stage, you need to arrive early to find a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages may have already ended, there may be areas at the festival where the music will continue to play until late at night.
At some festivals there are special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, find out about the location of the cabin, as passage through the ice leads to quite a scary noise that can disturb the sleep of the most sensitive people.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include city tours. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually make every effort to make visitors spend as much time and money in the establishment as possible. There are no clocks or windows, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and not leave the establishment.
Some establishments offer free alcohol. However, intoxication clouds judgment, and all good players know the importance of staying sober.
All those planning to travel through high latitude areas or mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and you will not be able to drive the car as you would on regular asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow to get stuck can fall in a very short period of time.
Visibility can also be limited due to snowfall, blizzard, condensation, or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, snowy and icy weather conditions are normal in many countries, and road traffic continues almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest lure for tourists in Africa and the main event for many travelers.
The term "safari" in everyday usage means a ground trip with the aim of seeing the stunning wild nature of Africa, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, often come close to vehicles, so even with regular equipment, you can get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes cautious, and you can get a better look at them through binoculars.
Walking safari (also known as "bushwhacking", "hiking safari" or "walking tour") consists of a hike lasting from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will become the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice. The first time was in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the rescheduling was announced, you may encounter a difficult situation.
The rules for canceling orders may vary, but as of the end of March, most of the rules related to the coronavirus do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with the standard ticket price around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes helps them dry. Many hotels offer iron and ironing board rental, even if they are not in the room.
If you do not have an iron on hand or are not thrilled about the idea of wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if you have one.
Do not expose the fabric to too high temperatures (which may result in shrinkage or, in very rare cases, burning).
There are different methods of water purification, some of them are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is enough, in others it will take several minutes.
The filters are effective in different ways, and in case of doubt, you should consider buying water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they have not seen in their native lands.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, worse, trigger allergic reactions, release toxins, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals capable of causing harm or death to humans are generally not considered pests.
"Shopping duty-free" is an opportunity to buy goods in certain points without taxes and excise duties.
Travelers heading to high-tax countries can sometimes save a significant amount, especially on items such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated, remote and wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be on the lookout: steep slopes, narrow streets and sharp turns predominate.
The speed limits set here are noticeably lower than on previous and subsequent sections- usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h)- and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
However, surprisingly, mobile phone service is much better here than in many other parts of the route, for example in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good. In Bavaria, it is very abundant and diverse and resembles the pastry of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are popular, apple pastries are available year-round, and cherry and plum pastries appear in the summer.
In German baking, almond, hazelnut, and other tree nuts are often used. Popular cakes often go well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small, but filling pastry products, try what is called in some regions as pancakes or filled donuts.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the liquid content, curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the inner regions of Pakistan and Northern India, yogurt is actively used in curry. In South India and certain regions on the coast of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
Indonesian cuisine, with 17,000 islands to choose from, is a common term used to denote a huge variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But without clarification, this term most often refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, widely spread throughout the archipelago today, includes a variety of simply seasoned dishes. Javanese people prefer such flavorings as peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are the supports for the rider's feet, hanging from both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but there may be safety issues as there is a possibility of getting trapped by the legs.
If a horse throws off the rider but his foot gets stuck in the stirrup, the running horse can drag him along. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear boots for horseback riding with heels, with a smooth and fairly thin sole.
In addition, individual saddles, especially English ones, are equipped with safety loops, thanks to which the leather stirrup falls off the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamo Valley is the main destination in Chile for mountaineering. It is known as the South American Yosemite and has a large number of big granite walls and cliffs.
At the top, you can enjoy stunning mountain landscapes. Climbers from all over the world continuously create new routes in its huge potential for mountaineering.
Mountain winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending on snowy terrain on attached skis or snowboard.
Skiing is the main tourist attraction for many ski enthusiasts (they are sometimes also called "ski bums") who plan to fully focus their vacation around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock drawings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or skiing on skis.
This is related, but usually does not include climbing to the summit on foot and then skiing down unprepared slopes, as backcountry skiing requires stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine that a ski route is a walking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover much larger distances than when walking, but such speed on skis will only be achievable in extremely rare cases when you don't have a heavy backpack and there is a groomed trail.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would require the submission of visa applications and multiple passport controls.
But the Schengen area in this respect functions as a single country.
When in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each of the Schengen Agreement countries separately, which will save you time and money, and also avoid paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what products are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods that are over 100 years old as antiques.
This concept has geographical variations, in which the age boundary in places like North America may be lower than in Europe.
Craft items can be considered as antiques, despite the fact that they are younger in age compared to similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this type of activity is also important for many other professions.
Although it is a tradition, not all representatives of the Sami people were involved in mass reindeer breeding; they lived by fishing, hunting, and other similar industries, using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today many Sami people are engaged in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region of Lapland.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Gypsies, it is often considered offensive due to associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Romani people.
If the country you are planning to visit has travel warnings in place, it may affect your travel medical insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult with other governments besides your own, but their recommendations are aimed at their own citizens.
Here is one example: US citizens in the Middle East may encounter situations that Europeans or Arabs may not encounter.
The political situation in one country is only briefly described in the news messages.
The opinions expressed are often superficial, vague, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information widely available.
Adverse weather conditions are a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon capable of causing damage, causing serious social disruption, or leading to human casualties.
Adverse weather conditions occur everywhere around the world, and they come in various forms, depending on the geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, abundant precipitation, and wildfires are manifestations and effects of severe weather phenomena such as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to take into account any risks associated with harsh weather in their area, as they may impact any travel plans.
Everyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
Searching the internet for the phrase "course on security in a hostile environment" may yield the address of a local company.
The course usually covers in much more detail all the topics mentioned here, often with hands-on training.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing situations, a large amount of information on providing first aid, and sometimes training with weapons.
Books and magazines featuring survival in the wild are common, but there are few publications about combat zones.
People planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should make sure they have valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without specifying gender (X) or documents updated to include the desired name and gender varies in different locations.
The readiness of foreign governments to fulfill their obligations under these documents is also very diverse.
Inspections at the checkpoint have also become much more thorough after the events of September 11, 2001.
Transgender people preparing for surgery should not expect to be able to pass through scanners without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Rebound current is a current created by waves breaking on the shore, or sometimes on a reef or something similar.
The backflow is concentrated in several deeper areas, where fast-moving currents can form, heading into deeper waters due to such underwater topography.
The majority of deaths occur as a result of exhaustion while trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back will be no harder than usual.
Try to go where you won't be caught again, or depending on your skills and whether you were noticed, you may need to wait for rescue.
The shock upon returning to one's native country occurs earlier than culture shock (here is a shorter, more romantic period), lasts longer, and may be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to readjust to their own native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you are adapted to a new culture and have lost some customs of your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people most likely treated you with patience and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adapt in a new country.
It might be unexpected for people that patience and understanding are necessary to show to travelers returning home.
The sound and light show against the backdrop of the pyramid is one of the most interesting events in this area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can also see them in the silence before the show starts.
Usually there is always noise from tourists and sellers. The history of sound and light is like a book of stories.
The sphinx serves as the backdrop and narrator of the long story.
Scenes show on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were opened in 1819, are claimed by several countries. These islands have the most bases, and in 2020 sixteen of them were operational.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers from the peninsula. The largest island is named King George with the settlement of Villa-las-Estrolyas.
Other include Livingston Island and Deception, where the submerged caldera of an active volcano still presents an impressive natural harbor.
The Elsuert Land is a region to the south of the Antarctic Peninsula, washed by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of this peninsula here merge with the plateau, and then rise again to form the 360-kilometer Ellesmere mountain system, divided by the Minnesota Glacier into two parts.
In the northern part, that is, on the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains of Antarctica - the Vinson Massif, the highest point of which reaches 4892 meters and is called Mount Vinson.
In remote areas outside the coverage of mobile communication, a satellite phone may be your only option.
As a rule, a satellite phone is not a substitute for a mobile phone, because you need to be outside in direct line of sight with the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including pleasure and high-speed vessels, where there is a need for remote data transmission and voice communication.
As a rule, you can obtain additional information about connecting this service by contacting your local telephone operator.
The option becoming increasingly popular for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and study.
This is especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before entering university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during academic leave can really increase your chances of admission to higher education institutions in your home country.
As a rule, tuition fees are charged for admission to such educational programs.
Finland is a great place for boating tourism. In the "land of a thousand lakes" there are also thousands of islands on the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
Exploring archipelagos or visiting lakes, you can easily do without a yacht.
Coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes can really accommodate any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks leave completely different impressions.
Boat racing is a national form of leisure in Finland. In particular, one boat is shared between seven or eight people.
The situation is similar in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but in other cases it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands this value ranges from one to forty).
Most individual Baltic cruises include an extended stop in the Russian city of St. Petersburg.
This means that you can spend several full days in this historic city and stay overnight – return to the ship.
If you go to the shore only as part of a boat tour, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is located far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be intimidating for people of any age and social status, especially if it is their first flight or if they have had any traumatic past experiences.
There is no shame in this: it is no different from personal dislike and fear of other things that many people have.
Understanding how the aircraft works and what happens during the flight can help overcome the fear that arises from the unknown or the inability to control the process.
Delivery services pay well for quickly completing deliveries. Often the speed of delivery of commercial documentation, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs is very important.
On some routes, larger companies have their own airplanes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem with this.
If they were shipping anything as air freight, then on some routes, unloading and customs clearance could take several days.
The only way to deal with it faster is to send it as checked baggage. The airline regulations do not allow sending baggage without a passenger, so we need your participation here.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is to splurge on this privilege (or, for a better option, to make your company pay for you).
However, this is quite expensive - based on rough estimates, you will pay four times more than usual economy class for business and eleven times more for first class!
As a rule, it doesn't even make sense to look for discounts on business class or first class for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a specific core group of passengers who are willing to pay a hefty sum for the privilege of quickly and comfortably getting somewhere, so they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has become a victim of ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in the east of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million people, the largest port after Istanbul and an excellent transportation hub.

Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, modern shopping centers are interspersed with places with traditional red tiled roofs, an 18th century market, old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldorsvik there is a view of the nearby island of Esturoy, as well as the unusual octagonal church is located in it.
In the church cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above some of the graves.
It is worth spending half an hour and taking a walk around the unusual village.
The romantic and charming town of Sintra, praised by Lord Byron and gaining worldwide fame after that, is relatively not far away, to the north.
The Scotturb bus number 403 operates regular routes to Sintra and makes a stop at Cabo da Roca.
North of here, you will also visit the great Temple of the Fatima Mother of God (the burial place) - the site of the world-famous apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Please remember that you are, in principle, at the site of a mass grave, as well as a place that is indescribably important for a significant percentage of the earth's population.
There are still many men and women alive who have survived their time here, but there are even more people whose loved ones were killed here or worked here to death, whether they were Jews or people of other nationalities.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust and Nazis.
Do not defile this place by applying or scratching graffiti on the surrounding objects.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only indicated in Catalan, as it is by law the first official language.
However, the Spanish language is also widely used in public transport and other public places.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
While often just a false stereotype, the best way to succeed in Paris is to behave in the best manner possible, as a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) person. This will significantly facilitate adaptation in this city.
The unfriendly exterior of Parisians will immediately disappear once you show a little basic politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily overgrown with forest, mainly beech, spruce, and fir, and represents a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to the combination of microclimates, different soils, and altitude variations, it features a particularly wide variety of plant communities.
The area abounds with a huge variety of different types of animals and birds.
Here you can meet rare representatives of the fauna, for example, the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, as well as many other common species of animals.
When visiting monasteries, women should be dressed in skirts below the knee and with covered shoulders.
In most monasteries, they provide clothing for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that would cover the knees.
You can also take them at the entrance, but this clothing is not washed after each use, so you may feel uncomfortable in these skirts. One size fits all men!
The cuisine of Mallorca, as well as the cuisines of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on vegetables, bread, and meat (especially pork), and extensively uses olive oil.
A simple and popular lunch dish, especially in the summer, is Panzanella: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available filling, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word "Sie" meaning "you," are always written with a capital letter even in the middle of a sentence.
It is important to differentiate between verbs and objects.
This also likely simplifies reading, while writing becomes slightly more complicated by determining whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantivized form.
The pronunciation in the Italian language is relatively simple, as the majority of words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
One must be especially careful with the letters c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Don't forget that r and rr are pronounced differently: caro means "expensive", while carro means "carriage".
In the Persian language, the grammar is relatively easy and mostly regular.
Therefore, reading this textbook on Persian grammar will help you to learn a lot of new things and better understand expressions.
It is obvious that if you speak a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough and can be not learned separately.
Ancient observatories are generally considered outdated today and serve as museums or educational institutions.
Since light pollution during their flourishing period was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, which are easier to access than those built in our time.
Most modern research telescopes are huge constructions in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Contemplating the blooming of cherry blossoms, called "hanami", has become a part of Japanese culture as early as the 8th century.
This idea came from China, where the favorite flower was the plum blossom.
In Japan, the first celebrations of cherry blossom blooming were arranged by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural habitat, so resist the temptation to take at least one specimen.
When visiting an officially organized garden, collecting "samples" will also result in being kicked out without any conversation.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, easy to navigate, and practically everything can be purchased upon arrival.
But, being in the "deep tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to cope with both heat (constantly) and strong sun (under cloudless sky, less often).
There are also several buses going north to Hebron - the legendary burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are about to get on is heading to Hebron, not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Internal waterways can be a good topic for holding any celebration.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, taking a cruise sightseeing tour on the Danube, or traveling by boat on the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular pedestrian and bicycle routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the day of Jesus' birth.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and those not belonging to Christianity worldwide.
There is a tradition to spend the Easter night without sleeping, in some open place, in order to see the sunrise.
Of course, this tradition has a Christian theological explanation, but it could also be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter service on Saturday evening during Easter weekend, with parishioners typically beginning the celebration of the Resurrection of Christ at midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived on these islands either swam, flew, or were carried by the currents.
Because of the large distance from the continent, mammals could not reach there, making the giant tortoise the main herbivorous animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of humans on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, you will experience what is a polar night when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This represents a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, because the sky will be more or less dark around the clock.
Since these areas are sparsely populated, and as a result, light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Western residents are accustomed to.
Costumes are the standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is extremely important, and the results of group work are valued more than individual achievements.
Employees are usually required to obtain permission from their supervisor before making any decisions and are obligated to unquestioningly carry out the supervisor's orders.
