Ring also reached an out-of-court settlement with a competing security company, ADT Corporation.
Although the evidence suggests that an experimental vaccine is capable of reducing mortality caused by Ebola, up to now, no medication has clearly demonstrated its ability to treat this infection.
A cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, initially showed promising results in that field, but other formal studies indicated that it offered fewer benefits than expected in preventing mortality.
In the trial against PALM, ZMapp acted as a control, that is, the scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other drugs with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the US Olympic Committee and acknowledges the imperative need for the Olympic family to foster a safe environment for all athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that says the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, might be better served with significant change within our organization in the future, rather than withdrawing certification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could clarify how abuses of the dimensions so bravely described by the survivors of Larry Nassar could have gone unnoticed for so long and welcomes all necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same objective: to make gymnastics as a sport, as well as others, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.
It was during the 1960s that Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an advisor and, subsequently, for the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.

This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (a theory already widespread) and also provides other data that, in general, fossils do not offer us, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the animal's feathers were brown on the top and pale or carotenoid-colored on the bottom.
The finding also provides insight into how feathers evolved in birds.
As dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed quill, called a rachis, but do have other characteristics typical of feathers (barbs and barbules), the researchers deduced that the rachis likely represents an evolution subsequent to those other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for regulating temperature or as ornamentation. Researchers suggested that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen presents adult plumage and is not the down of a young hatchling.
The researchers suggested that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample exhibits adult plumage and is not the down of a young hatchling.

They discovered that the Sun follows the same basic principles as the rest of the stars: it was verified that the activity of all the stars in the system is governed by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a stellar Rossby number, related to plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less activity the star will have in relation to magnetic inversions.

The work carried out was fundamentally theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations made in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts attraction on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts its attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around the galaxy is located around it in a kind of halo and consists of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he stated that the new variant was "extremely concerning and alarming due to its very high mortality rate."
It is possible that some patients contracted the disease in the hospital, in the opinion of Dr. Moll, and at least two of them were healthcare workers there.
After a year, an infected person will be able to infect 10 or 15 of their immediate contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group with tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at a given time in South Africa.

In France, voting has traditionally been an experience with hardly any technological presence: voters isolate themselves in a booth and insert a pre-printed paper indicating the chosen candidate inside an envelope.
Once the officials verify the voter's identity, they place the envelope in the ballot box and sign the voter register.
The French electoral legislation codifies the procedure in a very strict way.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that no ballots are inserted at the start of the voting, and also that no envelopes are added, except for those of properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each and every part of the process. At night, the volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Huhne and Pryce are expected to appear before the Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
The deceased were Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21. Cuddeback was the driver.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider required reconstructive surgery on his face.
Uka's gun failed when she pointed it at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers constant pain, went blind in one eye, lost a section of his skull, and had to have his face reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider offered his testimony via a video link from a USAF base in his home country.
In addition to Wednesday's competition, Carpanedo participated in two other individual races in the championship.
His first was the slalom, where he received a "Did Not Finish" in his first race. 36 of the 116 competitors had the same result in that competition.
In her other competition, the giant slalom, she finished in 10th position in the women's sitting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first position of the Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the 9th position of the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four skiers in the women's sitting category group did not finish their races, and 45 out of the total 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not qualify for the competition.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The deputy inspector general, D. K. Arya, stated: "We have arrested five people who raped the woman of Swiss nationality and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused respond to the names of Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The superintendent of police Chandra Shekhar Solanki explained that the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Despite there being three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extricated the driver of the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya appeared before the Edinburgh Sheriff Court accused of murdering her son.
He is being held pending the filing of charges and trial, but any evidence from the witnesses could be altered due to the extensive publication of his image.
It is a common practice in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice works differently and according to the courts' consideration, the publication of the photos was potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee points out, "journalists seem to tread a dangerous line when publishing photos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which generally handles legal proceedings, told journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the charges are formalized.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the dispute over borders, which the Palestinians demand be based on the borders prior to the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other allegedly addressed topics include the future status of Jerusalem, which holds sacred significance for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to maintain that presence only for five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control test would be closely supervised by guards during the test supervision and the assessment of its effectiveness.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were hired as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage for NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation were given comprehensive safety guidelines and training.
Martelly inaugurated the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday, which is composed of nine people.
It is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the prior resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
Martelly responded to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October with the commission.
The occasionally violent protesters were spurred on by the inability to hold elections, some pending since 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of iPod failures due to overheating have been reported, which caused a total of six fires and resulted in minor burns to four people.
The Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan stated that they were aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The Ministry responded by describing it as "truly regrettable" that Apple delayed the report.
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The agency for emergency management of the Northern Marianas stated that no damage in the country had been reported.
In the same way, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that no tsunami notification was recorded.
A former Filipino policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
A large number of hostages have been rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were initially released, as well as photographers from the Philippines.
Subsequently, the photographers were replaced by an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Liggins began studying premature births in his spare time while working at the hospital.
His research showed that if the hormone were administered, the maturation of the fetus's lungs would accelerate.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators recovered the two flight recorders: the "black boxes".
The fighter companions also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first 'Queen of Extreme.' My first representative. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. Something extraordinary, almost like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me… maybe even more… I love her and will miss her… I hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
The acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard expressed throughout the campaign for the 2010 federal elections that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of the survey participants share the viewpoint that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal holder was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to issues with his fitness, it is uncertain.
He couldn't take the medication he needs to endure the pain since it is prohibited in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number to date.
Numerous people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, which was made known on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were the origin of the arrival of water on Earth along with organic matter that can create proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, especially how Earth was formed, since comets collided with Earth a very long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began serving as governor this year and last month signed a bill for the legalization of same-sex marriages.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
It is rumored that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of older ground-based radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to locate an aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
Extra transportation is not being offered and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley; parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the surface.
Fears about the lack of transport opened up the possibility that the game would have to be held behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden pointed out that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it is believed that this process took much longer due to the breeding between an endemic Darwin finch (Geospiza fortis) and a Espanola cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be molded into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be transformed into a fine thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can also be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be reduced to a minimum thickness and stuck to other metals. Its thickness can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures, called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. An indicator can be created using the juice of a red cabbage.
The cabbage changes color depending on the degree of acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substance.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which the electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then, with clean and damp hands, shape them into a ball.
The moisture of the hands will react with the outer layers, which will give a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had cisterns in practically every house, connected to an advanced sanitation system.
In the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remains of sewer systems were found.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets also existed. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, shared by both men and women alike.
When calling someone who is thousands of kilometers away, a satellite is being used.
The satellite in space receives the call and immediately bounces it back, almost instantaneously.
A rocket launched the satellite into space. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A gigantic rocket over 100 feet tall is necessary to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel did for us is provide us with easier and faster methods of transportation.
He gave us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below these are medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Lastly, there are many small cats (including pet cats in the wild) that eat significantly more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of its success lies in the niche idea, a specialized task that each cat is assigned, preventing them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called prides.
The herds are composed of one to three adult males that are related, along with up to thirty females and pups.
Female individuals are usually related to each other, as they belong to a large family of sisters and daughters.
The prides of lions act in a way very similar to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (though not to other big cats) in their behavior and also highly deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (although not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with a force five times greater than a strong human.
The tiger is included in the same group ("genus panthera") as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that have the ability to roar.
The roar of the tiger is not the same as the full roar of a lion, but rather a phrase with words snarled in shouts.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are quite a bit smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) using their sense of smell, sniffing where they have moved along the ground.
They can see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision and also move stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originates (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or move to a new island in such a way that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were previously in.
This new environment has different resources and different competition, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it needed to be up to that point.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it also starts to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will have such a different appearance that they can no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that we can exhale (that is, expel through breath).
The plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and also make clothes with them. Most of the food we consume is also from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaurus was the top predator of its time and feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
His long jaw was adorned with more than 70 blade-like sharp teeth, in addition to an extra set on the roof of the mouth, which meant that nothing that crossed its path had any escape.
We cannot know for certain, but it is possible that it had a bifurcated tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it is even possible that it was cannibalistic.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-rex would not be a match for it.
Although most of their foods would be familiar to us, the Romans had a bunch of strange or unusual items for feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting in chairs, rich men liked to hold banquets together where they could recline on one side while eating.
The banquets of ancient Rome could not include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor coconut and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a primary temple that was considered the home of that deity.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet their needs through ceremonies and festivals.
All temples have an open courtyard and, subsequently, an inner sanctuary that only priests can access.
Sometimes special towers in the shape of pyramids, called "ziggurats," were erected to be integrated as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, houses were not as important.
Most of the life of Hebrew families developed outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were simple open counters that faced the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the region of Canaan, there were no significant forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. The Scandinavian sagas tell that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for committing a murder and that, while traveling westward, he found a territory which he named Greenland.
Despite its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Even though all the countries were "Scandinavian," there were many distinctions among the people, the kings, the traditions, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you saw the movie National Treasure, it's likely you think a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not correct. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words: "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence, this document on a large parchment (measuring 29¾ by 24½ inches) was kept rolled up.
Thus, it is likely that this annotation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landing and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained occupied.
It was governed by "Vichy" France. These were French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of confronting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the south of France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation forces liberated the south of France and were heading towards the Germans.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a considerable group of people living and working cooperatively: a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," which means civil, related to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and which also to some extent defines the size of a society.
City-states are the ones that give rise to nations. A civilized culture means that knowledge is passed through different generations, an enduring cultural remnant, and considerable dissemination.
Minor civilizations frequently disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and do not come to be recognized as civilizations in their own right.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first created a weak central government (composed solely of Congress) under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and, with no national executive or legislative in place to enforce all its laws, it relied on state authorities, who frequently refused to cooperate.
Nor did it have the authority to invalidate fiscal legislation or tariffs between the states.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all the states before they could be amended, but the states took the government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian team, along with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Some popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports enjoy more popularity in the northern regions, while Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that compose it, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago."
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when European navigators who passed by recorded the name of the island as "ilha Formosa" or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its base in southwest Taiwan, thereby initiating the transformation of indigenous grain production practices and providing employment to Chinese workers who worked on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western coastal and northern areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared the country a province of the Qing empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they were originally like.
In 1976, 30% of the restoration of Machu Picchu had already been completed, which continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photographic image format in the world is 35 mm, which was the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more important is the aspect ratio inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format, in fact and to add to the confusion, measures 36 mm in width by 24 mm in height.
Thus, it is said that the aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve, the simplest whole number ratio is obtained) is 3:2.
Different standard formats (the APS format family, for example) are the same or very close to this aspect ratio.
The excessively overused and often ridiculous rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a semblance of order in an image.
It states that the most effective position for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For thousands of years, the Christian religion united European states despite differences in languages and customs.
His dominant power in all areas affected everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the basic principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the financial funds of the church exist specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been Rome for a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this pillar was being upheld.
Immediately after the start of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, as it cut vital civil and military supplies, although this blockade violated international law of general international acceptance codified by many international agreements in the last two decades.
Great Britain sowed the international waters with mines to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among the majority of citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horror and atrocities committed during the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to live in the United States of America, where he accepted a job with the Edison Company in the city of New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter in which Charles Batchelor (manager at his last job) recommended him to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was an exclusive method to show the different time periods; each era of China or each family that came to power was a particular dynasty.
In the same way, between each of the dynasties, an era of instability occurred with the division of the provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the time of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods of time, a bloody war occurred between different nobles who were trying to seize the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit in the highest position in the great palace of Xi'an.
It had many social and political consequences; for example, the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Similarly, after the Revolution, occupations were open to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and determined to achieve success.
The same happens with the military, because the army ranks, instead of being based on class, have come to be based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a great interest in matters related to the hereafter beyond this worldly life. He frequently went to a cave that came to be known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
That same cave, which has survived the passage of time, provides an intense image of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Situated on one of the mountains of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to discover at all if one knew it existed. Inside the cave, the isolation is total.
Nothing more than the beautiful clear sky above the numerous mountains around can be seen. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures that were built in honor of the death of the pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt contains many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, while a large number of other smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
The "arch up" mark resembles a V and the "arch down" mark looks like a bracket or a square missing the bottom half.
"Up" means starting at the tip and pushing the bow, while "down" means starting at the heel (where the hand holds the bow) and pulling the bow.
The upward movement of the bow usually produces a softer sound, while the downward movement is more intense and assertive.
You can write your own notations, but don't forget that the printed bow markings are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), as well as the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and hurled threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At a given moment, a member of the mob waved the head of a royal guard murdered at Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were obliged to pay taxes to the US colonial regime in order to cover most of the expenses and the interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Filipino government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the extraordinary profits resulting from the long exploitation of the Filipino people would be the basic achievements of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period in European history that comprises the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (A.D. from 1000 to 1300).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by general convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
A large part of the interpretations of technological determinism share two main ideas: that the development of technology in itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that motor cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a multitude of cars, so new production methods are designed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of vehicles also results in a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare to repair injured bodies.
The romanticism contained an important element of cultural determinism, derived from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to that geographical context emerged, which, being in harmony with the place of that society, proved to be better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a cradle of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century, mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned bringing gifts, such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was during this time that the title of fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its height in the period between the 10th or 11th century and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, as a result of the slowness of communication channels, Western styles could be delayed by between 25 and 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to create its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is carried out to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, usually organic system that uses native seeds saved from that ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, farmers worked in subsistence agriculture and it is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive by the age, ethnic origin, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine the differences of a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of all these factors.
Members of a subculture often make their association evident through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behavior, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to make use of the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate mistreatment, were not socialized by adults as they were growing up.
These children are called "wild" or feral. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of these children is due to the parents' rejection of their severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the wild children experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others were allegedly raised by animals; some are said to have lived solitary, away from civilization.
When raised by non-human animals, wild children exhibit behaviors (within their physical limits) almost completely identical to that of the particular animal that cared for them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the method takes it one step further.
The scaffold is not a learning method, but a support that provides assistance to individuals undertaking a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The states can be both virtual and real, that is, the teacher is one form of state, but so is the little man-shaped clip in Microsoft Office.
The virtual assessments are embedded in the software and their purpose is to question, provoke, and explain procedures that might be difficult for the student to tackle alone.
The minors are taken into care for a wide range of different reasons, which can range from abandonment and abuse to blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not enriching, affectionate, and educational, but it happens.
We perceive the foster care system without adoption as a safety zone for those young people.
It is taken for granted that our foster care system without adoption provides safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
Adoption in a foster mode is supposed to provide all the needs that are lacking in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The particular characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions regarding the approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The "personal involvement" and the "continued relationships" were also identified as new motivating aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated the public's reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to fundamental discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting just milliseconds.
In particular, it is asserted that it is possible to detect when a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how people who lack the ability to understand speech due to brain damage are nonetheless able to accurately determine sincerity.
It even suggests that these abilities to interpret human behavior might be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research conducted in the 20th century demonstrated that there are two reserves of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes it from the set of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix the variations above and below between both reservoirs in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet their amino acid requirements from the existing plants.
Moreover, not doing so has serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large amount of proteins that include all essential amino acids.
Taking everything into account, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a relatively similar way to chimpanzees on the savannah today.
The interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally waking up during the normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly after (between 10 and 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that helps return to consciousness without waking up completely.
If you find yourself hitting the snooze button on the alarm without waking up, you can place it on the other side of the room to force yourself to get up and turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms involve drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to bed, forcing you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The less the tension, the more positive the life force present will be. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve a state of enlightenment. The only obstacle standing between us and this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but these were extended through the Mahayana path of love, as well as through many Indian yoga techniques.
To begin with, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path to all-encompassing love.
Through Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (illuminating energy) awakens through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are reactivated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the clashes between systems, processes, and culture led to disagreement between the countries.
After two years since the end of the war, the former allies have now become enemies and the Cold War has begun.
It would extend over the next forty years and was actually fought, through proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and other different places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.
Nevertheless, those plans became obsolete overnight when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Non-Aggression Pact between Russia and Poland, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for the transportation of goods is, by far, the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and cargo across the ocean.
The function of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that the country maintains the ability to transport people and goods while interfering with the enemy's ability to move theirs.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using U-boats, tried to stop that traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Great Britain in the same way it had done in the rest of Europe.
It is believed that goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them to gain easy access to milk, fur, meat, and leather.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, in a manner similar to the more commonly known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
The "waggonways" (carts on rails pulled by horses) were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagonways consisted simply of parallel wooden boards, this allowed horses to pull them to achieve higher speeds and move heavier loads along the slightly more rudimentary roads of the time.
The sleepers were introduced very early to secure the tracks in position. However, gradually, it became evident that the tracks would be much more efficient if they had a piece of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused stronger wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels replaced the iron ones. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known method of transportation was walking; humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means "upright man").
Its predecessor, the australopithecus, did not walk upright as is usual.
The bipedal specialization is found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus was already walking on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally respectful way, we can join an environmental defense movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, it amounts to a treatment of the symptoms. However, if we do not want a solution that is purely temporary, we should look for the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is more than evident that the world has changed considerably as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have increased due to overpopulation and the excessive lifestyle of human beings.
After the Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the president of the Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a couple of streets away to the printing office of John Dunlap.
That same night, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. Another additional copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 known Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of that document. The original handwritten document did not survive.
Different paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. They are called birds.
Many people do not consider them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
These birds exhibit many characteristics still very similar to those of dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs just like T-rex.
Almost all the computers used today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, that is, 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
It is possible that internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so generic that it is impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medications or toxic household substances.
Check the label for the specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term has its origin in the classic familiarity with bedbugs, insects with a great ability to adapt to parasitize humans.
Both reduviids and bedbugs are nesters, adapted to live in their own nest or that of their host.
Across the entire United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the neurological disease with the highest incidence among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research found that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
A couple can decide that raising a child is neither in their interest nor in the child's interest.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the natural parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to determine how the world works through scientific methods. This method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
It is not solely through experimentation, but the experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, by asking questions and making observations that guide scientific research.
The naturalists and the philosophers focused on the classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
The opinion of Aristotle was accepted in all matters relating to science, including psychology.
As Greek wisdom declined, the West detached itself from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often have a vital dependence on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
There are documented periodic rhythms, which are just responses to external periodic patterns, in the majority of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a free-running period even in the absence of external cues.
The experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase was one of the leading factors suggesting that DNA constitutes genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have multiple different effects depending on their type, the relevance of the affected element of the genetic material, and whether the influenced cells are of the germline.
Only mutations in germline cells are likely to be passed on to children, while mutations in other areas can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-focused tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, as well as the wildlife and flora.
Examples of "in situ" activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, in addition to studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, visit, photograph, and learn about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns by car to head to their workplace, crossing paths with others whose work destination is the same place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transport service, everyone is somehow connected and supports the private vehicle-based transport system.
Current science shows that this massive coal-dependent economy has changed the biosphere from one of its stable states that sustained human evolution over the last two million years.
We all participate in society and use means of transportation. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, one rarely hears a similar level of complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints? Why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there some more fundamental problem?
The flow of traffic is the study of the movement of drivers and private vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within reasonably consistent margins; therefore, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and an approximate mathematical representation can be made.
To achieve a better representation of traffic flow, relationships were established between its three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan and design the operations of traffic services.
The insects were the first to fly. Their ability to fly helped them escape from enemies more easily and find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings against their body.
This offers them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite; the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems logical, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and most voluminous river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a width of six miles.
A total of 20% of the river water on the planet that flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon has a length of 6,387 km (3980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite the fact that stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, those of Giza were never surpassed in either size or technical superiority of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were already more than a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest number of inhabitants.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
The Italian is also the everyday language used by most of the people who work in the state, while Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humanity has known basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized about the principle that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but the theory was also proposed that they transform into new substances that shape what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more materials. It should not be forgotten that the periodic table includes many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a good friend to many people at the time of its invention.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to an inferior status and uses.
Now people write messages on computer screens without ever having to approach a pencil sharpener.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something new replaces it.
The fission bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to bind a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to dragging a heavy cart uphill. By dividing the nucleus again, it then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, that is, they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of approximately 70 km in the closest area and 100 km in the farthest area.
It is thinner under the oceanic areas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there is more mare on the nearer side because the crust is thinner. Lava found it easier to rise to the surface.
The theories about content focus on finding out what motivates people or what they find appealing.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalized as they matured and became adults.
These theories study what makes certain people want certain things and what things in their environment will lead them to perform or not perform certain actions.
Two popular theories about content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general terms, two types of behaviors can occur when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On one end, they will try to continue being "one more colleague."
This type of manager has the difficulty of making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and demanding accountability from people.
On the other side of the coin, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who believes they must change everything the team has done and adopt it as their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often creates divisions between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams respond to the same levels of excellence as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
The members of virtual teams often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They tend to have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as their teams may meet depending on different time zones, which the national management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) also constitutes a unique component of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the management group to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the slow process of establishing an organization that fosters learning? One of the objectives of putting into practice the learning concepts of an organization is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can transpire.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new process of innovation that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, in addition to sharing knowledge and learning as an organization.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach in cognition research. Thus, they reduce the area of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the scientists' research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The expansion of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before seen.
This provides a great amount of information and material that allows us to build simulation models to help us understand the process in our mind.
Although AI has strong nuances of science fiction, it constitutes an important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The research in artificial intelligence seeks to make machines automate activities that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to patient diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
This type of thing has transformed into independent disciplines, which try to provide solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, as it has been integrated into multiple home software applications and video games.
Excursions are a very important part of any classroom. Often teachers would love to take their students to places where traveling by bus is not feasible.
Technology offers the solution through virtual school visits. Students can see the displays of the museums, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while seated at their desks.
Sharing a school trip virtually can also be a great way to reflect on the trip and experiences shared with other classrooms in the future.
For example, every year the students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their field trip to the state capital; every year the website is redesigned, but previous versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often start their blogging experiences by showing poor command of grammar and spelling, generally, the presence of an audience prompts them to change.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to make an effort to improve their writing and avoid criticism.
Furthermore, maintaining a blog "forces students to learn more about the world around them." The need to feed the public's interests inspires students to showcase their intelligence and be interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that promotes collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
A proper use of blogs "allows students to be empowered to have a more analytical and critical mindset; by providing an active response to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of what is written by others, in addition to defining their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada that boasts a selection of art galleries and museums where one can contemplate the past and present of the country.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and many more make Ontario an example of what foreigners consider intrinsically Canadian.
Large areas towards the north are scarcely populated, and many are practically uninhabited wildlands.
Here is a comparison about populations that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and a continent of its own in terms of flora and fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are famous for being luxury beach vacation destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, which took deep root in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Women traveling here are advised to claim they are married, regardless of their marital status.
It can also be useful to wear a wedding ring (that doesn't look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences could lead to something they would consider harassment and it is common for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Show firmness in rejecting men and do not be afraid to assert your position (whether due to cultural differences or not, it is unacceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sailors in the 10th century BC and used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as the White House, only to finally abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city with the name Daru l-Badya, and the Spanish merchants, who established trading posts there, named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
In the outskirts of the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of trinkets, but all of this is aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and most of the city's streets, particularly in the center, were buried.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside the city should be investigated to know the status of the confrontation that still persists in the province of North Kivu.
Similarly, the city is the base from which one can ascend to the Nyiragongo Volcano, in addition to some of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa.
To get around Goma, one can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The normal (local) price is approximately 500 Congolese francs for that short trip.
Together with its relative inaccessibility, the term Timbuktu in English has become a metaphor for exotic and distant places.
Currently, Timbuktu is a very poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it also has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special on the Wonders of the African World.
The city offers a stark contrast with the rest of the country, due to its more Arab than African atmosphere.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northwest of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each maintaining different fauna and flora.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African national parks (SANParks).
Just like in other South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and park entry fees.
It is likely that it will also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which offers access either to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa’s National Parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the entire territory and is the place that many tourists consider most relevant.
The parade of buildings that define the skyline in Hong Kong has been compared to a bright bar chart made visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbor.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, you will need to leave the island and head to the Kowloon pier on the opposite shore.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land on the north coast.
The British colonizers adopted this place as their own, so if you are looking for traces of the colonial history of the territory, this is a good starting point.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove strip on the planet, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland into Bangladesh and India from the coast.
Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that is located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not simple mangrove swamps: they include some of the last refuges of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², of which approximately one third is covered by water and marshes.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for wildlife and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 chitals in that area.
The buses leave the inter-district bus station (across the river) continuously throughout the day, but most of them, particularly those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As the buses between districts tend to be full, it is recommended to buy the ticket in advance.
Most districts have a service of small Japanese Coaster buses, comfortable and solid vehicles.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient method to travel to nearby places, like Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Both towers reach a height of 83 meters, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two 3.50 m wide lanes.
The clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs controls are anticipated to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group that inhabited what is now known as eastern Paraguay; they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "the giant province of the Indies," was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous native groups.
The period of colonization initiated by the Spanish lasted for three centuries.
From the moment of the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay largely managed to maintain its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year is held in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Here you can also witness smaller-scale tournaments and matches during other times of the year.
To obtain information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, you can consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), whose value is fixed at parity with the British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is generally accepted on all the islands, and in Stanley itself, credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
In the peripheral islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, although British and American currency will be accepted; it is advisable to consult with the owners in advance to determine the most acceptable method of payment.
It is practically impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so it is advisable to make the exchange before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30 °C are common.
Winter can be disappointingly cool: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to create a sensation of being colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year.
Despite the fact that many of the animals in the park are accustomed to the presence of humans, they are still wild animals that should not be fed or disturbed.
The park management recommends staying at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters from other wild animals.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, elk, bears, and practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries from not maintaining an appropriate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so they should be given space.
Additionally, it must be taken into account that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so it is necessary to avoid bringing or cooking foods that have strong smells and to keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the place where the infamous naval confrontation occurred in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave it.
All the ships sank, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the fight for independence driven by the Mau movement, a peaceful demonstration in the city resulted in the assassination of the high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to the fact that Auckland is situated between two harbors, it has many beaches. The most popular ones are spread across three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are all sandy beaches safe for swimming and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the elegant residential neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They tend to be very popular family beaches with a good variety of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The most famous local beer is "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is called "Manta".
There are many types of French wine to choose from, but probably the New Zealand and Australian ones withstand travel better.
Local tap water can be safely drunk, but bottled water is easy to find if in doubt.
For Australians, the idea of a coffee "with milk" is foreign. A black coffee is an "espresso," the cappuccino has a layer of whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The chocolate cup meets Belgian expectations. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Throughout the year, many trips to the reef are organized, and injuries caused by these reasons on the reefs are uncommon.
However, the advice of the authorities should be followed, the indications of the signs should be complied with, and special attention should be paid to the safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside this period.
Sharks exist; however, they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is found in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance offers peace of mind to the traveler by knowing that they will have a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although it may also be possible to book other types of accommodations, such as campgrounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to or from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
The reservation can also be held if more time is needed to evaluate the offer or to seek other documents for the destination (for example, visas).
However, any modification or request should be processed initially through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, most attendees decide to camp within the festival itself, and most of them consider it a fundamental part of the experience.
To be closer to the action, it will be necessary to arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
It should not be forgotten that although the music has ended on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play music well into the early hours.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
In case of crossing the northern Baltic during winter, the location of the cabin should be checked, as the journey through the ice produces an extremely unpleasant noise that affects some people more.
The Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from requiring a visa (see conditions).
Typically, casinos go to great lengths to maximize the time and money guests spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and encourage them to stay on the premises.
In some places, free alcoholic drinks are offered. However, drunkenness clouds judgment, and all good players are aware of the importance of staying sober.
People who are going to drive at high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or below-freezing temperatures.
On icy or snowy roads, friction is low, so you cannot drive in the same way as you would on normal asphalt.
During a squall in a very short period of time, enough snow can fall to get trapped.
Visibility may also be reduced by snowfalls or sleet or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic continues almost without interruptions throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest attraction for tourism in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari is popularly used to refer to overland trips to see the impressive African wildlife, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, come very close to the cars, so a standard team will allow for a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes appear shy, so the best way to see them is with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") consists of hiking for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some of the events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked the flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, the situation may become complicated.
The cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most cancellations due to coronavirus will not go beyond July 2020, the scheduled date for the Olympics.
The majority of tickets for the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with the average ticket price being around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for use, even if they are not found in the room itself.
If an iron is not available or you don't feel like ironing the socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if there is one.
Do not let the material sit for too long (this can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, to burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some of them more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others it needs to be done for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, so if in doubt, you should consider buying bottled water from an accredited company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their regions of origin.
Pests can spoil food, cause nuisances or, in the worst cases, provoke allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals capable of injuring or killing people using force are generally not considered pests.
Shopping at Duty Free is an opportunity to purchase items free of taxes and consumption duties in certain places.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often passes through isolated terrains in the middle of nowhere.
If you're not used to driving on secondary roads, stay calm: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp bends are predominant.
The indicated speed limits are considerably lower than those in previous and subsequent sections (usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)) and strict compliance is even more important than otherwise.
Nonetheless, it is curious that the mobile phone service has more coverage here than in other sections of the route, for example, in Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German pastries are quite good and, in Bavaria, they are quite sweet and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbors: Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples cooked in confections throughout the year, and cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many German pastry products also include almonds, hazelnuts, and other types of nuts. Popular cookies usually pair perfectly with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to try some hard and consistent pastries, try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, combined with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used for cooking curry; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is generally used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that encompasses a wide variety of dishes found throughout the country.
However, when used without any other qualifier, the term usually means the typical food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Currently easily available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a range of simply seasoned dishes, with the predominant flavors favored by the Javanese being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on each side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability for the rider, but they can pose safety issues due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting trapped in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged by the horse if it runs away. To minimize this risk, there are a number of safety precautions that can be taken.
First of all, most motorcyclists wear boots with heels and a smooth, quite narrow sole.
Afterwards, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to fall from the saddle when pulled backwards in the event of the rider's fall.
The Cochamó Valley, the main climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and boulders.
The summits have impressive views of the peaks. Climbers from all over the world continually establish new routes among their walls of infinite potential.
Alpine snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular and involve sliding downhill on snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard on your feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity, with many enthusiasts, occasionally called "ski fanatics," who plan entire vacations around skiing at a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
The sport of alpine skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Touring skiing: This activity is also called ski touring, ski mountaineering, or ski hiking.
It is related, although it does not usually involve alpine ski tourism or mountaineering, since the latter is done on sloped terrain and requires much harder skis and boots.
The ski route should be thought of as similar to a hiking one.
In good conditions, it will be possible to cover distances a little longer than on foot, but the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks will only occasionally be reached.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean having to apply for different visas and go through multiple passport controls.
However, the Schengen area in that sense works to some extent as a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the border without having to go through passport control points again.
In the same way, having a Schengen visa eliminates the need to apply for visas for each member country of the Schengen agreement separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that determines which manufactured objects are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than it would be in Europe.
Craft products could be defined as antiques, although they are more recent than similar items produced on a large scale.
The reindeer herding is an important means of sustenance among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding its trade is also important for many other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived by fishing, hunting, and similar activities, primarily keeping reindeer as draft animals.
Currently, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism constitutes an important income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although its use is widespread, especially among non-Romani, the word "Gypsy" is often considered insulting due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of that people.
If travel safety recommendations are issued for the country you are going to, your health or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
Perhaps you want to consult the advice of governments other than that of your own country, but their advice is directed at their citizens.
For example, it is possible that U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than those that Europeans or Arabs might experience.
The alerts are a simple brief summary of a country's political situation.
The views presented are generally superficial, general, and excessively simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather conditions is a generic term for any type of dangerous atmospheric phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption, or loss of human lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types, which will depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
The gusts of wind, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of extreme weather conditions, just like thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Some severe regional and seasonal weather phenomena include hailstorms, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to inquire about any severe adverse weather conditions that might affect their area, as this could influence their travel plans.
Anyone considering visiting a country potentially regarded as a conflict zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search for a "Hostile Environment Course" will probably find the address of a local company.
A course will usually cover all the topics we talked about here in greater detail, generally with practical activities.
A course will normally last between 2 and 5 days and will include role-playing games, many first aid exercises, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wilderness are common, but publications that discuss war zones are less so.
Travelers who plan to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for traveling back.
The willingness of governments when issuing passports without indicating the sex (X) or updated documents to correspond with a desired name and sex varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to comply with these documents also varies considerably.
The pat-downs at security controls also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not undergone surgery will not be required to go through scanners to preserve their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the flow that returns from the waves after breaking against the beach, usually against a reef or similar.
Due to the topology of the groundwater, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and it is possible that a fast current forms towards the deep waters from that point.
Most deaths occur due to the fatigue of trying to swim back against the current, which may prove impossible.
As soon as one gets out of the current, swimming again is no more difficult than usual.
It should be attempted again in an area where there is no possibility of getting trapped or, depending on swimming ability and whether it has already been spotted, wait to be rescued.
The shock of returning occurs before the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their culture of origin.
Upon returning home after living abroad, one has already adapted to the new culture and lost some of one's own habits.
When he traveled abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
It is possible that people anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary with travelers returning home.
The light and sound show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for the kids.
The pyramids can be observed in the darkness and contemplated in silence before the show begins.
Usually, the noise of tourists and vendors is always heard. The history of sound and light is like a story.
The sphinx appears as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids, which are all illuminated.
Many countries claim the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819. These host the largest number of bases, with sixteen of them active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the water-filled caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula that borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge here with the plain and then reemerge to form the 360 km long range of the Ellsworth Mountains, crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The north part of the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, where Mount Vinson in the Vinson Range reaches 4892 m.
In remote locations, without mobile phone coverage, it is likely that a satellite phone will be the only possible option.
Satellite phones are generally not a substitute for mobile phones, as it is necessary to be outside with a direct line to the satellite in order to make a call.
This service is frequently used to make shipments, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that require remote data and voice.
The local telephone service provider should be able to offer more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those who plan to enjoy a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among those who finish school, as they can take a gap year before entering university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can actually improve the chances of accessing higher education in the home country.
Generally, a registration fee is applied to enroll in those educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, it is not necessary to have a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are undoubtedly large enough for any type of yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak allow for a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
The same happens in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it is still quite exceptional (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one in every forty).
Most Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg (Russia).
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days and return to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only plan to go ashore with the onboard excursions, you will not need an additional visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin (Germany) in their brochures. As shown in the previous map, Berlin is far from the sea and city visits are not included in the cost of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and dislikes of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how the plane works and what happens during a flight could help them overcome the fear that is based on the unknown or on not having control.
Courier companies receive good payment for delivering items quickly. Often, time is very important when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and for smaller companies, this posed a problem.
If things were sent by airmail, it was possible that on certain routes it would take several days to unload and go through customs.
The only way to get it to arrive earlier was by sending it as checked baggage. But airline regulations prohibit sending luggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
An obvious way to fly in first class or business class is by shelling out a lot of money for the privilege (or, better yet, getting the company itself to pay).
However, it is not cheap: as a rough rule, one could end up paying four times the price of a regular business ticket and up to eleven times for a first-class one!
In general, it's not worth looking for discounts on business class or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know perfectly well that there is an exclusive group of passengers who are willing to pay exorbitant prices for the privilege of reaching their destination quickly and comfortably, with the corresponding charge.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, although Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered due to ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in the west of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but no UN member country recognizes it.
Economic ties have been reestablished between those two parts of Moldova despite the failed political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second most important port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
In the ancient city of Smyrna, there is now a modern, extensive, and bustling shopping center, framed by the outline of a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers mingle with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, despite the city having an atmosphere more akin to Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusually designed octagonal church.
In the cemetery, interesting marble sculptures of doves can be observed on the tombstones.
It is worth taking a half-hour walk around such an intriguing village.
To the north and easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which was popularized among foreigners after Lord Byron's laudatory description of its wonders.
The Scotturb 403 bus travels regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, one must visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima (sepulcher), a center of worship worldwide famous for the apparitions of the Virgin.
Remember that you are basically visiting a mass grave, as well as a place that holds immeasurable significance for a huge proportion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women living who survived their time there and many more whose loved ones were killed or worked to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
This place must be treated with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. It is forbidden to make jokes about the Holocaust and the Nazis.
It is forbidden to damage the environment with marks or scratches painted on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, which most people understand, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are written exclusively in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other services.
Normal metro announcements are made solely in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are announced via an automated system in a wide range of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Although it is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is still by maintaining good behavior and acting like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make getting around the city considerably easier.
The abrupt exterior of Parisians will quickly evaporate if basic courtesy manners are demonstrated.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park has a dense forest mass, primarily of beeches, different types of spruces, such as firs and false firs, and a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a considerably wide variety of plant communities, due to its extensive range of microclimates, different soils, and variety of altitudes.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animals and bird species.
Here you can find exotic wildlife such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wildcats, and capercaillies, in addition to many other common species.
In visits to the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that reach the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer scarves for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, particularly one with bright colors, you will be greeted with a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
In the same way, men must wear pants that cover them to the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the pile at the entrance, but that clothing is not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing those skirts. One size fits all men!
The gastronomy of Mallorca, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (particularly pork) and uses olive oil for everything.
A simple popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available topping, for example, cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, with the word Sie which means you, are always written in uppercase, even in the middle of a sentence.
It constitutes a significant way to differentiate between some verbs and objects.
In theory, it facilitates reading, although writing is somewhat complicated due to the need to decide whether a verb or an adjective is used as a noun.
The pronunciation of Italian is quite easy since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters that need attention are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
You must also ensure to differentiate the pronunciation of r and rr: caro means dear, while carro means animal-drawn vehicle.
The Persian language has a considerably simple and quite regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar could help to learn a lot about Persian and understand the sentences better.
It goes without saying that, if one already speaks a Romance language, it will be easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know some Spanish might jump to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is similar enough to not have to study it separately.
Premodern observatories are generally obsolete today and are preserved as museums or educational centers.
Since at its peak light pollution did not pose the problem it does today, they are usually found in cities or campuses, which were much easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes consist of giant installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Contemplating the flowering of the cherry trees, known as "hanami", has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the favored flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were celebrated by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants are more beautiful when they are in their natural environment, so you should resist the temptation to pick even "just one" specimen.
When visiting a garden with a formal design, collecting "samples" will result in immediate expulsion, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit where it is very easy to get around; you can also buy practically anything once there.
However, being located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the Equator, you will have to adapt to both the (constant) heat and the intense sun (when the sky is clear, which is less common).
There are also some buses that head north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are planning to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
River networks can be a good theme on which to base a holiday.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhin Valley, or take a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube, or take a boat ride on the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking or cycling tours.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals in Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding this celebration have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night in vigil in an open place to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is likely that it is a pre-Christian ritual to exalt spring and fertility.
Traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, after which congregations usually break out into a celebration at the start of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals could not make the journey, so the giant tortoise became the first grazing animal in the Galápagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galápagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience the polar night, meaning when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This presents an excellent opportunity to see the northern lights, since the sky will be dark practically 24 hours a day.
As those areas are scarcely populated and light pollution, consequently, does not tend to be a problem, one can enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and coworkers address each other by their last name or job title.
Enjoying harmony in the workplace is essential, emphasizing the group's effort instead of praising individual achievements.
Workers often must obtain approval from their superiors for any decisions they make and are expected to follow their instructions without objection.
