This not only proves a widely spread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that most fossils cannot offer, such as color and three-dimensional composition.
Scientists say the outer layer of this animal's feathers is chestnut brown, while the inner layer is a whitish color or carrot color.
The discovery also provides deeper insights into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked well-developed shafts, known as rachises, other feather characteristics indeed existed, namely barbs and barbules. Therefore, researchers infer that these other characteristics likely later evolved into rachises.
The structure of these feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation or display. Researchers say that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows it has mature feathers, not juvenile down.
Researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the feathers in the sample are fully developed, rather than being newborn fuzz of a young animal.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, resulting in the deaths of two police officers and injuring over twenty civilians.
The governor's office stated that among the injured, nineteen are police officers.
The police said they suspect that the attack was carried out by militants possibly affiliated with Daesh (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant).
They discovered that the functioning of the Sun follows the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their luminosity and rotation, it is as simple as that.
The Rossby number of a star is related to the flow of plasma and must be determined by luminosity and rotation.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the celestial body is in terms of magnetic field reversal.

The current research is primarily theoretical, but the purpose of this project is to simulate the observations made on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team wants to observe is the result of the tidal interactions between the dark matter of this galaxy and the Milky Way.
Just as the moon's gravity causes tides on Earth, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
Scientists can ascertain that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
The theory claims that most of the dark matter around a galaxy forms a halo and is composed of many particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters, alone in the polling booth, place a pre-printed ballot specifying the voting target into an envelope.
After the voter’s identity is confirmed by an official, the voter then places the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting slip.
The voting procedures are meticulously compiled in French election law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent to allow voters and observers to witness that there are no envelopes in the box at the start of voting, and that no additional envelopes are added except those deposited by authorized and duly counted voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes following specific procedures under strict supervision.

When Uka aimed at the head of the fifth person, the gun malfunctioned. Snyder's injuries caused permanent pain, blindness in one eye, cranial defects, and his face had to be reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via video at a U.S. Air Force base in his hometown.
Apart from the match on Wednesday, Carpanedo also participated in two individual events in the championship.
Her first race was the slalom, and she did not finish the first run. Out of the 116 competitors in the event, 36 achieved the same result.
Her other competition was the giant slalom, where she placed 10th in the women's sitting ski category with a combined time of 4 minutes 41.30 seconds, 2 minutes 11.60 seconds behind the Austrian competitor Claudia Loesch, who came in first, and 1 minute 09.02 seconds behind the Hungarian competitor Gyöngyi Dani, who placed ninth.
In the women's seated team, four skiers did not finish the competition; among the 117 skiers in the giant slalom event, 45 did not receive a ranking in the competition.
The Madhya Pradesh police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Assistant Superintendent D K Arya said, "We have arrested five suspects who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants' names are Baba Konggar, Busha Konggar, Lanploe Konggar, Jaza Konggar, and Vishnu Konggar.
Officer Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants appeared in court masked.
Although there were three people inside the house when the vehicle crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver's head was severely injured.
The section of the road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed as emergency rescuers extricated the driver from the red Audi TT.
In the beginning, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was then charged with the murder of her son at the Edinburgh County Court.
She is currently in custody awaiting charges and trial, but since her image has been widely circulated, any witness testimony might be tainted.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the operation of the Scottish judiciary is different, and the court believes that releasing photos could cause potential bias.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee pointed out: "If photos and other information about suspects are published, journalists indeed seem to be walking on treacherous ground."
The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, responsible for overall prosecution matters, told reporters that no further comments will be made at least before the prosecution.
According to the leaked document, it will mention that Palestine hopes to base this border dispute on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East war.
The other topics reportedly included in the document involve the future direction of the two nations' shared holy city of Jerusalem, as well as the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands that if an agreement is signed, it will continue to station troops in the Jordan Valley for ten years, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to keep the troops for only five years.
Hunters participating in the pest control reinforcement trial will be closely monitored by national park managers, as relevant authorities need to monitor and evaluate the performance of this trial.
The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) collaborated with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) to recruit qualified volunteers under the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of the Park Conservation and Heritage Unit of the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four shooters selected to participate in the first shoot have received comprehensive safety and training briefings.
Yesterday, Ma Deli took the oath in the temporary electoral commission (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is the fifth interim election committee for Ma Decui in four years.
As part of a set of measures to propel the country towards new elections, the presidential commission recommended last month that the former interim election commission resign.
The committee was established by Ma Deli in response to the large-scale anti-regime protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the inability to hold elections, some of which were supposed to take place as early as 2011.
There are reportedly about 60 cases of iPod overheating, resulting in a total of 6 fires and causing minor burns to 4 people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan stated that it is aware of 27 incidents related to the device.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 overheating incidents to them, which the company claimed were "not serious."
The government department responded that Apple's delay in reporting is "regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office stated that no domestic damage reports have been received.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman hijacked a bus of Hong Kong tourists and took them hostage in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed.
They first released six hostages, including children and the elderly, just like the Filipino photographer.
Later, the two photographers exchanged with an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. In the end, Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical field.
He trained to become an obstetrician and began practicing at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
When Liggins was working at the hospital, he would use his time after work to study the phenomenon of premature birth.
His research shows that administering a certain hormone will accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators retrieved two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Wrestlers also pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Drummond once said, "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night with two moons, very special, just like herself. A strong woman."
Famous wrestler "Goldust" Dustin Runnels commented: "Luna was as weird as I am... maybe even weirder... I love her, and I will miss her... I hope she has gone to a better place."
Of the 1400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
In the poll, 34% of people agreed with this view, hoping that Queen Elizabeth II would be Australia's last monarch.
Among the two extreme results of the survey, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was originally scheduled to compete in the Commonwealth Games' 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle events, as well as three swimming relays, but his symptoms have raised concerns about his physical condition.
He cannot take medication to relieve the pain because those drugs are banned by the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
By early February, several people had confirmed this discovery using different hardware and software, so it was officially announced on Tuesday.
Water on Earth may have been brought by comets, and the organic matter in the water can form proteins and supply the necessities for life.
Scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, especially Earth, as comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
53-year-old Gumo took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called these rumors "political gossip and ignorance."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system claimed by the United States Federal Aviation Administration that can shorten flight paths, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and significantly reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as well as old ground radar-based technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate planes more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No other transportation options are provided, the overground will not stop at Wembley, and there is no available parking or park-and-ride arrangements on site.
Due to concerns about inconvenient transportation, the game may have to start in a situation where supporters from each team are unable to attend and cheer.
A study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" reported that a new bird species is forming in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Despite the past belief that the evolutionary process of new species took longer, researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Switzerland have discovered that this new species evolved within just two generations. It is a hybrid of the locally endemic Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortis) and the introduced cactus finch (Geospiza fortis).
Gold can be shaped into various forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
Gold can be drawn into fine wires, then wound and woven. It can also be hammered or rolled into thin sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued onto other metals. Because it can be made very thin, it is sometimes used in a type of book called "illuminated manuscript" to decorate the hand-drawn illustrations within.
This is called the pH in chemistry. You can use red cabbage juice as an indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color based on the acidity or alkalinity of chemicals.
The pH (potential of Hydrogen) is determined by the hydrogen ion concentration in a chemical substance (the H in pH stands for hydrogen).
A hydrogen ion is a proton after losing an electron (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix these two powders together, then use clean, wet hands to squeeze them into a ball shape.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layer, creating an unusual texture and forming a kind of shell.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flushing toilet, connected to an elaborate sewage system.
In the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, people have discovered remnants of sewage systems beneath the houses.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together.
When calling a friend far away, it is accomplished through a satellite.
The artificial satellite in space receives the signal and instantly reflects it back to Earth.
Artificial satellites are sent into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere can sometimes distort our light and line of sight.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to launch satellites or telescopes into space.
The wheel changed the world in astonishing ways. The greatest contribution of the wheel to humanity is that it provided us with simpler and faster means of transportation.
It has brought us trains, automobiles, and other means of transportation.
Positioned below them are the more diverse medium-sized cats, which primarily feed on medium-sized prey such as rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
In the end, many small cats (occasionally house cats) also prey on a large number of small animals, including insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to success lies in the niche concept, meaning every cat's job is unique, so they don't compete with each other.
Lions are the most social of the cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three adult male lions, along with up to thirty female lions and cubs.
Lionesses are usually close relatives to each other, being sisters and daughters within the same extended family.
The behavior of a pride of lions is very similar to that of a pack of wolves or dogs, which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large cats), and are also very ruthless toward their prey.
A tiger is an all-around athlete, capable of climbing (though not very specialized), swimming, long-distance jumping, and possessing more than five times the pulling power of a strong human.
Tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars belong to the same group (genus Panthera). Only these four cats have the ability to roar.
The roar of a tiger is not entirely a vocal roar like that of a lion, but more like a chaotic, shout-like phrase.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals; they hunt monkeys, snakes, and rodents, and will also hunt birds if possible. Most of the ocelot's prey is much smaller than its size.
Scientists believe that the jaguar relies on its sense of smell to track and locate prey, using sniffing to identify areas where prey frequents.
They have good night vision at night and can move silently. The hunting method of the tiger cat is to blend in with the surroundings and then pounce on its prey.
When a small group of creatures (a small population) becomes separated from their main population (for example, by crossing mountains or rivers, or migrating to a new island, making it difficult to return easily), they often find themselves in an environment different from before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or changes to possess stronger competitiveness than in the past.
The original population has not changed at all, so the same adaptation functions as before are still needed.
As time goes by, the new generation begins to adapt to the new environment, and their appearance becomes increasingly different from others.
Ultimately, after thousands or even millions of years, these two groups will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which indicates the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome of the evolutionary process and is also a crucial component.
Plants produce the oxygen humans breathe in and absorb the carbon dioxide humans exhale.
Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis. At the same time, they can also provide shade.
We use plants to build houses and make clothes, and most of the food we eat is also from plants; without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurs were the apex predators of that era, so apart from other mosasaurs, they feared no creature.
Its long lower jaw is lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with another set of teeth in the upper jaw, which means that any creature in its sight cannot escape.
Although it's not certain, we believe it may have a bifurcated tongue. It would eat turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and might even eat its own kind.
It will attack anything that enters the water; even a giant dinosaur like the Tyrannosaurus rex is no match for it.
Although most Roman food is familiar to us, they did consume some strange or rare foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called dormice.
Another difference is that while poor people and women sit on chairs to eat their food, wealthy men like to participate in banquets together and enjoy their feast while reclining.
The cuisine of ancient Rome did not include foods introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and the ancient Romans also never ate turkey.
The Babylonians built a major temple for each god, and those temples were regarded as the houses of the gods.
People prepare offerings for the gods, and the priests strive to meet the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple has a spacious temple courtyard, followed by an inner sanctuary that only priests can enter.
Some temples have pyramid-shaped special towers built within them, called pagoda temples.
The top of the tower is a special sanctuary of the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses become less important.
Most moments in Jewish family life are spent outdoors.
The women would cook in the courtyard; the shop was nothing more than a counter facing the street. People of that time would build houses with stones.
There are no large forests on the land of Canaan, so timber is particularly expensive.
On Greenland, it is sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he headed further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it this name.
But regardless of his findings, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country is considered "Scandinavian," there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think that there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not the case. Although there are some handwritten notes on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The text on the back of the "United States Declaration of Independence" is "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." The text is written upside down at the bottom.
Although no one knows who wrote this text, it is certain that this large parchment document (approximately 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was originally stored rolled up.
Therefore, it is very likely that this passage was added merely for labeling purposes.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
The area was governed by the French "Vichy" regime. These French people coexisted peacefully with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders rather than opposing them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies launched an attack on southern France, historically known as "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the American forces and the Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant number of people (i.e., a society) who live and work together cooperatively.
The term "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," meaning "of the citizen." It is related to the Latin words "civis" and "civitas," which mean "citizen" and "city or city-state," respectively, which in a way also defines the scale of a society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations, and civilization and culture refer to the knowledge passed down through several generations, continuous cultural footprints, and widespread dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving historical traces and cannot be recognized as orthodox civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, these thirteen states first established a fragile central government under the Articles of Confederation (with Congress being its only institution).
Congress did not have the power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial branch, it had to rely on the often uncooperative state authorities to enforce the laws.
It also does not have the power to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
These regulations require the unanimous consent of all states for any amendments, and the states' attitude towards the central government is very casual, with their representatives often absent.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are both the second most successful teams in the world, and they are also the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, inline hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians also participate in related international and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to Japan having a group of islands, from a geographical perspective, Japan is often classified as an "archipelago."
The beginning of Taiwan's history can be traced back to the 15th century, when European sailors recorded the name of the island as Formosa, meaning "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the indigenous people's grain production methods, and employed Chinese laborers to work in the company's rice and sugarcane fields.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) government took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan by force, and in 1885 declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Dynasty.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan. Japan then began its rule over Taiwan, which lasted until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures: the Intihuatana Stone, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the ruins have been reconstructed to give tourists a better understanding of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still images in the world is 35mm, which was also the primary film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio of digital camera sensors has inherited its dimensions.
In fact, that 35 mm format is somewhat confusing: it is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by 12 to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the Advanced Photo System format) are identical to or close to this aspect ratio.
The often abused and ridiculed Rule of Thirds is a simple guideline that, while fostering creativity, also keeps the composition orderly.
It indicates that after dividing the image vertically and horizontally into thirds, the intersections of the lines are the most effective positions for the subject of the photo (see example).
During this period in European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under intense scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, despite the differences in language and customs that still exist, Christianity has kept the European countries closely connected.
Its omnipresent power influences everyone, from the king to the common people.
Christianity has a primary tenet, which is that wealth must be used to help the suffering and the poor, and the funds of the church are established specifically for this reason.
For over a thousand years, the core of the Church's power has been located in Rome. This concentration of power and money has led many to question whether the Church truly follows this doctrine.
Shortly after the outbreak of the war, Britain began to impose a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy of cutting off the supply of essential military and civilian materials has indeed been effective, although this type of blockade violates international regulations established through various international agreements over the past two centuries, which have been widely accepted by countries.
The United Kingdom has laid mines in international waters to prevent any vessel from entering the entire area, even endangering neutral ships.
Due to the lack of response from various countries to this tactic, Germany believed that their unrestricted submarine warfare would not result in a strong backlash.
In the 1920s, the general attitude of most citizens and the nation was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the fear and atrocities of World War I, all countries hoped to avoid such situations from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with Edison’s company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison written by Charles Batchelor, his former manager.
In ancient China, unique methods were used to denote different periods; each stage of China or ruling family belonged to distinctly different dynasties.
During the time of dynastic change, it was also a period of regional fragmentation and turmoil, the most famous of which was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, many nobles engaged in fierce wars to compete for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands losing their lives in the struggle to claim the throne in the grand palace of Xi'an.
The revolution brought about many social and political impacts, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than to the monarch alone.
Moreover, after the revolution, various positions were opened to all men actively seeking employment, allowing those with the most willingness and achievement to take charge.
The same situation also occurs in the military, as they no longer use ranks to distinguish military grades, but base it on ability.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working classes in many other countries to start revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in transcending the material world. He often went to a cave called "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has undergone changes over time, showcasing the vivid spirit of Muhammad.
The cave is located on the summit of a mountain north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even if someone knows of its existence, it is not easy to find. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated from the world.
You can see nothing but the clear and beautiful sky above and the surrounding mountains; within the cave, you can only see or hear a small part of the world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, and it is one of the many large pyramid structures constructed to commemorate the deceased pharaohs.
Located on the Giza Plateau of Egypt's Valley of the Kings, or the "Giza Pyramid Complex," it includes several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest in the world), several small tombs, several temples, and the gigantic Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" symbol looks like a V, while the "down bow" symbol looks like a staple, or a square with an opening at the bottom.
The upper part indicates that you should start pushing the bow from the tip, and the lower part indicates that you should start pulling the bow from the root (the place where your hand holds the bow).
The up-bow mark usually represents a softer sound, while the down-bow mark represents a stronger and more resolute sound.
Feel free to make marks with a pencil, but please remember that the printed bowing marks on the page serve a musical purpose and should not be ignored.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), along with the king's sister Princess Élisabeth, were forced to move from the Palace of Versailles back to Paris by a group of market women on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a mob along the way, with the people shouting and hurling threats at the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows.
At one point, a mob member even waved the head of a royal guard in front of the terrified queen, the guard having been killed at the Palace of Versailles.
The war expenditure for the American imperialist conquest of the Philippines was borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime, covering most of the government expenses, while the bond interest was floated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the exorbitant profits that the United States has long extracted from exploiting the Filipino people have become the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to the founding of this organization.
This period in which these events occurred is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, which are the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries in European history (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages succeeded the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, and it is traditionally believed that the Middle Ages ended around the year 1500.
The term technological determinism encompasses a number of practiced concepts, ranging from technology-driven or technology-led change to the more rigorous idea that "the related logic behind scientific laws and their manifestations in technology will drive human destiny."
Most interpretations of technological determinism contain two main ideas: the path of technological development itself has a much greater influence than cultural or political factors, and technology, in turn, "influences" the inherent patterns of society rather than being constrained by society.
For example, some people say that cars will inevitably promote the development of roads.
However, building a nationwide highway network for a small number of cars does not meet economic benefits, so people developed new manufacturing methods to reduce the cost of car ownership.
An increase in the number of people owning cars will lead to a higher likelihood of road accidents, prompting the development of new medical techniques for repairing injured limbs.
Cultural determinism is an important component of Romanticism, often drawing from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, the geographical environment shapes the individual and, over time, produces customs and culture related to that geographical environment. These customs and culture, being in harmony with the local society, are better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is acclaimed as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was also acclaimed as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
Its status gradually declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders had returned with souvenirs such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than what was sold in the Byzantine market.
It was at this moment that the title of the fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was greatly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles might lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a unique style. A major advancement at that time was that members of the Crusades started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is a type of farming where crop yields are just enough to feed the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple agricultural system that usually practices organic farming, preserves and uses seeds of native crops from local ecozones, and employs crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and many developing countries still do.
Subculture brings together people with similar interests who also feel ignored by mainstream society, thereby generating a sense of identity.
Subcultures are often distinguished by the age group, race, class, geographic location, or gender of their members.
The traits that establish a subculture may be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or various factors.
Members of subcultures typically express their belonging to the group through special and symbolic forms, including clothing, behavior, and the use of jargon.
A common method used to explain the importance of socialization is to cite several unfortunate cases where children were neglected, suffered misfortunes, or were deliberately abused in their growth process, thus missing the socialization process imparted by adults.
These children are called "feral children." Some feral children have been subjected to confinement (often by their parents); in some cases, children have been abandoned because their parents do not accept their severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Street children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Other children are said to have been raised by animals; some are claimed to have lived alone in the wild.
If a feral child is entirely raised by non-human animals, they will exhibit behavior almost identical to the animals that cared for them (given physiological conditions allow), such as showing fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, while scaffolding takes it to the next level.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a support that can provide assistance to those undergoing new learning experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and physical; in other words, teachers and the Microsoft Office Clippy are both forms of scaffolding.
The virtual scaffolding is already built into the software, functioning to ask questions, provide prompts, and explain processes that students might find difficult to handle independently.
Children are sent to foster centers for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment lacking nurturing, care, and education, but the reality is not so.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
Foster families should provide all the necessities that were lacking in their previous family.
The internet combines the elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
Considering the approaches of use and satisfaction, the distinct characteristics of the internet have opened up new horizons.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" can both be said to be important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
In the study of audience reactions to websites in the paper by Eighmey and McCord (1998), it was found that "personal involvement" and "enduring relationships" are also new motivational dimensions.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
Especially, some people believe that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," pointed out that people who are unable to understand the content of a speech due to brain damage can still accurately sense the speaker's sincerity.
He even believes that domestic dogs and other animals might have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century shows there are two types of gene variations: recessive and dominant.
Mutations introduce new genetic variations, while natural selection removes them from the pool of dominant variations.
In every generation, separation and recombination cause dominant and recessive groups of genes to continuously change.
The digestive system, similar to that of humans and primates, finds it difficult to obtain sufficient amino acids from plants on the savannah.
In addition, insufficient intake of amino acids can lead to severe consequences: stunted growth and malnutrition, ultimately resulting in death.
The most accessible plant resources should be the proteins obtained from leaves and pods, but unless they are cooked, they are difficult for primates like us to digest.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide high-quality protein containing all essential amino acids.
After taking all factors into consideration, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a manner similar to modern-day savanna chimpanzees.
Sleep interruption means deliberately waking up during a regular sleep period and then falling back asleep within a short period of time (10-60 minutes later).
By using a relatively quiet alarm clock, you can easily do this by being conscious without fully waking up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put the alarm clock on the other side of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other choices based on physiological cycles include drinking a large amount of fluid (especially water or tea, a recognized diuretic) before bed, which makes it necessary to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace in a person is inversely proportional to the degree of tension in their mind and body.
The more relaxed the body and mind, the stronger the vitality. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can attain the state of enlightenment. The only obstacles on the path to enlightenment are our own anxieties and negative energy.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has flourished due to the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is fundamentally very simple, including Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the devotional practice of embracing all sentient beings.
While practicing Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) awakens through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantra prayers, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan Buddhism meditation is deity yoga. By visualizing deities and Buddhas, all energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is established.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, prompting cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the end of the war, conflicts in terms of systems, practices, and culture created discord between these countries.
The original allies became enemies just two years after the end of World War II, and the Cold War began.
It continued for forty years with proxy armies engaged in actual battles on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had fallen, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup near the bridgehead in Romania.
However, these plans were all scrapped overnight. More than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops violated the Treaty of Riga, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements to invade eastern Poland, subsequently entering Belarus and Ukraine, forming the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the sea.
Traditionally, the mission of the navy is to ensure the nation's people and goods can be securely transported while disrupting the operations of enemy countries in moving personnel and goods.
One of the most notable examples in modern times is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. The Americans attempted to transport personnel and materials to the other side of the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy attempted to block transportation (primarily using U-boats).
If the Allies were defeated, Germany might conquer Britain as it did other parts of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them in order to obtain milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats are generally grazed on hills or other pasturing areas, usually tended by child or teenage goat herders, similar to the more widely known shepherds. These herding methods are still in use today.
England built tramways as early as the 16th century.
Although the four-wheeled freight track was composed only of parallel wooden planks, it allowed horses to pull freight along the track, which was faster and could carry more cargo compared to the slightly rugged roads at that time.
Sleepers have been used to fix the tracks very early on. But gradually, it was discovered that laying down iron bars made the tracks more efficient.
This became a common practice, but iron would cause more wear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Finally, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron railway appeared.
The earliest known form of transportation was walking, and with the emergence of Homo Erectus (i.e., upright man), humans began walking upright two million years ago.
Their evolutionary predecessors, the Australopithecines, were not accustomed to walking upright.
The characteristic of bipedal locomotion was found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus might have walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living a more environmentally friendly life, we can participate in environmental movements, and we can even become social activists to minimize future suffering.
In many situations, this is like "curing the head when there's a headache, curing the foot when there's a footache." However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, then we should identify the root of the problem and solve it thoroughly.
This world has changed due to the progress of human science and technology, and the problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and humanity's wasteful lifestyle, which couldn't be more obvious.
After being passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the John Dunlap printing shop a few blocks away.
150 to 200 copies were printed throughout the night, now called "Dunlap's single-sided printing edition."
The document was first publicly read by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 known existing copies of the Dunlap broadside are the oldest surviving versions of this document, as the original manuscript has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived to the present, and we call them birds.
Because they have feathers and can fly, many people do not consider them a type of dinosaur.
However, birds and dinosaurs still have many similarities.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T. rex.
In fact, all computers now are based on messages composed of operating binary codes.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits in computer terminology.
Poisoning in the body may not show immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are too common to make a direct diagnosis.
The best way to determine signs of poisoning in the body may be to find opened containers of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the first aid instructions on the specific poison label.
The term "bedbug" is the formal designation used by entomologists for this type of insect.
The name comes from the ancient understanding of bedbugs—they are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs have the characteristic of nesting growth, allowing them to adapt to life in nests or the homes of their hosts.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States, making it a leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a condition that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
Couples may determine that raising a baby is not in their or their child's best interest.
These couples can choose to plan the adoption of their children.
Adoption refers to the termination of parental rights by the biological parents, allowing another couple to raise their child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through scientific methods. This approach actually guides most scientific research.
However, the experimental method is not the only one; experiments are tests that can eliminate one or more hypotheses, and asking questions and making observations can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
All of Aristotle's views on scientific issues, including psychology, have been accepted.
As Greek scholarship declined, the Western world severed its links with the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many scholars have observed physiological and behavioral rhythms that often heavily depend on the endogenous biological cycles and the substances produced by their biological clocks.
Circadian rhythms that respond not only to external cyclical cues can be observed in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that continues to autonomously operate in cycles even without external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the major experiments showing that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments: one involved labeling the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus, and the other involved labeling the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of mutations can vary depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be inherited by offspring, while mutations in other areas can lead to cell death or cancer.
Tour itineraries with a focus on nature will attract people interested in the great outdoors to enjoy natural landscapes, including wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks to study information about ecosystems.
For example, visit Borneo to observe, photograph, and learn about orangutans.
Every morning, a group of people drives away from the small rural town to their workplace, passing by another group whose starting point is exactly the workplace of the first group.
In this busy traffic interchange, everyone has some degree of connection to this private car-based transportation system, which also supports its existence.
Nowadays, science indicates that this large-scale carbon economic activity has caused the biosphere to deviate from the stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in social activities and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about issues like water quality and bridge collapses.
Why does the transportation system attract these complaints, and why are there problems every day? Is it because the transportation engineers are not competent enough, or is there a more fundamental reason?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement patterns of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations, as well as the interactions between road users.
The problem is that studying traffic flow is very difficult because driving habits cannot be predicted with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, driving behavior tends to fall within a reasonably consistent range, so traffic flow also tends to have reasonable consistency, and can be roughly expressed mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, we have defined the relationship between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships contribute to the planning, design, and operation of transportation facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly allows them to evade predators more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings along their bodies.
This gives them more little places to burrow into to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but many hold the opposite view; they believe that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
This seems reasonable because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on Earth and has the greatest water volume. Its water volume is eight times that of the world's second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with some sections reaching up to six miles in width.
Of all the river water flowing into the oceans on Earth, a full 20% comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River's main stream is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, gathering water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the scale and exceptional technique of the Giza pyramids were unparalleled.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the historical relics left behind by their ancestors, which were already over a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the smallest population.
The laws and official documents of the Vatican are in Italian.
Italian is also the language commonly used by most of the working population in the country, while Latin is mostly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper because these elements exist in their natural form in the environment and can be extracted quite easily using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle argued that all things are composed of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (arranged in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also inferred that they would transform into new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys can also contain small amounts of non-metal elements (such as carbon).
All things in the universe are made up of matter, and all matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, so small that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, when pencils first came out, they became good friends to many people.
Unfortunately, with the rise of new writing methods, the status and usage of pencils have gradually declined.
Everyone now writes messages on computer screens, and pencil sharpeners are no longer needed.
We can only be curious and wait for new inventions to appear, wondering what will happen to the keyboard.
The operational principle of a nuclear fission bomb is based on the fact that fusing numerous protons and neutrons into an atomic nucleus requires a substantial amount of energy.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the atomic nucleus again will subsequently release a portion of that energy.
Some atomic nuclei are unstable, which means they can easily split with little or no external force.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about seventy kilometers thick at the near end and about one hundred kilometers thick at the far end.
It is thinner under the lunar mare, while it is thicker under the highlands.
Perhaps there are more lunar mares on the near side due to a thinner crust. Magma is more likely to rise to the surface here.
The core of content theory is to find out what moves or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that become internalized in the process of growing up.
These theoretical discussions explore what makes certain people want certain things and what in their environment makes them want to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory are two popular content theories.
Generally speaking, when a supervisor begins to lead former peers, two behaviors may emerge. One of them is attempting to maintain themselves as still being a member of the peer group.
Managers of this type find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, enforce disciplinary actions, conduct performance evaluations, assign responsibilities, and hold subordinates accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, there will be a completely different person who believes they must change all the team's existing practices and adopt their own way of doing things.
After all, the leader ultimately has to take responsibility for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often creates divergences between the leader and other team members.
Virtual teams must adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members usually serve as contact points for the physical teams with which they directly collaborate.
They usually have more autonomy than traditional team members because their team might have meetings across different time zones, which their local management might not understand.
A truly "invisible management team" (excerpted from Larson and LaFasto's 1989 work, page 109) is also a unique element that constitutes a virtual team.
"Invisible team" is a management team where each member directly belongs to this team, and it sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through a time-consuming process to establish a learning institution? One of the goals of implementing the learning concept of the organization is innovation.
When each functional department within an organization effectively utilizes all available resources, it can demonstrate creativity and originality.
Therefore, the process of the organization working together to overcome obstacles can drive the innovation process to meet the needs of customers.
Before an organization possesses innovation ability, leaders should create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explained the continuity model, which is a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neuroscientific data provide concrete evidence for theoretical approaches in cognitive research, thereby narrowing and refining the scope of study.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in conducting research.
For a long time, it has been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain psychological functions.
The invention of new technology allows us to observe and study previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material for building simulation models, helping us to understand the processes of our mental operations.
Although artificial intelligence has strong science fiction connotations, it has still become a crucial branch of computer science, specializing in the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
One of the areas of artificial intelligence research is the creation of machines that can automatically perform tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnostics and problems, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and faces.
These developments have evolved into different disciplines, focusing on finding solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and are also integrated into some home computers and video game software.
Field trips are an important part of school education. Many times, teachers want to take students to places that buses cannot reach.
Technology provides virtual off-campus teaching as a solution. Students can sit in the classroom and visit museum artworks, tour aquariums, or admire beautiful art.
Sharing field trips virtually is also a great way to review the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website each year for their trip to the state capital, and while the website is redesigned annually, the old versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blogging experience with hasty and sloppy grammar and spelling, this generally changes due to the presence of readers.
Since students are usually the most critical readers, bloggers will start working hard to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Writing blogs also "forces students to better understand the world around them." To satisfy the audience's interest, it stimulates students to become more intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond traditional school life.
Correct use of blogs "can enhance students' analytical and critical abilities; students can clearly define their position within the context of articles written by others through actively responding to online materials, and also outline their viewpoints on specific issues" (O'Ravis, 2002).
Ottawa is the capital of Canada, with a beautiful and pleasant environment, where both English and French are used, and it has many galleries and museums showcasing the past and present of Canada.
Further south is Niagara Falls, while to the north are Muskoka and other regions where the natural beauty remains undeveloped.
All of these and various other factors make Ontario perceived by outsiders as a typical representation of Canada.
Vast areas further north have sparse populations, with some being almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living within the United States than the citizen population of Canada.
The East African islands are located off the eastern coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is the largest island, rich in wildlife, making the island itself a continent.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent countries or have ties to France, and are known for their luxurious beachfront resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this land, and Islam has achieved significant development in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape of Good Hope route from Europe to India.
To the north, it connects to the Sahel region, and to the south and west, it is adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers, regardless of their actual marital status, claim to be married.
Wearing a ring would also help (but don't wear one that looks too expensive).
Female friends should also understand that cultural differences may lead to situations that they consider harassment, such as being followed or having their arms grabbed, which are not uncommon.
When rejecting a man, you should be firm and not be afraid to stand your ground (regardless of cultural differences, this is not right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was established by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. It was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese razed and rebuilt the city, naming it "Casa Branca" (White House), and abandoned the place after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city, naming it "Daru I Badiya," while "Casablanca" was the name given by Spanish traders who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping places in all of Morocco.
In the area around the old city of Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, including tagines, pottery, leather products, hookahs, and a variety of fancy accessories, but these are all sold to tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, and most of the city's streets, especially downtown, were buried.
Although Goma is relatively safe, if you plan to travel outside of Goma, you must do thorough research to understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu Province.
The city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and offers some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking activities in Africa.
You can use a Boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to tour Goma, with the local price for short distances generally around 500 Congolese Francs.
Because it is relatively difficult to access by comparison, "Timbuktu" gradually became a symbol of a distant foreign land.
Present-day Timbuktu is a poverty-stricken town, but its past reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was listed as a World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desert sandstorms.
This is one of the main stops in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World."
The city has noticeable differences from other cities in the country because it tends to have an Arab rather than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and is bounded by the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,000 square kilometers and is divided into 14 ecological zones, inhabited by different species of wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is also regarded as the flagship attraction of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, this park has daily conservation and entrance fees.
Perhaps purchasing a Wild Card pass would be more cost-effective, as this pass allows you entry into certain selected parks in South Africa, or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the origin of the name of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and is also a major tourist attraction for many visitors.
Some say that the entire row of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline, set against the water of Victoria Harbour, resembles a shining, sparkling bar chart.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, you can leave Hong Kong Island and head to the Kowloon waterfront across the harbor.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed land along the northern coast.
The British colonizers claimed this place as their own, so if you're looking for evidence of colonial history on this land, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans forest is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The area located in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
This forest not only consists of mangrove swamps but also includes a part of the vast jungles that once spread across the Ganges Plain, of which now very little remains.
The Sundarbans forest covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is water or swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and the area is currently estimated to have 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart all day from the shuttle bus station (across the river), but most buses leave between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those heading east and to Jakar / Bumthang.
Due to the frequent full occupancy of the shuttle buses, it is recommended that you purchase your ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas can be reached by comfortable and sturdy Japanese Coaster buses.
Ridesharing taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting Oiapoque in Brazil with Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters tall and 378 meters long, with two lanes each 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully open to traffic in September 2017, which is when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guarani people are the most important indigenous group residing in present-day eastern Paraguay, living a semi-nomadic lifestyle while also engaging in subsistence farming.
The Chaco region is home to indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payagua, who live off hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, what is now Paraguay (formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies") was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous people.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain many of the local characteristics and features.
Argentina is famous for having world-class polo teams and players.
The biggest event of the year will be held in December at the Las Canitas polo grounds.
Other smaller tournaments or competitions are also held at other times of the year.
For information about the event and ticket purchases for polo matches, please contact the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands is located in Stanley, across from the "Falkland Islands Company (FIC) West Store," and it is the only place where you can exchange currency.
Pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted within Stanley.
It might be possible to use British or American currency in outlying island areas, but credit cards are likely not accepted; please inquire with the merchants in advance to determine the accepted payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange its currency outside the Falkland Islands, so be sure to do so before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region, where summer temperatures often exceed 30 degrees Celsius.
The winter there can be deceptively cold because the temperature seldom drops below zero, but the wind combined with the humidity makes it feel much colder than the thermometer indicates.
There is no specific "rainy season" or "dry season," and the rainfall is approximately evenly distributed throughout the year.
Even though many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wildlife is still wild after all, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities pointed out that at least a distance of 100 yards/meters should be maintained from bears and wolves, and a distance of 25 yards/meters from other wildlife.
No matter how docile they seem, bison, moose, elk, bears, and almost all large animals are aggressive.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured because they do not maintain a proper distance. These animals are large, untrained, and potentially dangerous, so please give them enough space.
In addition, be aware that scents can attract bears and other wildlife, so please avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000 people.
Apia was discovered in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, a notorious naval standoff occurred at this port when seven warships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom all refused to leave.
All the ships sank except for one British vessel. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed at a peaceful gathering in the town.
Auckland spans two harbors, so it has many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (Beigang area) are located along the Pacific coast, stretching from Changwan in the north to Devonport in the south.
Those places are almost all beaches where people can swim safely, and most of them have shade provided by New Zealand Christmas trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located at Waitemata Harbour, between Mission Bay and the affluent suburb of St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches lined with rows of shops along the shore. Swimming here is very safe.
The local main beer is "First", which is not a beer with a complex flavor, but is smooth and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
Although there are also many French wines, New Zealand and Australian wines might be more suitable for long-distance transportation.
The local tap water is very safe and can be consumed directly, but if you're unsure, bottled water is also readily available.
To Australians, "white coffee" is a foreign idea. Espresso is "espresso," cappuccino is topped with towering whipped cream (not froth), and tea does not contain milk.
The quality of the hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The juice is expensive, but it is very tasty.
There are many people traveling to the Great Barrier Reef all year round, and few of them get injured as a result.
Tourists still need to heed the authorities' advice, comply with all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, box jellyfish appear near the beaches and estuaries north of 1770. Outside of these times, they can occasionally be spotted.
Sharks do exist, however, they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not very active in the ocean; their main habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance can give travelers peace of mind, knowing they have a place to sleep upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies usually cooperate with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodations through them, such as campsites.
The travel packages offered by travel agencies usually include breakfast and round-trip airport transportation, and even provide combined flight and hotel packages.
If you need time to consider the proposal or gather other documents for your destination (such as a visa), they can also hold the reservation for you.
However, if there are any issues that need improvement or any requests, you should first contact the travel agency rather than directly contacting the hotel.
During certain festivals, most visitors attending the music festival choose to camp on-site, and most of them consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to watch the event up close, you must go in early and find a campsite near the music performance.
Please remember, even if the main stage music performance has ended, performances in other areas of the music festival may continue until late at night.
For families with young children, some festival venues will arrange dedicated camping areas.
If you are crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, please confirm the location of your cabin, as the cabins most affected will experience terrifying noise when passing through the ice floes.
The St. Petersburg cruise itinerary includes city sightseeing. Passengers on board do not need to hold a visa (check relevant regulations).
Casinos often make great efforts to keep guests staying longer and spending more. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually provide special meals, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and ensure they stay on site.
Some venues offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. However, getting drunk can impair your judgment, and good gamblers are well aware of the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who wants to drive at high altitudes or on mountain roads should consider the likelihood of encountering snow, ice, or sub-freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is very low, and you cannot drive as you would on regular asphalt roads.
During a blizzard, a sufficient amount of snow can fall in a very short time, rendering you immobile.
Snowfall or blowing snow, condensation, or icing on the windows can all reduce visibility.
On the other hand, in many countries, snowy and icy climates are quite common, and transportation is almost uninterrupted year-round.
Safari can be said to be the most attractive tourist element in Africa and a highlight of many visitors' journeys.
The term "Safari" generally refers to journeys on land to admire the magnificent African wildlife, especially the flora and fauna of the savanna.
Animals like elephants and giraffes tend to approach cars, so standard equipment allows you to see them more clearly.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes are afraid of people getting close, making it more suitable to observe them with binoculars.
A wilderness hiking trip (also known as a jungle walk, wild hike, or trekking) includes mountain climbing, and the duration of the journey can be several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with several events taking place in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, with the previous one being held in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, the situation you face might be a bit tricky.
Cancellation policies vary by company, but most of the cancellation policies established due to the coronavirus were not extended to July 2020, the original date for the Olympics.
Most event ticket prices are expected to range between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with the average price being around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes helps to dry them. Even if ironing boards and irons are not provided in hotel rooms, many hotels allow guests to borrow them.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer to dry the socks, if you have one.
Be careful not to let the temperature of the fabric get too high (it may lead to shrinkage, and in extreme cases, it may scorch).
Among many methods of water purification, some can more effectively address specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in other areas, several minutes are required.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have any concerns, you might consider purchasing sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Visitors may encounter animal pests that are not commonly seen in their hometowns.
Pests can damage food and cause discomfort, even worse, they may cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that harm or kill people, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods without tax and consumption tax in certain areas.
Travelers visiting high-tax countries can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on items such as tobacco and alcohol.
The section between Bone Marien and Fairmont passes through many remote and desolate areas and is regarded as the most difficult section to drive on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway.
If you are not accustomed to driving on country roads, please stay alert: steep slopes, narrow paths, and sharp turns are prevalent.
The speed limit is noticeably lower than the previous and next sections of the road, generally 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 kilometers per hour), and strictly adhering to these speed limits is even more important than on other sections.
However, what is curious is that the mobile communication service here is much stronger than other sections along the way, such as the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German pastries are very delicious, and the pastries from the Bavarian region are rich and varied, similar to their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples being made into pastries year-round, and cherries and plums appearing on the table in the summer.

Indonesian cuisine, composed of food from over 17,000 islands, is a general term that encompasses the country's wide variety of regional dishes.
However, when used without other modifiers, this term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Nowadays, in all of Indonesia, Javanese cuisine, which mainly consists of various simply seasoned dishes, is commonly enjoyed. The most frequently used seasonings are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are used to support the rider's feet hanging on either side of the saddle.
They can provide more stability for the rider, but there is a safety concern that the rider's feet might get stuck.
If a rider falls off a horse but one foot gets caught in the stirrup, they may be dragged as the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, many safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Additionally, some saddles (especially English saddles) have safety handles that, when pulled back during a fall, allow the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle.
Cochamó Valley, Chile's premier rock climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, boasts a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.

Alpine skiing, which includes both skiing and snowboarding, is a widely popular sport that involves fastening skis or a snowboard to both feet and then sliding down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is a popular tourist event that many people love, and these people are sometimes referred to as ski enthusiasts. Their entire vacation plan revolves around skiing, and they stay at specific locations.
The concept of skiing has existed for a long time, and as early as 5000 BC, cave paintings depicted people skiing.
The sport of alpine skiing can be traced back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians established the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also known as mountain skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
This activity is similar to alpine ski mountaineering, but usually does not involve alpine skiing and mountaineering, which take place in steep terrain and require sturdier skis and boots.
Imagine the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
When conditions are good, the distance covered by skiing with a load on snow will be slightly longer than hiking, but you rarely reach the speed of skiing without a load on a cleared snow trail.
Although the European continent is relatively small, it is home to many independent countries. Generally, traveling between several countries means having to apply for several visas and undergo multiple passport checks.
However, in this respect, the functioning of the Schengen Area is like that of a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, generally speaking, you can cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you hold a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each member country of the Schengen area separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universally applicable definition of which man-made items are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiques.
Different geographical regions have different definitions, and in places like North America, the age limits may be shorter than those in Europe.
Although handicrafts have existed for a shorter time than other mass-produced items of the same type, they may be recognized as antiques.
For the Sami people, reindeer herding is an important livelihood, and for many other Sami with different specialties, the culture surrounding the reindeer industry is equally important.
However, even traditionally, not all Sami people engaged in large-scale reindeer herding; instead, they lived by fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and regarded reindeer as draft animals for pulling and carrying loads.
Many Sami people are now engaged in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income for the Sami region.
Although the term "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, it is often considered offensive due to negative stereotypes and incorrect understanding of the Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to travel advisory restrictions, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
In addition to doing your own research, you might also want to consult the government for advice, but their recommendations are designed for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face situations different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
The consultation opinion is just a brief summary of the political situation in a certain country.
Compared to the detailed information available from other sources, the perspectives they offer are often more rough, general, and overly simplified.
Severe weather is a general term for all hazardous weather phenomena, which may cause damage, severe social disruption, or loss of life.

The course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and involves role-playing, extensive first aid training, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are quite common, but publications about war zones are rare.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must have valid return documents.
Governments of various countries may not be willing to issue passports without a specified gender (X), or update documents for individuals who wish for specific names and genders.
There is a significant variation in the extent to which different governments are willing to recognize these documents.
After September 11, 2001, the searches at security checkpoints became tougher.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to pass through the scanner without compromising their privacy and dignity.
A rip current is a wave that breaks and recedes after waves hit the beach, typically appearing near reefs or similar places.
According to the underwater topology, return waves will concentrate in a few deeper areas and may generate fast currents flowing toward the deep water in these regions.
Most of the causes of death are due to exhaustion while trying to swim back against the current, and the success rate of this action is very slim.
Once you are out of the current, swimming back to shore is no more difficult than usual.
Try to swim to a place where you won't be trapped again, or, depending on your swimming skills and whether someone has noticed you, you can also wait for rescue.
The onset of reverse culture shock is faster than culture shock (with less of a honeymoon period), lasts longer, and is more severe.
For tourists who easily adapt to new cultures, readjusting to their own native culture can sometimes be particularly difficult.
After living abroad for a period of time and returning to your home country, you have adapted to the new culture and forgotten some habits that your domestic culture instilled in you.
When you first arrive in a foreign country, others understand that travelers who are new to an unfamiliar country need time to adjust, and they mostly treat you with patience and understanding.
However, for those returning home, people may feel there's no need to tolerate and understand them anymore.

The image is displayed on the pyramid, while the lights illuminate the other pyramids.
Several countries have claimed the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, as their territory. This island has the most bases, with sixteen active bases by 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which is home to the human settlement of the town of Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, the latter being a caldera of an active volcano, which when flooded, forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is located in the southern part of the peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountain ranges on the peninsula converge here to form a highland, then reappear as the Ellsworth Mountains stretching over 360 kilometers, which are divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
Vinson Massif, the highest mountain range in Antarctica, has an elevation of 4,892 meters and is located in the northern part of Antarctica, also known as the Sentinel Range.
In remote areas where mobile signals cannot reach, you may only be able to use a satellite phone.
Generally speaking, satellite phones cannot replace mobile phones because you must be outdoors and aligned with a satellite to make a call.
Ships (including pleasure craft and expedition ships with remote data and audio needs) frequently use this service.
The local telecommunications service provider you belong to should be able to offer more information about connecting to this service.
For those planning a gap year, an increasingly popular option is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among recent graduates, allowing them to have a year off before finishing university without sacrificing their studies.
Many times, participating in a gap year program overseas can actually enhance your chances of receiving higher education upon returning to your country.
Generally speaking, participating in these educational programs requires paying tuition.
Finland is an excellent place for rowing. Known as the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," it is also home to thousands of lake islands or coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, small boats, and even kayaks, can offer a different experience.
Rowing is Finland's national pastime, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
Corresponding examples are Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but in other regions, it appears quite special (for example, in the Netherlands, the figure is 1 in 40).
Most Baltic exclusive cruise itineraries often stay a little longer in St. Petersburg, Russia.
In other words, you can spend several whole days visiting this historic ancient city and return to the ship to stay overnight at night.
If you are participating in a shore excursion with the cruise, no additional visa is required (as of 2009).
Some cruise itineraries include information about Berlin, Germany. As shown on the map above, Berlin is not a coastal city, so the cost of visiting it is not included in the cruise fare.
Regardless of age or background, traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience, especially for those who have never flown or have had traumatic experiences.
This is not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from many people being afraid of or having an aversion to certain things.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help them overcome fears based on the unknown or uncontrollable factors.
Courier companies deliver goods quickly to earn lucrative rewards. Time is especially crucial when transporting business documents, products, or parts for urgent repairs.
Larger companies have their own airplanes on some routes, but for other routes or smaller companies, it becomes more complicated.
If they use air transport to send things, it may take a few days to complete unloading and customs clearance on certain routes.
The only way to deliver faster is to send the goods as checked luggage. Airlines prohibit unaccompanied baggage, and this is where your opportunity arises.
The most straightforward way to get into first-class or business class is to shell out a thick wad of cash for the privilege (or even better, have the company pay for it).
However, this is not cheap: a rough calculation shows that you would need to spend about four times the price of the economy cabin to purchase a business class ticket, and eleven times the price for first class!
Generally speaking, trying to find discounted business class or first class seats on direct flights from point A to point B is futile.
The airline deeply understands that there is a core group of customers in the market willing to pay a high price in exchange for quickly and comfortably reaching their destination.
The capital of the Republic of Moldova is Chișinău. The official language there is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.

Many men and women who were there at the time survived, while the loved ones of many more were killed or worked to death here, regardless of whether they were Jewish or not.
Please treat this site with the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Please do not make marks or graffiti on the buildings to avoid damaging the appearance of the attraction.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority can understand it, and almost everyone understands Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only displayed in Catalan because it is the legally mandated first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other places.
The fixed announcements on the subway are only in Catalan, but the automated system also unexpectedly interrupts with messages in multiple languages such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are notoriously self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although living in Paris is often said to require putting on your best face, this statement tends to be an inaccurate stereotype; however, behaving in a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) way still makes it easier for you to thrive socially.
If you display basic courtesy, the apparent rudeness of Parisians will quickly disappear.
The forests of Plitvice Lakes National Park are lush, dominated by beech, spruce, and fir trees, blending alpine and Mediterranean plant landscapes.

Similarly, men must wear pants that cover their knees.
You can also borrow inventory at the entrance, but these clothes are not cleaned after each user wears them, so you may feel slightly uncomfortable wearing these skirts. Men's clothing is one size only!
The cuisine of Mallorca is similar to other Mediterranean areas, focusing on bread, vegetables, and meats (especially pork), and commonly uses olive oil.

Pre-modern observatories are usually outdated today and continue to be used as museums or educational facilities.
Due to the fact that light pollution was not as severe during the heyday of pre-modern observatories as it is today, they were usually located in cities or campuses, making them more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are large facilities located in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, also known as "Hanami," has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.

Many non-believers in predominantly Christian countries, as well as people around the world who do not practice Christianity, have also adopted these holiday traditions.
A traditional activity during Easter is to stay awake all night outdoors and watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is likely that it was a spring and harvest ritual that existed before the emergence of Christianity.
More traditional churches usually hold an Easter Vigil prayer meeting on Saturday night of the Easter weekend, and at midnight, the participating faithful celebrate the resurrection of Jesus together.
All the animals that initially came to this island arrived by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals are unable to cross the sea, making giant tortoises the main herbivores of the Galapagos Islands.
