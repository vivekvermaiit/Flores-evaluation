This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but also provides details that fossils cannot give, such as color or three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown with pale or carotenoid-colored lower edges.
The discovery also provides understanding about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but do have other characteristics of feathers — barbs and barbules — the researchers concluded that the rachis is likely a later evolutionary development than those other characteristics.
According to the structure of the feathers, it is assumed that they were not used for flying, but more likely for temperature regulation or display. The researchers conjectured that the specimen shows an adult plumage and not juvenile down, although it is a tail of a young dinosaur.
The researchers speculated that the specimen shows adult plumage and not juvenile down, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur.

The work done was mostly theoretical, however, the program was written to simulate observation made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team sought the effect that would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way also applies a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter influences other dark matter in the manner of ordinary matter.
This theory says that the darkest matter around a galaxy surrounds the galaxy like a kind of halo and consists of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant is "very much concerning and alarming, because it has a very high mortality rate".
Some patients may have been infected by the bacteria in the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and at least two of them are health workers from the hospital.
During one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people close to them.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of tuberculosis patients seems to be small; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 infected at any given time in South Africa.

In France, voting has traditionally been a technologically simple experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place the pre-printed paper slip indicating their preferred candidate into an envelope.
After officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law quite strictly codifies the procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes before the start of the election and that no envelopes are added other than those of the duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each stage of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under careful supervision, according to specific procedures.

The police of Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Assistant to the Chief Inspector D K Arya said: "We have arrested five persons who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with masked faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
At first, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has remained in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court, accused of the murder of her son.
She is being held awaiting official charges and trial, but any witness deposition may be influenced, as her image has been widely publicized.
It is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish law functions differently, and courts regard the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee observes: "Journalists indeed seem to approach a dangerous line when they publish photos or other details about suspects."
Crown Office, which is generally responsible for prosecution, explained to journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the charge is filed.
The document, according to the leak, will reference the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to have based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other relevant topics will reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of an agreement, while the PA agrees to allow the presence for only five years.
Shooters in the pest control trial had to be closely monitored by the foresters, while the trial was being studied and its effectiveness assessed.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Australian Sporting Shooters Association (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are recruited as part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, deputy to the Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at NPWS, the four selected for the first shooting operation shooters received detailed instructions on safety and training.
Martelly yesterday swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's first CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEO as part of measures to advance the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the failed organization of elections, some of which had been postponed since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of non-functional iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) informed that 27 accidents related to the devices are known to them.
Last week MEKI announced that Apple informed it about 34 new overheating incidents, which the company calls "minor."
The ministry responded by calling the delay of the report by Apple "truly regrettable."
The earthquake shook Mariano at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The crisis management office of the Northern Marianas said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong as hostages by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Some hostages were released, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, among them children and the elderly, were released earlier, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced an old woman who needed a toilet. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed the example of his father and chose a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth during his free time.
His research showed that the administration of the hormone accelerated the maturation of the fetal lung in the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes', flight recorders, on Wednesday.
Other wrestler colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. Quite unique, like herself. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was as bizarre as I... maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place."
Out of 1400 people surveyed before the federal elections of 2010, the number of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard asserted during the campaign for the 2010 federal elections that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the opinion poll share this viewpoint, wishing that Queen Elizabeth II be the last Australian monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist had to swim 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, there were doubts about his ability.
He could not use the medications needed to endure his pain because they are banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery, using various devices and software, until the early days of February, and it was declared on Tuesday.
Comets may eventually be a source of water supply for Earth, as well as of organic matter, which can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed, as comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his administration earlier this year and last month signed a bill that legalizes same-sex marriages.
He mentioned the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
He will probably try to be elected as president in 2016.
NextGen is a system which, according to the FAA's claims, will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and also reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast to older terrestrial radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being operated, and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley, nor are parking facilities or park-and-ride options available at the location.
Fear of lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the game would have to be played behind closed doors, without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the magazine Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process likely took more time due to mating between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into a great variety of forms. It can be rolled out to thin forms.
It can be drawn to obtain a thin wire, which can be bent and woven. It can be hammered or rolled flat into a sheet.
One can make it very thin and glue it to another metal. It can be so thin that it was once used to embellish hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
That is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using beet juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been deprived of their electrons (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean wet hands, compress them into a ball shape.
Moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will make you feel strange and form something like a shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet in almost every house, connected to a complex system of canals.
Remains of drainage systems were found in the houses of Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Restrooms also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, restrooms were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the phone call and reflects it downward, almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and vision.
One needs a gigantic rocket more than 100 feet tall to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing enabled by the wheel is the provision of much easier and faster transportation.
Because of it, we have trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey on a scale from hares to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including homeless pet cats) that eat the much more numerous prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, specialization, which each cat retains, so they do not have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats; they live in groups called prides.
A herd consists of one to three related adult males and many to thirty females and offspring.
The females are usually closely related to each other, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides function quite similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, which surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to prey.
A very harmonious athlete, the tiger can climb (although not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull five times stronger than a strong man.
Tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) with lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but more like a phrase of hoarse, abrupt words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds whenever possible.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find edible animals (prey) by smell, sniffing the traces on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in the surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originates (as if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
That new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need, in order to be a strong competitor, to have different traits or adaptations compared to those they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
With the passage of time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they start to look less and less similar to the other population.
Finally, with the passage of thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans inhale, and they remove carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the foods we eat are vegetables. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaur was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an additional set in its palate, meaning that nothing that encountered it could escape.
I am not sure, but it could be that it had a bifurcated tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe it was even a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water, even a giant dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus would stand no chance against it.
Although we would recognize most of their food, the Romans did have their array of strange or unusual feast items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women ate their food sitting in chairs, rich men liked to have feasts together, where they would lie on their sides, eating their dishes.
Among the dishes of Ancient Rome, there could not have been foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests endeavored to attend to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and also an inner sanctuary, which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Once special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were constructed as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not as important.
The greatest part of the life of a Hebrew family took place in the fresh air.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were simply open stalls facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and heading further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776."
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in the early days of its existence the large parchment document (its size is 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled for storage.
So probably the note was added simply as a label.
The landings on D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south remained unfree.
It was governed by the French of "Vichy." These were French people who reconciled with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15th, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
After only two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
Civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and that somehow defines the dimension of the society.
City-states are predecessors of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge through several generations, a lasting cultural trace, and a sufficiently large dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government — with Congress as its sole component — under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any power to collect taxes and, since there was no national executive or judiciary, it entrusted the execution of its decisions to state authorities, who were often uncooperative.
It also did not have the right to override tax laws and customs duties between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before any change, and states related to the central government so casually that their representatives were often absent.
The national football team of Italy, as well as the national football team of Germany, are the second most successful teams in the world and were champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, so Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the collection/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical sense, as an "archipelago."
The beginning of Taiwan started long ago in the 15th century, when European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, transforming the indigenous ways of grain production and employing Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) occupied western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and proclaimed Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, under which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better impression of how they originally looked.
Until 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu was restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format in the world for taking still images is 35 mm, which was the dominant film dimension at the close of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its proportion was inherited from the sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 34 mm high.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Several popular formats (such as the APS format system) are equal or very close to this proportion.
The much-insulted and often ridiculed rule of thirds is simply a guideline creating dynamism, maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective position of the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period in European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, became the object of critical examination.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united European states despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its all-pervasive power touched everyone from the king to the citizen.
One of the main Christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds exist specifically for that purpose.
For more than a thousand years, the central authority of the church was in Rome, and this concentration of power and money made many doubt whether that dogma is being obeyed.
Soon after the outbreak of fighting, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved its effectiveness, it cut off crucial military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, even endangering neutral ships.
Since such a tactic had limited reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted military use of submarines.
During the 1910s, the dominant attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and brutalities of war during the First World War, nations wished to avoid a return to such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a position at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous workplace) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own way of indicating various time periods; each era in China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
Among all dynasties, there was also an unstable era of divided provinces. The most well-known of such periods was the Era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those periods, fierce fighting took place among many nobles struggling for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the highest throne in the grand palace in Xi’an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, positions were open to all male candidates, which allowed for the success of the most ambitious and successful.
The same is true for the soldiers, because instead of military ranks previously based on class, they were now based on personality.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohamed was deeply interested in matters beyond this everyday life. He frequented a cave, which became known as "Hira'" on Mount "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has been preserved through time, gives a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is absolutely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easily found, even if one knows that it exists. When one is in the cave, it is total isolation.
Nothing else is visible except the cloudless, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramid structures constructed to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and among the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples, many were constructed to honor the wives and family members of Khufu.
The "arch up" mark looks like a V and the "arch down" mark like a bracket or a square without the lower side.
Up means that you must start at the tip and push the bow, and down means that you must start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Drawing the bow upward usually produces a more delicate sound, while the downward bow is stronger and firmer.
Don't hesitate to add your own marks in pencil, but remember that the printed bowings are there for a musical reason, so they usually should be observed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister Madam Elizabeth were brought back to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women on October 6, 1789.
They traveled to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a crowd, shouting and yelling threats against the king and queen.
The crowd caused the king and queen to open the windows of the carriage widely.
At one point, a mob member waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles before the frightened queen.
The military expenditures of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses and the percentage of the bonds circulating in the name of the Philippine government through the banks of Wall Street.
Of course, the superprofits extracted from the vast exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that helped the founding of the order.
The era when the events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000—1300 AD).
Before the High Middle Ages was the Early Middle Ages, and it was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ends by agreement around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that practically covers a wide range of ideas, from technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influences, and that technology in turn has for societies "consequences" essentially its own, and not socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for only a handful of cars, so new production methods are being designed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the road, which leads to the invention of new healthcare techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, taken from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, the geography shaped individuals and over time customs and culture related to that geography emerged, and those, more harmonious with the location of the society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital in the contemporary world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 B.C. and lasted until around 1100 B.C.
In the twelfth century, its status declined mainly because the crusaders returned bearing silks and spices considered more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine bazaars.
It was at that time that the title of Fashion Capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th–11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow means of communication, styles in the West could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the significant achievements of the period was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture done to produce enough food solely for the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using saved seeds native to the ecoregion with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, the majority of farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still true in many developing nations.
Subcultures unite people with similar viewpoints who feel overlooked by social norms, and allow them to foster a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The determining characteristics of a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Subcultural members often signify their membership through a recognizable and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, affectation, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to mention the few unfortunate cases of children who, during their upbringing due to neglect, misfortune, or malicious mistreatment, were not socialized by adults.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, such abandonment of a child was due to the parents' rejection of a serious intellectual or physical disability of the child.
Wild children may have experienced severe mistreatment or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are reportedly raised by animals; some are said to have lived in nature independently.
Raised only by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limitations) almost entirely similar to those of the specific caregiving animal, as well as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes an additional step.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a tool that provides support to individuals within a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, both a teacher is a variant of scaffolding and the little paperclip in Microsoft Office.
A virtual scaffold is built into software and must ask, suggest, and explain procedures that might be difficult for the learner if he were acting independently.
Children find themselves in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not supportive, caring, and educational, yet that still happens.
We regard the guardianship system as a safety net for such children.
Our foster care system must provide secure homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Custodianship must provide everything necessary that they lacked in the house from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The special features of the Internet add additional dimensions to the uses and gratifications theory.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified “personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” as new motivational aspects when they explored public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has resulted in significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
It is specifically claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks in his article The President's Speech indicated that people who cannot understand speech due to brain trauma can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even supposes that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and represented.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the group of visible variation.
Division and recombination remix the variation back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its needs for amino acids from the available plants.
Additionally, failing to do so has serious consequences: reduced growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible resources from plants would be proteins obtainable from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest if they are not cooked.
On the other hand, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide high-quality proteins that contain the essential amino acids.
Considering all circumstances, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way similar to how chimpanzees do in the savanna today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your usual sleep period and falling back asleep after a short time (10–60 minutes).
You can easily do that by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to regain consciousness without fully waking up.
If you notice that you reset the clock while you sleep, it can be left on the other side of the room, which will make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Among other options based on biorhythms, drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed will make you get out of bed to urinate.
The extent of inner peace a person has negatively correlates with the amount of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive force there is in life. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only obstacle on the path to that goal is your own tension and negativism.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded with the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
Principally, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
At the center of Tibetan meditation is the divine yoga. By visualizing various deities, one purifies the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, a clash of systems, processes, and cultures caused a separation of the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and have real battles, with proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, the only hope was to retreat and reorganize according to the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became outdated almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, breaking the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for the transportation of goods is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional role of the navy has been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time preventing your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
Most notable among the recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using U-boats, tried to stop that traffic.
If the Allies failed, Germany would likely be able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began breeding them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds roaming on hills and other pastures, often tended by goatherds, who were often children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd. These breeding methods are still used today.
Railways were being constructed in England since no later than the 16th century.
Although wagonways simply consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach greater speeds and carry heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of that time.
Railroad ties appeared early enough to keep the tracks in place. However, it gradually became clear that tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron strip on top.
That became a popular practice, but iron caused faster wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first entirely iron rails were introduced.
The earliest known transportation was by walking, people started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright as often.
Bipedal specialization is found in fossils of australopithecines from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although sahelanthropes probably walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start relating more amicably to the environment, we can join the environmental protection movement, and we can even be activists to some extent to reduce future suffering.
That is like symptomatic medication in many cases. However, if we want not just a temporary solution, then we must find the causes of the problems and we must deactivate them.
Of course, the world has been greatly changed by scientific and technological achievements of humanity, and problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle of humanity.
After the Congress adopted it on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the congressional president John Hancock and the secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the printing house of John Dunlap, a few blocks away.
During the night, they made from 150 to 200 copies, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was performed by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 posters by Dunlap, known to exist, are the oldest remaining copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives now. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble a dinosaur.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs, like a tyrannosaurus.
Almost all computers currently in use are based on processing information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, using computer slang.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are quite general, preventing an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemical.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term bug is informally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term derives from a long-standing familiarity with lice, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Rabocimoj and litocimoj are both nidicolous, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Throughout the United States, there are around 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child does not best serve their interests, or the interests of their child.
Such couples can choose to plan adoption for their baby.
During the adoption process, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides the majority of scientific research.
However, it is not alone; experiment is also involved, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, questioning and observation guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers concentrated their attention on texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As proficiency in Greek diminished, the West proved to be separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often critically depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and how the biological clock produces them.
Periodic rhythms, which do not simply respond to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue a period of repetitive autonomous functioning even without external stimuli.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the leading assumptions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, marking either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a spectrum of various effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the involved piece of genetic material, and whether the involved cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed to children, while mutations in other locations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including flora and fauna.
Among the examples of on-site activities are hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit Borneo and there take photos and learn about orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small towns by car to go to their workplace, and they are passed by others whose destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic commuting, everyone is somehow involved and contributing to a transport system based on the use of private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has been supporting human evolution for the last two million years.
Every person participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, one rarely hears a similar level of complaints about water quality or about the collapse of bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because one cannot predict a driver's behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a fairly uniform pattern; thus, traffic flows strive for some moderate uniformity and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better present traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Those relationships help plan, develop, and operate road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their flying ability helped them more easily avoid enemies and more effectively find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
That gives them a wider choice of small hiding places against predators.
Today the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seemed sensible, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the planet’s rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It collects water from several thousand smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, no one ever succeeded in surpassing the pyramids of Giza in terms of size and technical skill of their construction.
The Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its laws and official relations.
The Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements — like gold, silver, and copper — since ancient times because these can be found in nature in their basic form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
That was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he continued to theorize that they become new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that in the periodic table there are many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Certainly, there are also metals like silver and gold.
One can also have alloys in which the composition includes small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good tool for many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, due to the emergence of new ways of writing, the pencil has been demoted to a lesser status and use.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever needing to approach a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb operates on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a slope. Splitting the nucleus then releases some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no interaction.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more seas on the near side, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to pour onto the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what motivates people to act or challenges them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that were internalized during maturation to adulthood.
These theories explore what it is about certain people that makes them desire the things they do, and what things in their environment will cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors may emerge when managers begin to lead their former peers. One extreme of the spectrum is the effort to remain “one of the friends.”
That type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, assess work performance, assign tasks, and hold people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done before and take ownership of it.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often such behavior results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same high quality standards as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a traditional team because their teams can meet across various time zones, which may be misunderstood by their local managers.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal for practically applying the concepts of organizational learning is innovation.
When all available resources are efficiently used across the functioning departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process when an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the needs of clients.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. It thus narrows the research area and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior leads scientists to continue the research.
It is a long-known fact that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and alter some mental functions.
The advancement of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that were never seen before.
That provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models, which help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI has a strong nuance of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science that deals with learning and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Research in AI involves the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Among the examples are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to clients' diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Those things became separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions for real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, it is also incorporated into some home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are an important part of any education. Quite often a teacher would like to take their students to places not reachable by bus.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual tours. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing an excursion virtually is another great way to reflect on a trip and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year a new version of the website is released, but the old versions remain accessible to serve as an album.
Also, blogs can help improve writing among students. While students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "makes students become more understanding about the world around them." The need to engage the public's interest inspires students to be wise and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can enable learners to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, learners can define their positions in the context of others' writing and also outline their own viewpoints on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming bilingual capital of Canada, and it has a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
These and other matters highlight Ontario as what outsiders consider essentially Canadian.
Vast areas further north are quite sparsely populated, some are almost uninhabited wildernesses.
Here is a comparison that surprises many: there are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens in total.
The Islands of Eastern Africa are located on the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is incomparably the largest and, regarding the fauna, it is an independent continent.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent countries or linked to France, and known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, and it took root deeply in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and colonialism of Europe began in the 15th century, when the explorer Vasco da Gama from Portugal initiated the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women notice that cultural differences can result in what would be considered harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, held by the arm, etc.
Be firm when you disagree with the proposals of men and do not be afraid to stand your ground (whether cultural or not, a difference is not necessarily to be tolerated!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and it was used by Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port under the name Anfa.
Destroyed by the Portuguese, it was rebuilt by them under the name Casa Branca, but nevertheless they left after an earthquake in 1755.
The city was rebuilt by the Sultan of Morocco under the name Daru l-Badya, and the Spanish merchants, who set up trading posts there, called it Casablanca.
Regarding shopping, Casablanca is among the most uninteresting places throughout Morocco.
Around the old town center, it is easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, covering most of the city's streets with its magma, mainly in the city center.
Goma offers sufficient security, but one must inquire about each visit outside of it to know the state of the battles still occurring in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo in addition to the cheapest tracking of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to travel through Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Additionally, due to its relative inaccessibility, “Timbuktu” has been used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today Timbuktu is an impoverished city, but it is a tourist attraction due to its reputation and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was inscribed on the red list of world heritage sites due to the threatening sands from the desert.
It was one of the most important stops during the special program Wonders of the African World by PBS made by Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts greatly with the other cities of the country, as it has a style more Arabic than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in northeastern South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north to Zimbabwe, and south to the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the most iconic among the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Just like all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation entrance fees for the park.
It is also useful to buy a Wild Card, which provides entry either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives the territory of Hong Kong its name, and it is the place that many tourists view as the most interesting.
The line of buildings that forms the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a sparkling histogram, which becomes evident due to the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and cross to the front located on the Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on land reclaimed from the sea on the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonists appropriated for themselves, and therefore, if one is looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, here is a convenient place to start searching.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) along the coast into Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest in the Indian territory is named Sundarbans National Park.
The forest, however, is not just a swamp of mangroves. In it are some of the last refuges of the impressive jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², of which approximately one third is covered by water or swamps.
In 1966, Sundarbans became a reserve and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in its territory.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most leave between 6:30 and 7:30, especially those going west and to Jakar or Bumthang.
Because inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are connected by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are fast and comfortable means of transport for traveling to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River, connecting the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l’Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, it is 378 meters wide, and it has two corridors that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical under the bridge is 15 meters distant. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully operational again in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs crossings are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most remarkable indigenous group living in that area, which is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was a dwelling place for other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived from hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as "The Great Province of Indians," emerged as a result of the meeting between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began an era of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since Asuncion was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is very well known for its polo teams and players being among the best in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December in the Polish fields at Las Cañitas.
Here one can also watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
Stay informed with the Argentine Polo Association about tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is pegged to the value of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
Everywhere on the islands, British pounds are generally accepted, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
On the outer islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, but one can use British and American money; ask beforehand to know which payment method is accepted.
Because it is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, change the money before leaving.
Because Montevideo is situated south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, the temperature usually exceeds 30 °C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely becomes freezing, but the wind and humidity combine, making one feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the rainfall is almost the same throughout the entire year.
Although many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to the presence of humans, the animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities request that people stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful they look, bison, elk, deer, bears, and almost all large animals are capable of attacking.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept themselves at an adequate distance. Since these animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, respect their space.
Moreover, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, and therefore avoid bringing or cooking fragrant foods and keep the campsite clean.
The city of Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has slightly fewer than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The harbor was the site of the infamous naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. About 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the efforts towards independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the killing of the high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches thanks to its location between two harbors. The most popular ones are in three regions.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where one can swim safely, and most have shade from pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are at the Waitemata Harbour in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in Central Auckland.
They are sometimes crowded family beaches where shops line abundantly along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is Number One. It is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called Manta.
There are many drinkable wines from France, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might land better.
It is completely safe to drink the local tap water, but bottled water is easily available if one has concerns.
To Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. Espresso is "short black," a cappuccino has a generous amount of cream (not foam), and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate conforms to the standards of Belgium. Juices are expensive but excellent.
Throughout the whole year, many excursions to the reef take place, and injuries due to any of these causes are rare.
Still, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signals, and carefully pay attention to safety warnings.
Cubozos appear near beaches and estuaries from October to April, north of 1770. They can sometimes appear outside that time.
Sharks indeed exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away from them.
Marine crocodiles do not actively live in the sea. Their main habitat is estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Early booking gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep upon arriving at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, but you might be able to book other types of accommodations, like campgrounds, through such agents.
Travel agents generally arrange plans that include breakfast, transportation arrangements for airport transfers, or even combined plans with flights and hotels.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for the intended location (for example, a visa).
All changes or requests must however be directed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, the majority of attendees decide to camp on-site, and most consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that the music on the main stages may have stopped, but there might be parts of the festival where it will continue to sound until late at night.
Some festivals provide special campsites for families with small children.
If you navigate the northern Baltic in winter, be mindful of the cabin's location, because passage through ice causes quite a terrible noise in those most affected.
Cruise ships to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Passengers from cruise ships are visa-free (check the conditions).
Casinos normally strive for guests to spend the maximum of their time and money. Windows and clocks are usually not present, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and to retain them inside.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks for free, but intoxication impairs mental capability, and every good gambler is aware of how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who drives a vehicle in high latitudes or across mountain passes should be aware that there may be snow, ice, or frost.
On roads with ice or snow, friction is low and therefore one cannot drive as if on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, the amount of snow capable of blocking you can fall very quickly.
Visibility can also be limited by falling snow or wind, condensation, or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather is normal in many countries, but traffic flows mostly uninterrupted throughout the entire year.
A safari is perhaps the most attractive thing for tourists in Africa and the most outstanding for many visitors.
The word "safari" is popularly used to mean overland travel to view the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and ordinary tools provide a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes appear shy, so binoculars will help you see them better.
Walking safari (also called “field walk,” “walking safari,” or “walk”) consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be in other locations throughout Japan.
Having hosted the games in 1964, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympics.
If you booked the flights and accommodations for 2020 before the delay was announced, you are probably in a complicated situation.
Policies of cancellation vary, but, as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that tickets for most of the events will cost from 2,500 to 130,000 yen, and that typical tickets will cost around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available to borrow, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or if someone does not want to wear ironed socks, they might try using a dryer, if it is available.
Be careful that the fabric does not become too hot (which can shrink it or, in extreme cases, cause burn damage to it).
There are different means to purify water, but some are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is enough; in others, several minutes are required.
Filters have different efficiencies and, if you care about that, consider buying the water in a sealed bottle from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unknown in their home regions.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread poisons or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals capable of injuring or killing a person by force are generally not counted as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, at times traversing isolated forested areas.
If you are not used to traveling on country roads, be very careful: the most abundant are steep slopes, narrow corridors, and winding turns.
Signal speed limits are notably lower than those of preceding and following sections—often 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and they must be strictly obeyed, even more so than otherwise.
It is remarkable that cell phone service is still much stronger here than in many other sections of the road, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very delicious, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of the neighbor in the south, Austria.
There are many fruit pastries, some containing apples throughout the year, others cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes usually pair especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich cakes, try those that are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish consisting of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is typically added to curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 eligible islands, Indonesian cuisine is a huge term covering a wide range of regional cuisines across the country.
Used without additional qualifying words, the term generally refers to the cuisine originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now easily available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a variety of spicy dishes, with flavors preferred by Javanese, namely peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups hanging from both sides of the saddle serve as supports for the rider's feet.
They provide the rider with greater stability, but they can pose safety issues, as the rider's feet might potentially get caught in them.
If, while riding, one falls from a horse with their foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged by a potentially runaway horse. To minimize this risk, various safety measures can be taken.
First, the majority of riders wear riding boots with a heel and a sole that is smooth and sufficiently narrow.
Moreover, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars such that a falling rider can pull them back to detach the stirrup leather from the saddle.
Cochamó Valley: the most important place for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with various granite walls and rocks.
The mountain peaks present amazing panoramas. Climbers from every part of the world constantly create new routes from the endless possibilities of the walls.
Downhill winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which one slides down a snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to their feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, who are known as "skiing fanatics," and who plan entire vacations based on skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Downhill skiing is counted as a sport from at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians founded the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It relates to alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, but it usually does not imply them, as these latter activities occur on steep terrain and require much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as if it were like a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover distances somewhat greater than those when hiking, but very rarely will you reach the speeds of skiing without a heavy backpack on maintained trails.
Europe is a relatively small part of the world, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, to travel through multiple countries one needs to repeatedly complete visa applications and passport checks.
The Schengen Area, however, functions in this respect as if it were a single country.
Provided that one remains within this area, one can generally cross borders without the need to go through passport control points.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to separately apply for a visa to each Schengen country, which saves you time, money, and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what goods are considered antiques. Some tax agencies classify as antiques goods that are over 100 years old.
Because the definition changes locally, in places like North America the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
One could consider handicrafts as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi and the culture surrounding this trade is also important for many other craftsmen.
Even in tradition, not all Sami were engaged in large-scale reindeer herding; instead, they lived from fishing, hunting, or something similar, using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sami work in modern jobs. Tourism provides significant income to Sápmi, the Sami region.
Although the word "gypsy" is widely used, especially by non-Romani people, it is considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Romani people.
If a travel warning is issued against the country to be visited, it may affect your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance.
It is also a good idea to consult the advice of foreign governments, even though they are directed towards their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East could face situations different from those affecting Europeans or Arabs.
A warning is just a brief summary of the political situation of a certain country.
The presented views are often superficial, general, and overly simplistic compared to the more detailed information one can find elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon capable of causing damage, significant societal disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and it consists of various types, which depend on the location, the terrain, and the atmospheric conditions.
Gale, hail, excessive precipitation, and forest fires are manifestations and effects of severe weather, in addition to thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Among the regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena are blizzards, snowstorms, winter storms, and sandstorms.
It is highly advisable for travelers to be aware of any kind of severe weather risk affecting their area, as this can impact any travel plans.
Every visitor to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for a hostile environment course will most likely show the address of a local company.
The course will generally cover all the matters presented here in much more detail, normally with practical experience.
One course will normally last 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines about wilderness survival, but there are few such works about war zones.
Travelers who plan gender-reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documents for the return.
The willingness to issue passports without an indicated gender (X) or to update documents in accordance with the desired name varies from government to government.
Do foreign governments tend to accept such documents, that too varies greatly.
Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the period following September 11, 2001.
Non-operated transgender individuals should not expect to pass through scanners without their privacy and dignity remaining untouched.
Surf is a backflow of waves breaking at a beach, often at a reef or similar place.
Due to the diverse underwater formations, the backflow concentrates in a few deeper sections, where a rapid flow to the depths can form.
The majority of deaths occur as a result of attempting to swim upstream, which can be impossible.
As soon as one swims out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your abilities or whether you've been noticed, maybe you'd prefer to wait until you're rescued.
The return shock occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapted to the new culture sometimes have a particular difficulty readapting to their native culture.
Returning home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from your native culture.
When one first traveled abroad, people probably had patience and understanding, because they realized that travelers need to adapt to the new country.
People may not foresee that patience and understanding are also needed in relation to travelers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting children's attractions in the region.
You can see the pyramids in darkness and you can see them in silence before the start of the show.
Here you will generally hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is just like a novel.
The sphinx is set in the background and it is the storyteller of a long story.
Scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are claimed by several countries, and they have the majority of bases, sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, on which the settlement Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Other islands are Livingston and Deception, whose flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a striking natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
United with the plateau here, the mountain range of the peninsula then reappears, forming the Ellsworth Mountains chain, which is 360 kilometers long and is intersected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel mountain range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak Vinson is 4,892 m high.
In extremely remote places without access to a mobile network, a satellite phone can be the only means.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, because one must be outdoors with a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure crafts, as well as expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider could further inform you about the connection to this service.
For those who plan a sabbatical year, it is increasingly popular to travel and study.
This is especially popular among those who finish secondary education, because it provides them with a free year before going to university, without risking their education.
In many cases, if you enroll in a gap year course abroad, it can actually improve your chances of advancing to higher education when you return to your home country.
Normally, there will be an enrollment fee to join these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent travel destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and on the lakes, one does not necessarily need a yacht.
Despite the fact that the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually quite large for any yacht, smaller boats and even a kayak provide a different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland: one in every seven or eight Finns owns a boat.
Such popularity is seen only in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand. But elsewhere it's quite a unique statistic (for example, in the Netherlands one in every forty people owns a boat).
The majority of the various Baltic cruise ships additionally include a stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can fully use a few days to visit the historic city, returning to the ship at night to sleep there.
If one disembarks only through the cruise ship excursions, a separate visa is not necessary (since 2009).
The brochures of some cruise ships include Berlin, in Germany. As can be seen above on the map, Berlin is not at all close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience regardless of age and background, especially if one has never flown or has experienced a traumatic event.
That is not a shameful matter: it is no different from personal fears and dislikes in other respects, which many people feel.
For some people, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear based on unfamiliarity or lack of control over the situation.
Courier companies earn good money for the fast delivery of items. Often, time is very important for business documents, goods, or replacement parts for urgent repair.
In some lines, the larger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem in other lines and smaller companies.
If they sent items by cargo plane, on some routes a few days might pass in the execution of unloading and customs.
The only way to accomplish this faster was to send things as registered packages. According to airline regulations, one cannot send a package without a related passenger, and here's your opportunity.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is to spend a very large wad of cash for the privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you instead).
However, that is not cheap: according to rough estimates, you can expect to pay up to four times the usual economy class fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
Generally, it is not worth the effort to search for discounts on business or first-class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain core group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of traveling quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in the east of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is recognized by no UN member state.
The economic ties were restarted between these two parts of Moldova, although political negotiations failed.
The most important religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, and vibrant commercial center, located by a vast gulf and surrounded by mountains.
Between the wide boulevards, the buildings with glass facades and the modern shopping centers, traditional roofs of red tiles, 18th-century bazaars, and old mosques and churches appear scattered, but the atmosphere of the city is more of Mediterranean Europe than of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and features an unusual octagonal church.
On some graves in the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
It is worth dedicating half an hour to a walk through the intriguing village.
In the north and easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners when Lord Byron praised its magnificent merits.
The bus line 403 from Scotturb regularly travels to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima, which is the site of the worldwide famous apparitions of Mary.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave and also a place with almost incalculable significance for an important part of the world's inhabitants.
Many men and women who survived their stay here still remain, and there are even more people who had loved ones who were killed or worked to death here, whether they were Jewish or not.
Please conduct yourself in the place with as much dignity, solemnity, and respect as it fully deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the place with marks or graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. More or less half of the residents prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most of the posts are only in Catalan, because the law declared it the first official language.
In any case, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other services.
In the metro, they make the regular announcements only in Catalan, but they announce the unplanned interruptions using an automatic system in many languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Residents of Paris have gained a reputation for being egocentric, unfriendly, and proud people.
This is often only an imprecise stereotype, but the best way to maintain smooth relations with Parisians is to behave as if one is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). That will greatly ease the journey.
The abrupt manners of Parisians will quickly evaporate if one shows basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park has abundant forests, mainly of beeches, spruces, and firs, and it presents a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The diversity of vegetarian communities is remarkably high due to the range of microclimates, varied terrains, and different altitudes.
The region is also home to extremely diverse animals and bird species.
There one can find rare fauna, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats, and capercaillies, in addition to many more common species.
During a visit to the monasteries, women must wear knee-length skirts and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries do indeed provide linens to women who arrive unprepared, but the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you if you bring your own linen, especially if it is brightly colored.
Similarly, men must wear knee-length shorts.
You can also borrow those from the storage at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable if you use these skirts. There is one size for all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and it uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple popular dinner, especially in the summer, is "pa amb oli": bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available additions, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Every noun, in addition to the word Sie meaning you, always begins with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs and objects.
It probably also facilitates reading, but writing becomes somewhat more complicated because it is necessary to know whether a verb or adjective is used in the nominalized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in the Italian language, because most of the words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Furthermore, one must definitely pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means cart.
The grammar of the Persian language is relatively easy and regular in most cases.
Therefore, reading this grammatical introduction would help you learn a lot of Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
It goes without saying that if one speaks a Romance language, it will make learning Portuguese easier.
But nevertheless, people who speak a little Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is so similar that it's not worth learning separately.
Generally, premodern observatories are outdated today, and they remain as museums or educational institutions.
Because at that time light pollution was not such a problem as it is today, they are generally located in cities or at universities, places more easily accessible than those where they have been built in modern times.
The most modern telescopes for research are huge facilities in remote locations under favorable atmospheric conditions.
Observing cherry blossoms, also known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where the plum blossom was the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor only for himself and other aristocrats around the imperial court.
Because plants look best in their natural environment, do not give in to the temptation to remove specimens, not even "just one".
If you visit a formally arranged garden, collecting “specimens” will also result in your expulsion without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place and very easy to explore. Upon arrival, you can buy almost anything there.
But nevertheless, because you will be in the "high tropics," only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to contend with the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
Additionally, there are a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional tomb site of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme on which to base vacations.
Thus, for example, it would be possible to visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, or go by cruise ship to interesting cities on the Danube or by boat along the Erie Canal.
Additionally, they specify routes of known roads for hiking and biking.
Christmas is among the most important holidays in Christianity. It celebrates the birthday of Jesus.
Unbelievers living in Christian countries or elsewhere in the world have adopted many of the traditions of this celebration.
Traditionally, people spend the Easter night sleepless in an outdoor place to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could be about a pre-Christian spring and fertility rite.
On the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, more traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil, and the congregations begin celebrating at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that initially arrived at the archipelago came either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance between the islands and the continent, mammals were unable to make such a journey, and thus the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since their arrival, humans have introduced many mammals to the Galapagos, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, meaning the sun will not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good chance to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be almost always dark.
You will also be able to enjoy the stars, as those regions are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is usually not a problem.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be accustomed to.
Suits are the normal work attire and colleagues address each other by family names or job titles.
Workplace harmony is most important, just as emphasis on group effort instead of praise for individual achievements.
Workers usually need to receive approval from their superiors for all decisions made, and they must follow instructions without question.
