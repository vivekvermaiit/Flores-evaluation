This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, but also provides details that are usually not obtainable from fossilized remains, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown on top, and underneath it was either pale or had carotenoid pigmentation.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs lack a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but still have other distinctive features — barbs and barbules — researchers have concluded that the rachis most likely appeared later through the evolutionary development of other distinctive features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation and display. Researchers have suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen features adult plumage, not chick down.
Researchers suggested that, despite this being the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen has the plumage of an adult individual rather than chick down.

They discovered that the Sun operates according to the same basic principles as other stars: it was established that the activity of all stars in the system is determined by their brightness, rotation, and nothing else.
The combination of luminosity and rotation is used to determine the Rossby number of a star, related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic field inversions.

The work carried out was mainly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations of the galaxy in Sagittarius.
The effect that the team was looking for may be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way affects the galaxy in Sagittarius.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way as with ordinary matter.
According to this theory, a significant portion of the dark matter around the Galaxy is arranged in the form of a halo and consists of a large number of small particles.

During research in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa, Dr. Tony Moll managed to discover tuberculosis with exceptionally high drug resistance (XDR-TB).
In the interview, he said that the new strain "is of great concern as it leads to a very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have been infected in the hospital, thinks Dr. Moll, and at least two were healthcare workers in the hospital.
In one year, an infected person can transmit the disease to 10 to 15 people through close contact.
However, the percentage of people with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the entire group of tuberculosis patients still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 infected at this particular moment in South Africa.

In France, voting is traditionally conducted using low-tech methods: the voter goes into a booth and places a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After election officials verify the voter's identity, they place the envelope in the ballot box and sign the voter list.
The laws of France on elections quite strictly systematize the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can ensure that at the beginning of voting there are no envelopes inside and that no envelopes are added except for those of people who are allowed to vote and whose ballots are properly counted.
Candidates can send their representatives to monitor the entire process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision according to a special procedure.

In addition to the competitions on Wednesday, Karpenko participated in two individual events at the championships.
Her first competition was the slalom, in the first run of which she did not reach the finish line. 36 out of 116 participants had the same result in that race.
In another race, this time in the giant slalom, she finished tenth among women in the sitting position with a combined time of 4:41.30. She was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place finisher, Austrian Claudia Lösch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female skiers in the women's sitting category were unable to finish their runs, and 45 out of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to place in the race.
The police of the state of Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya stated: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampuro Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused were brought before the judges with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the building at the moment when a car crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services were freeing the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Subsequently, the Edinburgh sheriff court charged Adekeye with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but any witness testimony may be distorted as her popularity has been widely used by the media.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of photographs as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to really walk a dangerous line by publishing photographs and other data about suspects."
The Royal Prosecution Service, which is generally responsible for prosecution, told journalists that no further comments will be made until at least a guilty verdict is delivered.
According to the information leak, the document will pertain to the dispute regarding the borders that Palestine wants to establish based on those that existed before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other topics reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PNA agrees to maintain such a presence for only five years.
The shooters participating in the additional pest control test had to be under the close supervision of rangers, as the test was conducted under observation and its effectiveness was evaluated.
Within the framework of the partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the Wildlife and National Parks Service, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation underwent comprehensive training and safety briefings.
Yesterday, Marteyi swore in a new Temporary Electoral Council (TEC) consisting of nine members.
This is Martelli's fifth SEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended that the previous Interim Electoral Council resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the mass protests against the state regime that began in October.
These protests, which were sometimes accompanied by violence, were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which should have taken place back in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of defective iPod devices were reported, resulting in six fires and four people sustaining minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 cases related to these devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Labor and Industry announced that Apple informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as "non-serious."
In response, the ministry called the delay of Apple's report "very regrettable."
At 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday), an earthquake occurred in Mariana.
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office stated that there have been no reports of damage.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman hijacked a tour bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza was firing his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead at the moment.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were freed earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the place of the elderly woman as she went to the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He was educated as an obstetrician-gynecologist and began working at the National Women’s Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When Liggins worked at the hospital, in his free time he began investigating cases of premature births.
His research showed that if the hormone is administered, it will accelerate the maturation of the child's lungs during fetal development.
As reported by Xinhua, on Wednesday, state investigators found two flight recorders, or "black boxes".
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Here is what Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. This is such a unique event, just like she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said: "The moon was as crazy as I am... Maybe even crazier... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal elections, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard expressed the opinion during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of respondents share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
The survey showed the following: 29 percent of respondents are sure that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that it does not need this form of government.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle races and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition is now in question.
He was unable to take the medications necessary for pain relief because they are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
On Tuesday, it was announced that by the beginning of February, several people had confirmed this discovery using various hardware and software.
Comets may have been the source of water delivery to Earth, as well as the source of organic substances that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo began his tenure as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called these rumors "political gossip and nonsense."
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system which, according to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, will allow aircraft to fly via shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and also reduce carbon emissions.
She uses satellite technology instead of old ground-based radar technology, which will allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the position of aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport has been scheduled to Wembley, surface trains will not stop there, and moreover, there are no parking or park-and-ride facilities available.
Concerns about the lack of transportation have led to the suggestion that the game may have to be held behind closed doors without fans.
In the description of the study published on Thursday in the journal Science, it is mentioned about the emergence of a new bird species on Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that due to the mating of the endemic Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortes) with the immigrant cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris), a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer.
Gold can be shaped into any form. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be braided and plated. It can be embossed or rolled into coils.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that sometimes it was used to embellish hand-painted illustrations in books – the so-called "illuminated manuscript."
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline a chemical substance is.
The pH level is determined by the degree of saturation with hydrogen ions (H in pH) of the chemical compound being studied.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been separated (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Obtain a new mixture by mixing two dry powders in one container, then use clean, damp hands to form a ball from this mixture.
Moisture on your hands will react with the top layer, which will be unusual, then a kind of shell will form.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Preserved fragments of sewage systems were found in the houses of Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away from you, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and almost instantly reflects it back down.
The satellite was delivered to space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere somewhat distorts our light and view.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is required.
The wheel has incredibly changed our world. The most important thing the wheel has done for us is to give us much easier and faster transportation.
It gave us a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
Under them are a greater number of medium-sized cats that eat smaller prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
And finally, many small cats (including roaming domestic cats) eat and hunt much more numerous small animals like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the concept of a niche, a special role that each species of cats plays, which keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three adult males who are related, as well as females and cubs, whose number can reach up to thirty.
Females are usually related to each other and make up a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs—animals that are astonishingly similar to lions in their habits (but not to other big cats) and are also very dangerous to their prey.
Being a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb trees (although not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that have the ability to roar.
A tiger's roar does not resemble the full-bodied roar of a lion, but rather sounds like the shouting of sentences composed of indistinct words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. If given the chance, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the creatures that ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow the trail of animals and find prey by scent, tracking its movements on the ground with their sense of smell.
They are excellent at seeing in the dark with the help of night vision and can move almost imperceptibly. Ocelots stalk their prey by blending into the surroundings and then pounce on their target.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they were previously in.
This new environment has different resources and other competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or changes compared to what it had before to become a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all — it still requires the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it starts to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Over time, in thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that it will not be possible to say that they are the same species.
We call this process speciation, that is, the emergence of new species. Speciation is a necessary consequence and an extremely essential part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants feed on sunlight through photosynthesis. Moreover, they cast a shadow.
We build our houses and make our clothes from plants. Most of our food is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The mosasaurus was the most formidable predator of its time, so it was afraid of no one but other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were lined with more than 70 of the sharpest teeth, plus there was an additional row on the palate, so there was no escape for those who crossed his path.
We do not know for certain, but it is not ruled out that his tongue was forked. He fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and might have been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the tyrannosaurus wouldn't compare to him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans still had their own strange and unusual dishes served during feasts. For example, boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
There was another difference: while the poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich liked to hold joint feasts during which they ate lying on their sides.
The diet of the ancient Romans could not include products that came to Europe from America or Asia in subsequent centuries.
In particular, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main sanctuary for each of the gods, which was considered the dwelling of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to please the desires of the gods at ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only priests could enter.
Sometimes special towers in the form of pyramids, called "ziggurats," were constructed as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not of particular significance.
Most of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
The women were cooking in the yard; the shops had open counters facing the street. Stone was used for building the houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Scandinavian sagas narrate that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, moving further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each of the countries was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, rulers, traditions, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have watched the movie "National Treasure," you might think that there was a treasure map depicted on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, it says: "This Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776." The text is written at the bottom of the document and upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence, this large parchment document (measuring 29¾ by 24½ inches) was rolled up for more convenient storage.
Thus, it is quite likely that the entry was added simply as a note.
As a result of Operation Neptune and the subsequent battles, the north of France was liberated, but the south was still not freed.
It was under the administration of the "Vichy" French. These French made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of resisting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the southern part of France. The invasion was named "Operation Dragoon."
In just 2 weeks, the Free French forces and Americans liberated southern France and headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a distinct culture whose carriers are a sufficiently large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin civilis, which means "civil" and is related to the Latin words civis, meaning "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state", and it also in a certain way expresses the size of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, continuous cultural presence, and acceptable dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and therefore cannot be recognized as true civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen states, in accordance with the Articles of Confederation, initially formed a weak central government whose sole body was the Congress.
The Congress lacked any authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on the state authorities, which often refused to cooperate and were unwilling to enforce all its acts.
He also did not have the authority to repeal state tax laws and tariffs.
To amend the articles, unanimous approval from all states is required, but the states were so irresponsible towards the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, alongside the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions. Residents of Italy from these regions participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
In Japan, there are approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to its membership in a cluster/group of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an archipelago.
Taiwan has its origins many years ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating the transformation of indigenous grain production methods and hiring Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding the rights to Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a more accurate idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still photographs in the world is 35 mm, and it was this size that dominated film at the sunset of the analog era.
Today it is still being produced, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sizes of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat misleading; it has a width of 36 mm and a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get a ratio with small whole numbers) is therefore taken as 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) are equal to or closely approximate these proportions.
An overly used and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a certain degree of order in the image.
It states that it is best to place the main subject at the intersection of lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, became the subject of close attention.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European states despite differences in languages and traditions.
Her all-pervasive power touched everyone - from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds exist precisely for this purpose.
The center of church power was based in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and wealth led many to doubt whether this dogma was being observed.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy proved its effectiveness by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated universally accepted international laws outlined in several international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sectors of the oceans, endangering even neutral ships.
Since the reaction to this tactic was restrained, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare activities.
Among the majority of citizens and nations in the 1920s, sentiments such as pacifism and isolation prevailed.
Having experienced the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the states wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America and accepted an offer to work at the Edison company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with four cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, who was his boss at his previous job, to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, a unique method was used to designate periods of time; each era of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Moreover, between the reigns of each dynasty, there was fragmentation and instability. The most famous was the Era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years during the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce military actions took place between many noble people fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest times in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for a place on the throne in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many such social and political effects as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, job opportunities became available to all men, which allowed the most ambitious and talented to achieve success.
The same applies to the army, because ranks began to be based on qualities rather than on origin.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed members of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in topics unrelated to worldly life. He often visited a cave, which became known as "Hira" on the mount "Nur" (light) for contemplation.
Well, the cave that has survived to this day gives us a very vivid idea of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave is situated atop a mountain to the north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is very difficult to detect her even for someone who knows of her existence. In the cave, a person finds themselves in complete isolation.
There is nothing visible except the clear beautiful sky above and the multitude of surrounding mountains. From the depths of the cave, only a very small part of this world can be seen and heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that exists today.
The Great Pyramid was erected by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the memory of the pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the Giza Necropolis, in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed in honor of Khufu's wives and his relatives.
The symbol for an upward bow stroke looks like a V, while a downward bow stroke appears as a bracket or a square missing the bottom side.
"Up" means you should start from the tip and move the bow forward, and "down" means you should start from where your hand holds the bow and move it backward.
The upward movement of the bow usually produces a softer sound, while the downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive one.
You can draw your own hatching, but remember that the hatching is printed for musical reasons and is usually worth following.
On October 6, 1789, an enraged crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and the king's sister Madame Élisabeth to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted threats at the king and queen.
The crowd of people made the King and Queen open the windows wide.
At one point, a member of this crowd waved the head of the royal guard, killed at Versailles before the eyes of the frightened queen.
The military expenses of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on bond loans issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking offices.
Of course, the superprofits gained from the long exploitation of the Filipinos constituted the main income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that prompted them to establish the order.
The era in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history encompassing the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted viewpoint, ended around 1500 AD.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from technical progress or the technological imperative to the strict viewpoint that people's destinies are driven by the underlying logic associated with the laws of science and their manifestation in technologies.
Most views on technological determinism share two common ideas: that the direction of technological development is practically immune to cultural or political influence, and that the "impact" of technology on society is determined by its own properties, rather than by society.
For example, one could say that the automobile is a necessary cause for the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is economically unviable for only a small group of vehicles, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in the number of traffic accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new methods of treating injuries in healthcare.
Romanticism largely included cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and culture related to it arose, which, being in harmony with the place of residence of a given society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople considered the fashion capital in the times of feudal Europe.
The fame of it as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
His status declined throughout the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders returned with such gifts as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in Byzantine markets.
At that moment, the title of the Fashion Capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th–11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West can lag by 25-30 years.
Distinctive styles began to develop in Western Europe by the end of the Middle Ages. One of the greatest achievements of that time, thanks to the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is farming that is conducted to produce sufficient quantities of food to satisfy the needs of only the farmer and his/her family.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic, system of agriculture that uses seeds from plants native to the given ecosystem, along with the application of crop rotation and other relatively simple methods to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in agriculture for subsistence, and this is still observed in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel oppressed by societal standards and allow such people to define for themselves who they are.
Differences between subcultures are possible, depending on the age, nationality, social status, place of residence, and/or gender of the people who comprise them.
Characteristics that define a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Representatives of a certain subculture often assert their identity through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is the illustration of several unfortunate cases where children, due to a lack of proper attention, unfortunate circumstances, or intentional abuse, did not interact with adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "feral" or "wild." Some feral children were isolated by people (usually their own parents). In some cases, such abandonment of their child was a result of the parents' rejection of their serious intellectual or physical disability.
Children living on the streets may have experienced severe forms of violence or trauma before running away or being abandoned.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some of them lived in the wild on their own.
If he is completely raised by animals instead of humans, the feral child exhibits habits (within physical limitations) that are almost entirely similar to those of the specific animal that raised him — for example, his fear or indifference towards people.
While project-based learning is supposed to be simpler and more interesting, scaffolding surpasses many technologies.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a form of assistance for those experiencing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is Clippy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding, which aids in learning, is integrated into the software and is designed to remind, explain, and ask questions about procedures that might be too difficult for the learner to handle alone.
Children are placed under guardianship for a variety of reasons, ranging from homelessness to abuse and even extortion.
Children should never grow up in an environment where upbringing, care, and education are not provided, yet they do.
We consider the foster care system safe for children.
Our foster care system should provide safe housing, loving guardians, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care must provide for all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communications.
Distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage approach and satisfaction.
Thus, the idea has been expressed that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivating factors for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "long-term contacts" were also identified by Amiee and McCord (1998) as new facets of motivation when they studied how people respond to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting micro-expressions—facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
In the article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks described how people who, due to brain damage, are unable to understand speech, can nevertheless correctly assess the speaker's sincerity.
According to his assumption, animals such as domestic dogs may possess similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research conducted in the twentieth century has shown that there are two types of genetic variability: latent and expressed.
A mutation introduces new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations between the two pools with each generation.
In the savanna, primates with a digestive system like that of humans find it difficult to meet their amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so will lead to serious consequences such as stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most accessible plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are poorly assimilated by primates like us unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, animal-derived food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also serves as a rich source of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
Taking all of the above into account, it is not surprising that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees in the savannah do to this day.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during regular sleep and going back to sleep after a short period (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done with the help of a relatively quiet alarm clock, to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biological rhythms include drinking large quantities of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to bed, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of a person's inner peace is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present in you. Every person is potentially given the chance to attain absolute peace and a sense of satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but was supplemented by the Mahayana path of love and numerous Indian yoga techniques.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
The kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) in Kundalini Yoga is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is considered the heart of Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and consciousness enlightenment is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war ended, contradictions regarding the system, process, and culture led to discord between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years. Real warfare was waged in it, using proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places around the world.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been breached, and the only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became irrelevant practically overnight when about 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after capturing the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to carry a large number of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of sailors traditionally involves ensuring the country's ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously hindering the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the company in the North Atlantic during World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using its submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany most likely would have been able to conquer Britain just like the other countries of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to have milk, wool, meat, and hides at hand.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often supervised by goat-herders, who were typically children or teenagers, similar to the more common activity of shepherding. These grazing methods are still used today.
Wagon roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although tram roads consisted merely of parallel wooden beams, they enabled horses to carry larger loads and at higher speeds than on the slightly rougher roads of that time.
Railway sleepers began to be used quite a long time ago to hold the rails in place. However, it later became clear that the tracks were more efficient with a strip of iron on top.
It became common practice, but the iron led to greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron appeared.
The first known form of transportation was moving on foot, people began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
For their Australopithecus ancestors, walking upright was not so habitual.
Bipedal specializations are found in the remains of australopithecines from the epoch 4.2–3.9 million years ago, though it is possible that Sahelanthropus was walking on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living with more care for the environment. We can become members of the ecological movement and even be activists to ease future suffering to some extent.
As a rule, it is like treating the symptoms. If we need not just a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problems and eliminate it.
It is quite obvious that the world has significantly changed under the influence of humanity's scientific and technological progress, and due to overpopulation and people's extravagant lifestyle, the problems have become more extensive.
After the Congress adopted it on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the print shop of John Dunlap.
150–200 copies were made overnight, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of this document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it to be read before his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
25 copies of Dunlap, known to date, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lived on to the present day. We call them birds.
They are often not regarded as dinosaurs because they have feathers and are capable of flying.
But there is still much to be said about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly, clawed legs, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, that is, 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary digits" or "bits" if using computer jargon.
Identifying oral poisoning can be difficult at first. Symptoms like vomiting are too general for a quick diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container with medicine or a toxic household chemical substance.
Read the label for specific first aid instructions in case of poisoning by this particular toxin.
The term "bug" is used formally by entomologists to denote a group of insects.
This concept originates from bedbugs known since ancient times, insects that are perfectly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both predatory insects and bed bugs are nest-dwelling species adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the USA, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been detected, making multiple sclerosis the leading neurological disease among young people and middle-aged individuals.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that twice as many women suffer from multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child does not align with their interests or the interests of their child.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
When adopting, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so another couple can take in the child.
The main goal of science is to determine how the world works by applying the scientific method. This method essentially underlies most scientific research.
He, however, is not the only one. Scientific research is also guided by experimentation (an experiment is a test used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions, and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on ancient texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
In all scientific matters, including psychology, the views of Aristotle were accepted.
As the knowledge of the Greek language deteriorated, the West found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often significantly depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely a reaction to external periodic stimuli, have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue autonomous cycling for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first to suggest that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their DNA into a bacterium using phages, i.e., viruses.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus and the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can cause a wide variety of outcomes, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected segment of genetic material, and whether the mutated cells are germ line cells.
Only mutations in germ line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere may lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is interesting for those who love to go out into nature to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
Examples of outdoor activities at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example could be visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the countryside to go to their workplaces, while those whose workplaces are in the places they just left pass by them.
In this active traffic flow, everyone is connected in one way or another with the transport system based on personal cars and supports it.
Currently, science indicates that the vast hydrocarbon economy has impacted one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is a member of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about these systems.
In developed countries, you can rarely hear such complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why are there so many complaints about the transportation systems, and why do they break down every day? Are the transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or are there more fundamental reasons for this?
The study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and their interaction with each other, is carried out within the framework of traffic flow research.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic intensity because it is impossible to predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers is often quite systematic; thus, traffic flows, on the whole, have some systematic nature and can be approximately described mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between three main quantities: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of railway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape from predators more easily, find food, and mates.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their bodies, which gives them an advantage.
This provides them with a greater number of secluded places where they can hide from predators.
Dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Many believed that he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It seems like a reasonable idea because we don't feel that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the amount of water compared to the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that sometimes reaches six miles.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of our planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. Thousands of small rivers flow into it.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed.
In the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians admired the monuments created by their predecessors more than a thousand years earlier.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, as well as the country with the smallest population.
In the Vatican, Italian is used in legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language for most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican citizens are Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because they can all be found in nature in their pure form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
They were similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also suggested that they transition into a new state to result in what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Such elements as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
It is also possible to make alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them can fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it appeared.
It's sad that when new ways of writing appeared, the pencil lost its former status and was used less frequently.
Nowadays, people type messages on computer screens, and they never have to deal with a pencil sharpener.
One can only guess what will happen to the keyboard with the emergence of more new technologies.
An atomic bomb operates on the principle that energy is required for many protons and neutrons to be in one nucleus.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Then the repeated splitting of the nucleus releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they tend to decay with little or no influence.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km under the oceans and 100 km under the continents.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner there. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding out what motivates people to act or might interest them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that accumulate internally as they grow up.
These theories address what motivates specific individuals to want to do what they do, and what in their environment drives them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories about content are "Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs" and "Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory of Motivation."
As a rule, two types of behavior may emerge when managers begin to lead people who were previously their equals in status. One extreme of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
Such managers find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary measures, evaluate work results, distribute responsibilities, and hold employees accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels that they must change everything the team has done and claim it as their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Such behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the other team members.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They are usually more autonomous than employees from traditional teams, as their teams can meet according to different time zones, which the local management may not always understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"Invisible Team" is a team of leaders to whom every participant is accountable. The Invisible Team sets standards for each participant.
Why do organizations go through the labor-intensive process of creating a learning organization? One of the goals of applying the concepts of learning organizations in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across all functional divisions of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the coordinated work of the organization to overcome the obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that will meet the client's interests.
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and experience accumulation.
Angel (2006) explains the "Continuum" approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of efficiency.
Neuroscience data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of consciousness. Thus, the field of research is narrowed, and it becomes much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen structures and processes of the brain.
This provides us with a large amount of data and materials for creating simulation models that help us understand the processes occurring in our consciousness.
Despite the fact that AI is firmly associated with science fiction, it constitutes a very important direction in computer science, studying the behavior and learning of machines and "imbuing" them with intelligence.
Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Here are some examples that can be given: control, planning and scheduling, responding to diagnoses and client inquiries, as well as facial, handwriting, and voice recognition.
Similar questions are highlighted in separate disciplines aimed at solving the problems we encounter in everyday life.
At present, AI systems are often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, being integrated into some software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are very important for any class. Very often, teachers want to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual tours. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or enjoy beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Posting a tour in virtual space for everyone to see is also a great way to refresh your memory of the tour and share the knowledge you gained with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the state capital, and each year this website is updated, but access to the old versions is still preserved—they serve as a commemorative album.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blogs using sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes due to the presence of an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author starts striving to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Moreover, by blogging, "students begin to better understand the world around them." Students are inspired to be intelligent and interesting, attracting the attention of readers (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and motivates students to extend the process of acquiring knowledge far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to online materials, students can determine their position in the context of others' work and also express their own views on specific issues (Oravek, 2002).
Ottawa is a delightful bilingual capital of Canada with a huge number of art galleries and museums that reveal Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, while the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and the surrounding areas.
All of this and much more makes Ontario truly Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
Large areas further to the north are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are practically uninhabited wilderness.
An amazing comparison of population numbers: there are more African Americans in the USA than citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than others and is a unique continent when it comes to wildlife.
Almost all of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as chic beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this region, which took root particularly in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The spread of European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route around the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: all female tourists are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that, due to cultural differences, it may seem to them that they are being harassed, often pursued, taken by the hand, and so on.
Firmly refuse men and do not be afraid to stand your ground (such behavior is unacceptable regardless of cultural differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. It was used as a strategic port by the Romans, Phoenicians, and Marinids and was called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt a city called Ed-Dar-el-Beida, and the Spanish traders, who established trading posts there, called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places selling such traditional Moroccan goods as tagines, pottery, leather products, hookahs, and a whole assortment of various trinkets, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets, especially the central part of the city.
Even though Goma is quite a safe place, it is advisable to check information in advance about any trips outside of Goma to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
This city is also a starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, and here you can also see mountain gorillas in the wild at one of the most affordable prices in Africa.
You can get to Goma on a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for an exotic faraway land.
Today Timbuktu is an impoverished city, but its reputation attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat from desert sands.
During the filming of Henry Louis Gates' program "Wonders of the African World" on PBS, one of the most important stops was made here.
This city is very different from other cities in the country, as it is predominantly Arabic in character rather than African.
Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa, along the border with Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern boundary is formed by the Crocodile River.
The area of the park is 19,500 km²; it includes 14 different ecozones, each of which is a habitat for various wild animals.
He is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered a leading one among the South African national parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there is a daily fee for the protection and visiting of this park.
It can also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows you to visit either selected national parks in South Africa or all of them.
The territory of Hong Kong was named after Hong Kong Island, a place that many tourists consider their main focus of attention.
The string of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline is compared to a sparkling bar chart, underlined by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the most picturesque places in Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the coast of the Kowloon Peninsula, which is opposite.
The largest part of the urban development areas on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land on the northern shore.
This is a place that the British colonizers took for themselves, and if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangrove forests, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps — they also include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which approximately one-third is covered with water or swamps.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is currently home to an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since interdistrict buses are often overcrowded, it is advisable to purchase a ticket several days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and reliable.
A minibus is a fast and convenient way to reach nearby places like Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The bridge across the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers reach a height of 83 meters, while the bridge itself is 378 meters long and has two lanes each 3.5 meters wide.
The clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017 when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area now occupied by eastern Paraguay; they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to various groups of local tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, which was previously referred to as the "enormous province of the East Indies," emerged as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to preserve much of its unique character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and also the best players in the world in a sport like polo.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be watched here at other times of the year.
To find out news about polo matches and where to buy tickets for them, visit the site of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to one British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on these islands, which is located in Port Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
As a rule, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands. In Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency might be; clarify in advance with the owners which method of payment is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, air temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity creates a sensation of colder weather compared to what the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons here: the amount of precipitation is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, nature is still wild, so you should not feed or disturb the animals.
The park administration warns: do not approach bears and wolves closer than 100 yards/meters, and all other wild animals closer than 25 yards/meters!
It doesn't matter how calm they look — bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain the necessary distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so respect their personal space.
Moreover, remember that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid cooking or carrying fragrant food, and also maintain cleanliness in the camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the bay.
All the ships sank, except for one British cruiser. Approximately 200 American and German sailors perished.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches here, as Auckland is situated on the shores of two harbors. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
Beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbor area) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and many are shady thanks to trees like pohutukawa.
In the central area of Auckland, where the prestigious residential suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers are located in Waitemata Harbour, the beaches of Tamaki Drive are spread out.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops located along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The most popular local beer is "Number One"; it has an uncomplicated, pleasant, and refreshing taste. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that can be drunk, however New Zealand and Australian wines may transport better.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you are still concerned, it is not difficult to find bottled water.
Australians don't understand the idea of a "flat white." A "short black" is an espresso, cappuccinos are served with a thick layer of whipped cream (not foam), and tea is without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although fruit juices are expensive, they are of excellent quality.
A large number of trips are made to the reef all year round, and injuries caused by any of these reasons on the reef are rare.
Still, follow the recommendations of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish can be found near beaches and river mouths north of 1770 from October to April. Sometimes they can be encountered outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not lead an active life in the ocean; their main habitat is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking allows the traveler not to worry about where to stay overnight upon arrival at the destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you can also book other forms of accommodation through a travel agent, such as campsites.
Travel agents typically sell package deals that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined packages that include flights and hotel accommodations.
Furthermore, they can hold the reservation if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for the destination (e.g., a visa).
Any changes or requests should first be sent to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees spend the night right on the festival grounds, and most of them consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be near the stage, you need to arrive early to find a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages may already be over, there can be areas at the festival where the music will continue to play until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, find out about the cabin location, as passing through ice causes quite a creepy noise that may disturb sleep for the most sensitive people.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include city tours. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (confirm the conditions).
Casinos usually make every effort to ensure that visitors spend as much time as possible and spend as much money as possible in the establishment. There are no windows or clocks, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment so that guests remain in a good mood and do not leave the establishment.
In some establishments, free alcohol is offered. However, intoxication clouds the mind, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Everyone who is going to travel in high-latitude areas or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or frosts.
On an icy and snowy road, the friction is low, and you won't be able to drive the car the same way as on regular asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow to get stuck can fall in a very short period of time.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall, blizzards, condensation, or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, weather conditions with snow and ice are normal in many countries, and road traffic continues year-round almost without interruption.
Safari is probably the biggest draw for tourists in Africa and the main event for many travelers.
The term "safari" in everyday use refers to an overland trip to view the remarkable wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, often approach cars, so you can get a good view even with regular equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes cautious, and you will observe them better through binoculars.
Walking safari (also referred to as "bush exploration", "hiking safari" or "walking tour") consists of a hike lasting from several hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will become the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice. They were first held here in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the date change was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies may vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-related policies do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a standard ticket price of about 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Many hotels provide an iron and ironing board for rent, even if they are not available in the room.
If there's no iron at hand or you're not thrilled with the idea of wearing ironed socks, you can try a hairdryer if you have one.
Do not expose the fabric to excessive heat (which can lead to shrinking or, in very rare cases, burning).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others it will take several minutes.
Filters are effective to varying degrees, and in case of doubt, you should consider buying water in sealed bottles from a trustworthy company.
Travelers may encounter pest animals that they have not seen in their native areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, worse, trigger allergic reactions, secrete poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, by themselves, or dangerous animals that can cause injury or lead to human death, are generally not considered pests.
Shopping "duty-free" is the opportunity to buy goods without taxes and duties at specific locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a significant amount, especially on items such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated, remote, and wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay alert: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns prevail.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on prior and subsequent sections—usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and strict compliance with them is even more important than anything else.
However, strangely enough, mobile phone reception here is much better than in many other sections of the route, such as in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German confectionery is quite good. In Bavaria, it is quite plentiful and diverse, and similar to the pastries of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apple pastries available year-round, while cherries and plums appear in the summer.
In German baking, almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts are often used. Popular cakes often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but hearty pastries, try what, depending on the region, is called oladyas or stuffed donuts.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the liquid content, curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior regions of Pakistan and Northern India, yogurt is actively used in curry. In Southern India and certain coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
Indonesian cuisine, with 17,000 islands to choose from, is a general term used to describe the vast variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But without further clarification, this term most often refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, includes a variety of simply seasoned dishes. The Javanese have a strong preference for flavor enhancers such as peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are foot supports for the rider, hanging on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but there may be safety issues, as there is a chance of the foot getting stuck.
If a horse throws off its rider and their foot gets caught in the stirrup, the running horse can drag them along. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with heels, which have smooth and fairly thin soles.
Moreover, some saddles, especially English ones, are equipped with safety bars, thanks to which the leather stirrup falls off the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamo Valley is the main climbing destination in Chile. It is known as the Yosemite of South America and has a large number of big granite walls and cliffs.
At the top, one can enjoy stunning mountain landscapes. Climbers from all over the world constantly create new routes in its vast potential for mountaineering.
Mountain winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending snowy terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Alpine skiing is the main tourist destination for many ski enthusiasts (sometimes called "ski bums") who plan their entire holiday around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The sport of alpine skiing dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring is also called backcountry, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related, but usually does not include hiking to the top and then descending on unprepared slopes, as skiing in untracked snow requires stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine that the ski route is a hiking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than when moving on foot, but you will only be able to achieve such speed on cross-country skis in extremely rare cases, when you do not have a heavy backpack and there is a groomed trail.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean having to apply for visas and going through passport control multiple times.
But the Schengen Area in this respect functions like a single country.
Being in this area, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control points again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen Agreement member countries separately, which will save you time and money, as well as avoid paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods that are over 100 years old as antiques.
This concept has geographical variations, where the age limit in places like North America may be lower than in Europe.
Craft items can be classified as antiques even though they are younger in age than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding this activity is also important for many other professions.
Although it was a tradition, not all Saami people engaged in large-scale reindeer herding; they lived by fishing, hunting, and other similar trades, using reindeer mainly as pack animals.
Today, many Sami are engaged in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region of Lapland.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is often considered offensive due to associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Romani people.
If there are travel advisories or warnings for the country you plan to visit, this may affect your travel medical insurance or your trip cancellation insurance.
Perhaps you should also consult with other governments besides your own, but their recommendations are aimed at their citizens.
Here is one example: U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face situations that Europeans or Arabs might not encounter.
The informational messages merely briefly describe the political situation in one country.
The expressed opinions are often superficial, vague, and overly simplified compared to more detailed information that is universally available.
Adverse weather conditions is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon capable of causing damage, serious social disruptions, or loss of human life.
Adverse weather conditions occur everywhere in the world, and they come in different types depending on geography, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy precipitation, and wildfires are manifestations and effects of severe weather phenomena such as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal hazardous weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to take into account any risks associated with severe weather in their area, as they may affect any travel plans.
All those who plan to visit a country that may be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
Searching the internet for the phrase "hostile environment safety course" may give you the address of a local company.
The course usually examines all the topics touched upon here in much greater detail, most often with practical training.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes situational role-playing, a large amount of first aid information, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that discuss survival in the wild are common, but there are few publications about combat zones.
People planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must make sure they have valid documents for the return journey.
The readiness of governments to issue passports without a gender marker (X) or documents updated with the desired name and gender varies in different places.
The readiness of foreign governments to fulfill their obligations under these documents varies significantly.
Screenings at checkpoints also became much more thorough after the events of September 11, 2001.
Transgender people preparing for surgery should not expect to pass through scanners without their privacy and dignity being affected.
A rip current is a current created by waves breaking on the shore, or sometimes on a reef or something similar.
The return flow is concentrated in a few deeper areas, where a rapid current can form, descending to a greater depth, due to similar underwater topology.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion while attempting to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back will be no harder than usual.
Try going somewhere you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether or not you've been spotted, you might want to wait for a rescue.
The shock upon returning to one's home country occurs earlier than cultural shock (there is a shorter romantic period here), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some habits of your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people were most likely patient and understanding towards you, knowing that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
It may be unexpected for people that patience and understanding must also be shown to travelers who have returned home.
The sound and light show set against the backdrop of the pyramid is one of the most exciting events in the area for children.
The pyramids can be seen in the dark, and you can also see them in the silence before the show begins.
Usually, there is always the noise of tourists and vendors. The history of sound and light is like a book of stories.
The Sphinx acts as a backdrop and storyteller of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries claim the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819. These islands have the most bases, and in 2020, sixteen were operational.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers from the peninsula. The largest island is named King George Island and is home to the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano to this day forms an impressive natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Antarctic Peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of this peninsula here merge with the plateau, and then rise again to form the 360-kilometer Ellsworth mountain range, divided by the Minnesota Glacier into two parts.
In the northern part, that is on the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains of Antarctica — the Vinson Massif, the highest point of which reaches 4,892 m and is called Vinson Peak.
In remote areas outside the range of mobile service, a satellite phone may be your only option.
As a rule, a satellite phone is not a replacement for a mobile phone because you need to be outdoors in direct line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including recreational and high-speed vessels, where there is a need for remote data transmission and voice communication.
As a rule, you can obtain additional information about connecting this service by contacting your local telephone operator.
An option that is becoming increasingly popular for those planning to take an academic year is to travel and study.
It is particularly popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a year off before entering university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during an academic leave can indeed enhance your chances of admission to higher education institutions in your home country.
As a rule, a tuition fee is charged when enrolling in such educational programs.
Finland is an excellent place for boating tourism. In the "land of a thousand lakes," there are also thousands of islands on the lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
Exploring archipelagos or visiting lakes, you can quite manage without a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes can indeed accommodate any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak leave completely different impressions.
Boating is a national form of leisure in Finland. In particular, there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
A similar situation exists in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but in other cases, it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands, this value ranges from one to forty).
Most individual Baltic cruises include an extended stopover in Russia's St. Petersburg.
This means that you can spend several full days in this historic city, and for the night - return to the ship.
If you go ashore only as part of a ship excursion, you won't need a separate visa (since 2009).
In some cruise brochures, Berlin, Germany is featured. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
A journey by plane can be frightening for a person of any age and social status, especially if it is their first flight in life or if they have had any traumatic event in the past.
There is no need to be ashamed of this: it is no different from personal dislike and fear of other things that many people have.
Understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear that arises from the unknown or the inability to control the process.
Delivery services are well paid for quick delivery execution. Often, the speed of delivery of commercial documentation, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs is very important.
On some routes, larger companies have their own airplanes, but for other routes and for smaller companies, this has been a problem.
If they shipped something as air cargo, on some routes unloading and customs clearance could take several days.
The only way to handle it faster is to send it as checked baggage. The airline's regulations do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, so your involvement is necessary here.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out for this privilege (or better yet, get your company to pay for you).
However, this is not cheap at all — based on experience, as a rough estimate, you will pay four times more than the usual economy class for business class and eleven times more for first class!
As a rule, there is no point in even looking for discounts on business or first class for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a tidy sum for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, which is why they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multinational republic that has fallen victim to an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million people, the largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna today is a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, situated along a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards and buildings with glass facades alternate with modern shopping centers and places with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, old mosques and churches, giving the city more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than that of traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldarsvík, there is a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and it also has an unusual octagonal church.
On the church cemetery, above some graves, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
It is worth spending half an hour and taking a walk through the unusual village.
Relatively not far to the north lies the romantic and charming town of Sintra, extolled by Lord Byron and subsequently gaining worldwide fame.
Scotturb bus № 403 operates regular trips to Sintra and stops at Cape Roca.
Further north, also visit the great Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (the burial place) — a site of the world-famous apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Please remember that you are essentially at the site of a mass grave, which is also an indescribably important place for a significant percentage of the Earth's inhabitants.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their stay here, but there are even more people whose loved ones were killed here or worked here to death, whether they were Jews or people of other nationalities.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust and Nazis.
Do not defile this place by drawing or scratching graffiti on the surrounding objects.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are indicated only in Catalan, as it is the first official language by law.
Nevertheless, the Spanish language is also widely used in public transportation and other public places.
Regular announcements in the subway are made only in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Even though it is often just a false stereotype, the best way to succeed in Paris is to conduct yourself impeccably, like a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) person. This will significantly ease your adaptation in this city.
The unwelcoming exterior of Parisians will immediately disappear if you show a little basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, mainly with beeches, spruces, and firs, and represents a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to the combination of microclimates, various soils, and altitude variations, it features an especially wide diversity of plant communities.
The area abounds with a vast variety of different species of animals and birds.
Here you can encounter rare representatives of the fauna, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, as well as many other common animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts below the knee and have their shoulders covered.
In most monasteries, they provide clothing to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also take them at the entrance, but this clothing is not washed after each use, so you may feel uncomfortable in these skirts. One size fits all men!
The cuisine of Mallorca, like the cuisines of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on vegetables, bread, and meat (especially pork), with the widespread use of olive oil.
A simple and popular lunch dish, especially in the summer, is Pa-amb-oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available toppings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, meaning You, are always capitalized even in the middle of a sentence.
It is important to distinguish between verbs and complements.
This also likely simplifies reading, while writing becomes somewhat more complicated by the necessity to determine whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
One should be especially careful with the letters c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Also, do not forget that r and rr are pronounced differently: caro means "dear," and carro means "cart."
The Persian language has relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this textbook on Persian grammar will help you learn a lot of new things and better understand expressions.
Obviously, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is quite similar and can be learned without studying it separately.
Ancient observatories are generally considered obsolete today and serve as museums or educational institutions.
Since light pollution was not as much of an issue during their heyday as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, which are easier to reach than those that are built in our time.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as "hanami," became part of Japanese culture as far back as the 8th century.
This idea came from China, where the favorite flower was the color of plum.
In Japan, the first celebrations of cherry blossom were organized by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural habitat, so don't give in to the temptation to take even a single specimen.
When visiting an officially organized garden, collecting "samples" will also result in you being kicked out without any discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place that's easy to navigate, and just about everything can be bought upon arrival.
However, finding yourself in the "deep tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to contend with both the heat (constantly) and the intense sun (on clear days, less frequently).
There are also several buses going north to Hebron — the legendary burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are about to take is going to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Internal waterways can be a great theme for hosting some kind of celebration.
For example, visiting the castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, taking a cruise along the sights of the Danube, or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also identify routes for popular walking and cycling paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night outdoors without going to sleep, to watch the sunrise.
Of course, this tradition has a Christian theological explanation, but it could quite possibly be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter service on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with parishioners usually starting the celebration of the Resurrection of Christ at midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived on these islands got here by swimming, flying, or were carried by the current.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals could not get there, which makes the giant tortoise the main herbivore on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of humans on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will learn what a polar night is, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This presents a good opportunity to see the northern lights because the sky will be more or less dark around the clock.
Since these areas are sparsely populated and, as a result, light pollution is often not an issue, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are accustomed to.
Suits are the standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is extremely important, and the results of group work are valued above individual achievements.
Usually, employees must obtain the supervisor's permission before making any decisions and are required to follow the supervisor's orders without question.
