This confirms the already established theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, while also providing data that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut-brown on the upper side and pastel or carotenoid-colored on the lower side.
The find also offers insight into the development of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, which we call a rachis, but do possess all other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – researchers have concluded that the rachis very likely evolved later in evolution than the other features.
From the structure of the feathers, it can be inferred that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, researchers believe that the specimen indicates this is adult plumage, not juvenile fluff.
Although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, according to researchers, the sample shows that it is the feather of an adult specimen and not the down of a juvenile.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate the observation of the constellation Sagittarius.
The effect that the team wanted to achieve would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just like the Moon attracts the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way also influences the constellation Sagittarius with its force.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in a similar way to ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around the galaxy is supposed to be concentrated around it in the form of a ring composed of numerous small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
In the interview, he said that the new variant "raises considerable concern and discomfort due to the exceptional mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the bacteria in the hospital, believes Dr. Moll, and at least two were healthcare workers in the hospital.
In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.

"They do not have such stable thermal properties as the large caves on Earth, which often maintain a more or less constant temperature, but these are adequate considering that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing, a member of the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Elections in France have always been low-tech: voters hide in individual booths and insert a pre-printed piece of paper with their marked choice into an envelope.
When the officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter deposits the envelope into the ballot box and signs the electoral register.
The French electoral legislation specifies this procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there is no envelope in them at the beginning of the election and that no other envelope has been added except those cast by properly registered and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe all parts of the procedure. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following certain procedures.

First, she competed in the slalom, where she earned the label Did Not Finish after the first run. In this race, the same result was achieved by 36 out of 116 competitors.
In her second race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting category with a total time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers in the women's sitting group did not finish their runs, and out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom, 45 failed to qualify for the competition.
Police in Madhya Pradesh have found a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five individuals who raped the Swiss woman, and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are said to be Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Senior Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the defendants came to court with covered faces.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
The driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed so that emergency services could free the driver from the red Audi TT.
First, he was hospitalized at the James Paget hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Later, the Edinburgh sheriff court charged Adekoya with the murder of her son.
She is awaiting an indictment and trial in custody, but eyewitness testimonies can be unreliable since her picture was published everywhere.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently, and the court judged that the publication of the photographs is potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee observes: "Journalists find themselves on thin ice if they publish photos of suspects and the like."
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is fully responsible for prosecution, indicated to journalists that it would not provide further comments at least until the indictment.
They revealed that the document will pertain to the border dispute which Palestine wishes to base on the pre-war borders that existed in the Middle East in 1967.
Other topics discussed are expected to include the future status of Jerusalem, which is considered sacred by both countries, and the issues concerning the Jordan River Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority has agreed to such a presence for only five years.
Shooters in the attempt to gain additional pest control were under the scrutiny of the guards, as the test is being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are obtained under the auspices of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the executive director for park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety guidelines and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday to the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission proposed the preliminary resignation of the Temporary Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country closer to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Protests, which are occasionally violent, were triggered by failed elections, some of which should have happened as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating non-functioning iPods were reported, leading to six fires and minor burns to four individuals.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that they were aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that it had been informed by Apple about an additional 34 overheating incidents, which the company labeled as "non-hazardous".
The ministry's response was that Apple's delay of the report is "truly regrettable."
Mariano experienced an earthquake at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office of Crisis Management of the Northern Mariana Islands said that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there were no signs of a tsunami.
Former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Some hostages have been rescued, and so far, at least six deaths have been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers confused an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a medical path.
He trained as an obstetrician and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth in his free time.
His research shows that in the case of hormone addition, the fetal lung development in the child accelerates.
According to Xinhua, government investigators found two "black boxes" of the plane on Wednesday.
The colleagues wrestlers also paid tribute to Luni.
"The moon was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Just as unique as she was. A strong woman," said Tommy Dreamer.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as bizarre as I am... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Among the 1,400 respondents before the federal elections in 2010, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The Prime Minister of the interim government, Julia Gillard, claimed during the federal election campaign in 2010 that in her opinion, Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
34 percent of survey participants agree with the demand that Queen Elizabeth II be the last monarch of Australia.
On one hand, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while on the other hand, 31 percent think that Australia should not become a republic at all.
The holder of the Olympic gold medal was supposed to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was questionable due to his issues.
He was not allowed to take the medication he needs for pain relief, as it is banned in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
The discovery, which was published on Tuesday, was confirmed by several people using different hardware and software by the beginning of February.
Comets could present a source that brought water and organic substances to Earth, from which proteins can form and that enable life.
Scientists hope to determine how planets form, especially how Earth was formed, as it has been a long time since comets collided with Earth.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month supported a bill to legalize same-sex marriages.
He described the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is anticipated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, thereby saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of old stationary radar-based technology, allowing air traffic controllers to determine the aircraft's location more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
They will not provide any additional transport and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley, parking lots and park-and-ride services on the surface are not available.
Due to fears of a lack of transport links, there is a possibility that the game will have to be played behind closed doors, without team supporters.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird has appeared in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from the American Princeton University and the Swedish Uppsala University reported a new species that developed through hybridization between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza fortis, in just two generations, although it was previously thought that this process took much longer.
Gold can be shaped into many different forms. It can be rolled into fine shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can also be forged or rolled into sheets.
It can be flattened very thinly and attached to other metals. Because it can be flattened so thinly, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
We call this pH chemistry. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of a chemical.
The pH value of the tested chemicals is determined by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (hydrogen atoms are actually composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix both powders and shape them into a ball with clean, damp hands.
Moisture on the palms will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and the formation of a kind of crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flushing toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of the sewage system were found in houses in Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women would meet in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then almost instantly bounces it back down.
The satellite was sent into space by rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
To transport a satellite or telescope into space, a huge rocket, more than 100 feet tall, is needed.
The bicycle has completely changed the world. One of its most notable contributions is faster and easier transportation.
It has brought us the train, the car, and many other forms of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
However, there are also many small cats (including feral domestic cats) that feed on much more numerous prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the niche concept, a special role held by each individual cat, protecting it from competition with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
In the pack, there are one to three males, who are related, and up to thirty females and young.
Like a large family of sisters and daughters, women are usually closely connected with each other.
A pride of lions behaves very similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions in behavior (but not to other big cats) and are also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete and can climb (although not very well), swim, leap long distances, and pull five times stronger than a strong person.
A tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four members of the big cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not as full and uniform as a lion's, but more chopped, growling, and shrieking.
Ocelots feed on small animals. Whenever possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals ocelots hunt are considerably smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and hunt animals for food (prey) using their sense of smell, as they can sniff where they have been on the ground.
Due to their night vision, they can see very well at night and also move silently. Eurasian lynxes hunt by blending in with their surroundings first, and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it migrates across a mountain range or river or moves to a new island and finds it difficult to return), it will often find itself in a different environment than it previously lived in.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to compete with them.
The original population has not changed in any way; they still need the same adaptations as before.
When a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, it gradually becomes less similar to the other population.
Over time, over thousands or even millions of years, the populations will become so different in appearance that they can no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that people expel from their lungs (or exhale).
Plants produce food through photosynthesis with the help of the sun. They also provide shade.
We use plants to make our houses and clothes. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Animals would not be able to survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaw contained more than 70 exceptionally sharp teeth, and he had additional teeth on the roof of his mouth, so he killed everything that crossed his path.
We do not have exact data, but he may have had a forked tongue. He fed on turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and he might even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked every creature that entered the water; even giant dinosaurs like tyrannosaurs were no match for him.
Although their food would mostly seem familiar to us, the Romans had quite a few strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women dined sitting on chairs, wealthy men preferred to enjoy their feasts together, reclining on their sides while dining.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tried turkey meat.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each god, which was supposed to represent the home of the individual god.
People brought offerings to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and celebrations.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary into which only priests could enter.
Sometimes they built special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats, which were part of the temples.
The top of the tower represented a special refuge for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
The life of the Hebrew family mostly unfolded outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were merely open counters facing the street. The houses were built from stone.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and discovered Greenland on his journey west, naming it Greenland.
However, regardless of his discovery, there were already tribes of Eskimos living there at that time.
Although Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences among their people, kings, customs, and history.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That's not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" were inscribed. The text is written at the bottom of the document, upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we do know that the large document on parchment (measuring 29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was stored in the form of a scroll at the beginning of its lifespan.
Therefore, it is possible that the bookmark was simply added as a tag.
With the D-Day landings and the battles that followed, they liberated northern France, while the south was still unliberated.
He was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1944, Allied forces occupied southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
The Americans and the Free French Forces liberated the south of France in just two weeks and turned toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of individuals who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil and is related to the Latin word civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which in some way also indicates the size of a society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. The culture of civilization involves the transmission of knowledge through generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and significant reach.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, and therefore cannot be regarded as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation – it was composed of only a congress.
The Congress did not have the power to impose duties, and because there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the state authorities to enforce its laws, which often refused to cooperate.
Moreover, he had no authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between countries.
To amend the articles, the consent of all federal states was required, but individual federal states did not take the central authority seriously, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, and in 2006 it became the world champion in football.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, hockey, inline hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern provinces, where Italians compete in international and Olympic games.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Due to the collection/group of islands that Japan has, from a geographical standpoint, it is often called an "archipelago."
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by the island named it Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began transforming indigenous methods of grain cultivation and employing Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the military forces of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coasts and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, the Qing dynasty government, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, transferring control over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to make it easier for tourists to imagine how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most widespread photographic format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still in use today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has also been adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format actually – and somewhat unusually – measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divide by twelve to obtain the most basic ratio in whole number form) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (ASP family of formats) are the same or very close to this height-to-width ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often exploited and frequently mocked, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while simultaneously providing a measure for organizing an image.
According to it, the most effective place for the main subject should be at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church came under scrutiny, having enriched itself and expanded its power.
Christianity united European countries for over a millennium despite differences in language and customs.
Her omnipresent power influenced both kings and common people.
One of the main Christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources are intended precisely for this purpose.
The seat of the central authority of the church has been based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to doubt whether it truly follows this principle.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain established a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy by which they disrupted the most important military and civilian supply proved effective, but this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom mined international waters to prevent ships from accessing entire areas of the ocean, thereby also endangering neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the dominant viewpoints of the majority of citizens and nations.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States, where he took a job with the Edison Company in New York.
When he arrived in the USA, he had only 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (manager at his previous job), addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China portrayed different time periods in a special way; each stage of China or each family in power was a recognizable dynasty.
Between individual dynasties, there was also an unstable period when the provinces were divided. Among these periods, the most well-known is the period of the Three Kingdoms between the Han and Jin dynasties, which lasted 60 years.
During these periods, fierce battles took place among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest times in the history of ancient China, as thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest seat in the great palace of the city of Xian.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
In addition, after the revolution, professions were open to all male seekers, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
This also applies to the military, as military ranks are now based on caliber instead of class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed members of the working class from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohamed was extremely interested in things beyond this earthly life. He visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain "Nur" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, provides a very clear idea of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave, located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if we know it exists. However, the interior of the cave offers complete solitude.
Except for the clear, beautiful sky overhead and the many surrounding mountains, nothing else can be seen. From inside the cave, little of this world can be seen or heard.
Of the Seven Wonders, only the Great Pyramid of Giza remains today.
The Great Pyramid, which the Egyptians built in the third century BC, is one of the many larger pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
On the Giza Plateau or in the "necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, while numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The symbol for "turn up" looks like the letter V, while "turn down" looks like a paperclip or a square without the bottom side.
Up means that you should start at the top of the bow and push it, down means that you should start at the frog (i.e., where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
The upward stroke of the bow typically creates a softer sound, while the downward stroke is stronger and more decisive.
If you wish, you can outline your bow markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed bow markings are provided for the music, so they should still be considered.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by an angry crowd of market women to retreat from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They were returning to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to throw open the windows of the carriage.
At one point, someone in the crowd waved the head of a royal guard, killed in Versailles, in front of the frightened queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the costs and interest for the bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the breakneck profits stemming from the prolonged exploitation of Filipinos would constitute fundamental income for U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context in which they were created.
The era in which these events took place is generally known as the High Middle Ages, which marks the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
Before the High Middle Ages was the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices, from technological pursuit or necessity to the idea that human destiny is driven by the fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share the same general ideas: that the development of technology follows a path strongly influenced by culture and politics, and that technology consequently causes "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we could say that with the development of the car, roads will certainly also develop.
However, the national road network cannot be economically justified for just a few cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which results in the invention of new techniques in healthcare for treating injured bodies.
Cultural determinism, drawing from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel, was an important element of Romanticism.
In the case of romance, individuals were shaped by geographical affiliation, and over time customs and culture associated with specific geographical areas emerged, which were in harmony with the state of society and thus better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just like Paris is famous today as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His reputation, which labeled him as the center of luxury, was established around the year 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
His status somewhat declined in the twelfth century because the Crusaders returned home full of gifts in the form of silk and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine market offered.
During this time, the title of fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At the beginning, the dress in the east had a strong touch of Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication links, the styles in the west may have lagged 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, in Western Europe, they began to develop their own style. One of the greatest advancements of that time and a result of the Crusades was that buttons began to be used for fastening clothes.
Subsistence farming is a term used for agriculture aimed at producing sufficient quantities of food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Self-sufficient farming is a simple, often organic system that uses saved seeds originating from the same ecological region, combined with crop rotation or another simple technique to ensure the best possible harvest.
In the past, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this remains true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal standards and allow them to develop their own identity.
Subcultures can differ based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
Characteristics that make a subculture recognizable can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often demonstrate their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behavior, and jargon.
One of the most commonly used ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on some unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during their upbringing due to neglect, unfortunate circumstances, or deliberate abuse.
Such children are called "wolf" or wild children. Some wolf children were locked away by people (usually their parents); this form of child abuse was in some cases the result of parents rejecting the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Before they were abandoned or ran away, feral children may have been subjected to severe abuse or trauma in childhood.
Others were supposedly raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild themselves.
When wild children are completely raised by non-human animals, their behavior (within physical limitations) is almost entirely identical to that of their animal caretakers, for example, fear or indifference toward humans.
Project-based learning should indeed be easier and more interesting, but stepping on stage goes a step further.
Coaching is not a teaching method, but rather support that provides assistance to individuals learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Stages can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of stage, but this also applies to the little paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual stages are an integral part of the software and are supposed to ask questions, encourage, and explain processes that might be too challenging for the student themselves.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, loving, and nurturing, yet it still happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the essential necessities of life that they did not have in the home from which they were previously removed.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet enable new dimensions in terms of usage and approach to rewarding.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are supposed to be important motivators for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new aspects of motivation when studying how audiences respond to websites.
Recording videos has enabled significant discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
They say in particular that with correct interpretation of micro-expressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks explained in his article The President's Speech that people who cannot understand speech due to brain injury are still capable of accurately assessing sincerity.
It even assumes that animals such as domestic dogs have such abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research from the twentieth century shows that there are two sets of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination with each generation redistribute variations back and forth between two sets.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of a human finds it difficult to meet amino acid needs with the plant resources available in the savanna.
Additionally, if this need cannot be met, serious consequences ensue: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily accessible plant sources would be proteins present in leaves and legumes, which are, however, difficult for primates, including us, to digest unless cooked.
On the other hand, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also a source of high-quality proteins containing all essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a somewhat similar way to how chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
Sleep interruption is a process during which you intentionally wake up during your usual sleep time and then go back to sleep soon after (after 10 to 60 minutes).
You can do this with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will rouse you but not wake you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room and force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, which is a known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces a person to get up and go to the bathroom.
The amount of inner peace in an individual is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in the individual's body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present is. Every person has the potential to achieve absolute peace and satisfaction.
Enlightenment can be achieved by anyone. The only obstacle on the way to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it also looks towards the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is essentially very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of unconditional love.
Kundalini yoga with yogic postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations enables the awakening of kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment).
Central Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Since Germany was a common enemy during World War II, the USSR and the USA began to cooperate. After the war ended, systemic, procedural, and cultural differences led to a rift between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and they truly fought, with the help of proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defenses had already been broken, and the only hope was retreat and redeployment at the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans became practically obsolete overnight when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army marched in and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the occupation of the eastern Polish regions, which was in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transporting goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional task of navies was to ensure that the country retains the ability to move people and goods while limiting the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One such recent example, most noteworthy, was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. To aid Britain, the Americans attempted to bring men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German navy primarily wanted to stop such traffic with U-boats.
If the Allied forces had failed, Germany would likely have managed to seize Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were mostly in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, and they were often tended by goat herders, who were frequently children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known sheep herders. These methods of managing herds are still in use today.
Railways had already been constructed in England in the 16th century.
Although the tracks for the wagons were made only of parallel planks, because of them, the horses that pulled them could achieve higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat inferior roads of the time.
Fairly soon, they began using sleepers to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, they discovered that the tracks are more efficient if they have an iron strip on top.
This has become a widespread practice, but the iron caused the wooden wheels on the wagons to wear out faster.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first tracks, entirely made of iron, were introduced.
Walking was the first known means of transport; humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (or upright man).
Their ancestor Australopithecus usually did not walk upright.
The characteristics of bipedal walking are present in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2–3.9 million years ago, but the hominid Sahelanthropus could have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
Our lives can become more environmentally friendly, we can join the movement for environmental protection, we can even become activists to reduce suffering in the future to some extent.
In many cases, this is similar to symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
It is entirely obvious that the world has changed enormously due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, but problems have also increased due to overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle of humans.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few streets away to the printing office of John Dunlap.
During the night, they produced between 150 and 200 copies, known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The document was read publicly for the first time by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
There are still 25 Dunlap broadsides considered the oldest surviving copies of this document, as the handwritten original has not been preserved.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many people do not perceive them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
Still, birds share many similarities with dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
Virtually all computers we use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, these two digits are called binary digits – or bits, if we use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always the most obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The main sign indicating possible internal poisoning is the presence of open packaging of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label to see if specific first aid instructions are listed for this poison.
Entomologists officially use the term insects for this group of insects.
This expression originates from a prehistoric kinship with mites, highly evolved human parasites.
Both robber bugs and mites are nesting animals that are adapted to living in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, specifically the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
The couple can decide that caring for the child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the role of the child's parents can be taken over by another couple.
The main goal of science is to determine how the world works using the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
But that's not all; an important part of scientific research also includes testing, where the test is aimed at eliminating one or more possible hypotheses, posing questions, and observing.
Naturalists and philosophers dedicated themselves to classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views have been established in all fields of science, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the Western world cut itself off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The majority of observed rhythms in psychology and behavior are often significantly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their formation through biological clocks.
Repeating rhythms that are not merely responses to periodic external stimuli have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue periods of uninterrupted cyclical repetitions even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main clues that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into the bacterium using phages or viruses.
They conducted two experiments where they labeled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of mutations can be very varied, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether germ cells are affected.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while elsewhere mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the beauty of the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Field activities include, among others, hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
Such an example is observing, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small rural towns in cars to reach their workplaces, while those working in the place they just left pass by them.
In this dynamic means of transport, everyone is somehow connected with the transportation system based on personal cars and also supports it.
Science now shows that the massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that have supported human evolution over the past two million years.
In society, everyone participates and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why are there so many complaints about transportation systems, why do they fail every day? Is it the incompetence of traffic engineers to blame? Or is it perhaps something more fundamental?
The study of traffic flow is the examination of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers is generally to some extent consistent, so traffic flows are also consistent and can be roughly represented in a mathematical form.
To better illustrate traffic flow, the relationships between the three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These ratios help in the planning, design, and operation of roadways.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Because of their ability to fly, they more skillfully avoided enemies and more effectively searched for food and mating partners.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them even more opportunities to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings against their bodies are dragonflies and mayflies.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought that he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
This seems reasonable, as we don't feel that the Earth is moving, or do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and simultaneously the largest river on Earth. It contains more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon, with parts as wide as six miles, is also the widest river on Earth.
As much as 20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river, the Amazon, is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. Thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Although the construction of pyramids with stones continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size of the pyramids in Giza and the technical expertise of their construction were never surpassed.
During the period of the New Kingdom, the Egyptians admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were already more than a thousand years old at that time.
The Vatican has approximately 800 residents. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
In Vatican City, legislation and official communication are in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most workers in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as all of them can be found in their original form in nature and can be fairly easily extracted with simple tools.
Philosopher Aristotle formulated the theory that everything is composed of a mixture of four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
In essence, there were more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he claimed that they transform into new substances and form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter. All matter is made up of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that you could fit trillions of them into the dot at the end of this sentence.
Thus, upon its invention, the pencil was a dear friend to many.
Unfortunately, new writing methods have emerged, and the pencil has been pushed aside.
People now write messages on computer screens and don't even come close to a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer emerges.
A fission bomb works by requiring energy to combine the nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart uphill. Part of this energy is then released by nuclear fission.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they usually decay on their own or with very little assistance.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
On the near side, the crust is about 70 km thick, while on the far side, it is 100 km thick.
It is thinner under the seas, but thicker under the highlands.
More seas might be on the near side because the crust is thinner. Lava rose to the surface more easily.
Theories about content focus on finding what drives people forward or what pleases them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize as they grow up.
These theories investigate what causes certain people to desire the things they want, and which things in the environment will motivate them to either do certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor motivational theory.
When directors start leading their former colleagues, it is generally believed that they can begin to behave in one of two ways. On one hand, there is the effort to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
Such a leader finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, enforce disciplinary measures, evaluate worker performance, assign tasks, and demand accountability for mistakes made.
On the other hand, we can turn into an unrecognizable individual who thinks that they need to change everything the team has been doing and chart the course in their own way.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success and failure of the group.
Such behavior often creates gaps between leaders and other team members.
Virtual groups strive for the same standards of excellence as conventional groups, yet there are small differences.
Virtual members of the group often act as a point of contact for their direct physical group.
Usually, they have more freedom than ordinary group members because their groups have to adapt to multiple time zones, which their local management sometimes lacks understanding for.
Another characteristic component of a virtual group is the presence of a true "invisible group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989: 109).
The "Invisible Team" is the management team to which individual members report. The Invisible Team sets standards for each member individually.
Why would an organization subject itself to the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? Among other things, the application of organizational learning concepts in practice is aimed at innovation.
When the operating departments of an organization effectively utilize available resources, creativity and ingenuity can begin.
Thus, within the process of collaboration inside the organization aimed at overcoming obstacles, a new innovative procedure can emerge that will meet the needs of the customers.
Before a certain organization can become innovative, the leadership must establish an innovative environment and promote shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuity approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive research. Thus, they narrow the research field and significantly increase its accuracy.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the hypotheses in researchers' studies.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before.
With this, we gain a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand how processes unfold in our minds.
Even though artificial intelligence has a strong connotation of science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and client inquiries, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
The mentioned things have become separate industries, focusing on providing solutions for real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it is integrated into numerous software applications for personal computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every class. Teachers would often gladly take students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution by carrying out virtual tours. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire art right in the classroom.
Publishing the excursion report online is also an excellent way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the nation's capital every year, redesign the website every year, but old versions remain online and serve as a memory album.
Blogs can help students improve their writing style. Although most students start writing a blog with superficial grammar and spelling, this usually changes with the presence of an audience.
Because students can often be the most demanding audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Moreover, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to capture the interest of the audience inspires students to want to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages student collaboration and effort to learn even when they are not at school.
Proper use of online journals "can encourage students to think more analytically and critically; by continuously responding to online material, students can determine their position relative to others' entries and develop their perspective on certain topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital of Canada, boasting numerous art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
A little further south are the Niagara Falls, while to the north we find the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka with its hinterland.
All this and much more puts the landscape of Ontario in the spotlight as something considered typically Canadian among foreigners.
Extensive areas further to the north are quite sparsely populated, with some areas being almost uninhabited wilderness.
The comparison of populations seems surprising to many: there are more African Americans living in the USA than citizens in Canada.
The East African islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and most distinct continent when considering its animal and plant life.
Smaller islands are mostly independent countries or associated with France and known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this territory, which became strongly established in the Comoros and the island of Mayotte.
The beginning of European influence and colonization dates back to the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a route from Europe to India around Africa.
The region in the north borders the Sahel, and in the south and west, it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: we recommend all female travelers to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps if you wear a ring (but not one that looks very valuable by appearance).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can create the impression of harassment, and it is not unusual for them to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Decisively reject men and do not be afraid to defend your position (this is not acceptable, regardless of cultural differences).
Modern Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinids under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, and then abandoned it after the earthquake in 1755.
The city was rebuilt by the Moroccan sultan as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in the whole of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is not difficult to find places that sell traditional Moroccan delights such as tagine, pottery and leather products, water pipes, and a wide range of trinkets, but all of this is aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets and especially the city center.
Although Goma is safe enough, trips outside Goma need to be explored to understand the conflicts ongoing in North Kivu province.
This town is also a starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the most affordable opportunities for tracking mountain gorillas in Africa.
After Goma, you can travel by bodo-bodo (motorbike taxi). For a short ride at the usual (local) price, you will spend about 500 Congolese francs.
Because it is also quite hard to reach, "Timbuktu" is used as another name for exotic, distant lands.
Although it is a tourist attraction due to its reputation and has an airport, Timbuktu is a poverty-stricken city today.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage due to the threat of desert sand.
He was one of the main stops of PBS's special broadcast of Henry Louis Gates's "Wonders of the African World."
This city is completely different from other cities in the country, as it has more of an Arabic vibe than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting a different group of wildlife and plant life.
It is one of the biggest attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
A daily entrance fee must be paid to preserve nature and visit the park, just like in any South African national park.
It might be a bad idea to buy the Wild Card pass, which provides access to selected parks in South Africa or to all the South African national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island and is a major destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings forming the silhouette of the city of Hong Kong are connected by a shimmering column chart, highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Urban development on the Hong Kong islands is largely concentrated on the reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This town was claimed by British colonialists as their own, so it is a good starting point for exploring the remnants of the colonial past in this area, if that interests you.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But these forests are not just mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last surviving remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², about one third of which is covered by water/swamp areas.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 chitals in the area.
Buses run from the intercity bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, most of them, especially those going east to Djaka and Bumthang, from 6:30 to 7:30.
Because intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts offer small Japanese minibuses that are comfortable and sturdy.
By using shared taxis, you can travel quickly and comfortably to nearby cities, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the town of Oiapoque in Brazil with the town of Saint Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The towers are 83 meters tall, measure 378 meters in length, and have two passages that are 3.5 meters wide.
The bridge stands 15 meters high. It was built in August 2011, but it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge was set to start operating in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints were also expected to be completed.
The Guarani, who lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also engaged in subsistence farming, were the most important indigenous group that inhabited the territory of what is now eastern Paraguay.
Other groups of indigenous tribes, such as Guaycurú and Payaguá, lived in the Chaco region and made their living through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, sometimes also called the "great Indian province," developed in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous natives.
The Spaniards began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its own character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
You can watch smaller tournaments and matches throughout the year.
News about tournaments and information on purchasing tickets for polo matches can be found at Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), and its value is set equivalently to the value of the British pound (GBP).
Cash can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
They accept British pounds on practically all the islands, and in Stanley, they mostly accept credit cards and US dollars as well.
On the outer islands, credit cards may not be accepted, but British and American currency might be; check with the owners in advance to find out which method of payment is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange your cash before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; in the summer, temperatures often exceed +30 °C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but a mix of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no special "rainy" and "dry" periods: the amount of rain is almost the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to the presence of humans, wild animals are still wild, and therefore should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park management, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife.
Bison, Canadian elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack, no matter how tame they may seem.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so leave them alone.
Moreover, you should know that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so do not carry or cook strongly scented food and maintain cleanliness in the campsite.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was established in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval showdown in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggles for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful march in the town ended with the killing of the high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland spans two harbors, there are many shores here. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches in North Shore (in the district of North Harbour) lie along the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are mostly sandy and safe for swimming and are usually dotted with New Zealand Christmas trees, pohutukawa, which provide shade.
The coastal stretch of Tamaki Drive is located in Waitemata Harbour, in the prestigious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches, which can sometimes be crowded, with a good selection of shops surrounding the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not complex, but a pleasant and refreshing beer. The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can enjoy various French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines are likely to withstand the journey better.
The tap water there is safe to drink, but it is not hard to find bottled water if you are concerned.
Australians perceive "coffee with milk" as something foreign. A short black coffee is an "espresso", a cappuccino is served with a generous amount of cream (not frothed milk), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Throughout the year, many hikers set out for the ridge, but there are few injuries on the ridge that would arise from any of these causes.
However, please follow the authorities' instructions, respect all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Sea jellies come close to beaches and river mouths from October to April, north of 1770. Occasionally, they can also be observed outside this time frame.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
While saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean, their primary habitat is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, the traveler ensures that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at the chosen destination.
Travel agents often have contracts with certain hotels, but through a travel agent, you can also book other types of accommodations, such as camping.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need to consider the offer or obtain additional documents for your target destination (e.g., a visa).
However, all adjustments and requests must first be communicated to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most attendees consider it a key part of the experience.
If you want to be at the center of the action, you have to get there early to secure a camping spot close to the music.
Although the music on the main stages might fall silent, it is worth noting that at certain festival venues, music can play late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check where the cabin is located, as breaking through the ice causes quite a terrifying sound for those most sensitive.
Cruises from Saint Petersburg include a stop in the city. Passengers on the cruise are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to ensure guests spend as much time and money as possible. There are typically no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
Their offer usually includes food, drinks, and entertainment acts to amuse visitors and keep them there as long as possible.
At some locations, alcoholic beverages are included in the price. However, being intoxicated affects judgment, and good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who will drive at high altitudes or over mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or subfreezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the grip is poor, and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time to leave you trapped.
Visibility may also be limited due to snow or snow carried by the wind, or due to condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are quite common in many countries, and traffic generally flows smoothly throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in everyday use means a land journey where we observe African wildlife, primarily in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach cars and can be easily viewed with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you will more easily see them with binoculars.
Walking safari (also called "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "trekking") refers to a hike that can last from a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events were held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympic Games twice, the first being in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement, you may be in a difficult position.
Cancellation policies vary, but most cancellation policies concerning the coronavirus from the end of March do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games are supposed to take place.
According to expectations, most tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, while regular tickets will cost approximately 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes dries them faster. Many hotels lend irons and ironing boards if they are not already present in the room.
If you don't have an iron handy or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can use a hair dryer if you have one.
Make sure that the fabric does not overheat (which can cause it to shrink or even scorch).
There are several methods of water purification, among which some are more effective against certain dangers.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil the water for one minute, while in other areas, it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have concerns, it's better to buy water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause hypersensitivity, or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, emit toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person with force are usually not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an option for purchasing goods that are exempt from tax and excise at certain locations.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont represents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo – Pittsburgh highway, as it frequently crosses isolated forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on gravel roads, be careful, as steep slopes, narrow paths, and sharp bends prevail.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and later sections, usually from 35 to 40 miles per hour (56–64 km/h), and strictly adhering to the limits is even more important than usual.
Oddly enough, the mobile signal here is much stronger than in many other sections of the route, e.g., in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and diverse, similar to those of their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are quite common, as cooked apples in pastries can be found throughout the year, while cherries and plums come into play in the summer.
For most German pastries, almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts are also characteristic. Popular cakes are usually especially enjoyable with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a pastry that's small but rich, try something that, depending on the region, is called a Berlin donut, pancakes, or donut.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of this subcontinent, coconut milk is typically used.
Indonesian food is a general term for the wide variety of local dishes found throughout the country, which offers as many as 17,000 islands.
However, the term without additional markers mostly refers to food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widespread throughout the archipelago, is characterized by a variety of simply spiced dishes, with the predominant flavors beloved by the Javanese being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups support the rider's feet and hang on each side of the saddle.
They offer the rider greater stability, but they can also pose a safety issue, as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a horse throws its rider off and the rider's foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse could drag the rider along in the event of an escape. To reduce this risk, several safety measures can be considered.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety latches that allow the leather stirrup to come off the saddle if the rider pulls it back during a fall.
Cochamó Valley – a leading climbing destination in Chile with diverse large granite walls and cliffs, known as the Yosemite of South America.
The ridges' peaks offer breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world continue to establish new routes on its walls with endless potential.
Snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving descending snowy terrain with skis or a board attached to the feet.
Skiing is the main activity for travelers with numerous followers, who are sometimes called "roving skiers" because they plan their entire vacation around skiing at a specific location.
The concept of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also called ski touring or ski mountaineering.
Although it does not usually contain elements of these disciplines, it is similar to alpine touring skiing or hiking, which are performed on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine a ski trail as being similar to a hiking trail.
In good weather conditions, you will be able to cover greater distances than by walking – but you will rarely achieve the speed of ski touring without a heavy backpack and groomed tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to apply for a visa multiple times and undergo passport checks.
However, in this regard, the Schengen Area functions somewhat like a single country.
Within this area, you can cross borders without having to go through checkpoints again, where you would have to show your passport.
If you have a Schengen visa, you also do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen area member state separately, which saves you time, money, and paperwork.
A universal definition that would determine which products are antiques does not exist. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition varies by geographical region, as the age limit may be lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Products of domestic crafts could be defined as antique objects, even though they are younger than similar goods from mass production.
Reindeer herding is an important source of income for the Sámi, and the culture in which this industry is embedded is also significant for other professions.
However, traditionally not all Sami herded reindeer on a large scale, but subsisted on fishing, hunting, and the like, with reindeer being primarily used for sledding.
Today, many Sámi work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sápmi region, the area of the Sámi people.
Although the word "Gypsy" is often used, especially among non-Roma, it is frequently understood as offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to travel advisories, it may affect your health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You might also want to consult a government other than your own, but whose advice is tailored for its citizens.
For American citizens, the situation in the Middle East will, for example, be different than for Europeans or Arabs.
The recommendations are merely a brief summary of the political situation in each country.
The views presented are often superficial, generalized, and simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather conditions are a general term for all hazardous weather phenomena that can cause damage, serious disruption to society, or loss of human life.
Extraordinary weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and we know of several different types that depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Forms and consequences of extreme weather conditions include strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and forest fires, as well as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather storms include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of any potential severe weather conditions in the area, as these may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should obtain professional training.
If you search the internet for a "hostile environment course," you will most likely obtain the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the problems mentioned here in much more detail, usually along with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2–5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid procedures, and occasionally also training for handling weapons.
Books and magazines about survival in nature are widespread, but publications about war zones are just a handful.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for the return journey.
Not all governments are willing to issue a passport with an unspecified gender (X) or documents with updated information regarding the desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents also varies.
The security checkpoint screenings have become much more intrusive in the period after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people should not expect to undergo surgery without an invasion of privacy and with their dignity intact.
Return currents are currents that come back from waves breaking on the shore, often on reefs or something similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in some deeper sections, and a rapid flow towards the depths can form there.
Most deaths occur due to fatigue when swimming back against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you manage to escape the current, swimming back will be no different than usual.
Try to steer yourself to a place where you won't get trapped again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, wait for rescuers.
The shock of returning happens sooner than culture shock (there is no such long honeymoon period), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who easily adapted to a new culture sometimes find it very difficult to readjust to their own culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some habits from your home culture.
When you were abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, as they knew that travelers need to get used to a new country.
Perhaps people do not expect that even returning passengers must be patient and understanding.
The sound and light show with the pyramids is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
Before the start of the performance, you can view the pyramids in darkness and silence.
Usually, the sound of tourists and vendors is always heard. The story of sound and light is like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx serves as a backdrop and is the narrator of a long story.
Scenes are depicted on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, fall under the jurisdiction of several nations and have the most bases, 16 of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others, Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of the still active volcano serves as a stunning natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains here converge into a plateau, then re-emerge as the 360-km Ellsworth mountain range, divided by the Minnesota glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range lies the highest mountain range in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising to a height of 4,892 meters.
In remote areas without mobile signal, you might only be able to rely on a satellite phone.
A satellite phone usually cannot replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors and have an unobstructed view of the satellite to make a call.
This service is frequently used in shipping, including cruise ships, as well as in expeditions that require remote data and voice services.
The local telephone service provider can give you more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is travel and learning.
It is especially popular among final-year students, as it offers them a gap year before starting their studies without having to sacrifice their education for it.
It often happens that education during a one-year stay abroad actually increases the likelihood of an individual continuing their studies in their home country.
Usually, a tuition fee has to be paid to participate in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. Additionally, the "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the archipelagos along the coast.
In archipelagos and lakes, you don't need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are big enough for any kind of yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Rowing is the Finnish national sport, as every seventh or eighth person owns a boat.
It is the same in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise quite rare (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty).
Most special Baltic cruises include an extended stop in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that during a visit to the historic town, you can stay there for a few days all day long, and at night, you can return to the ship and sleep there.
If you go ashore only with ship excursions, you will not need a special visa (from 2009 onwards).
Some cruises in the brochures mention Berlin in Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not even close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience, regardless of how old people are or where they come from, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There is no need to be ashamed of it, as it is no different from personal fear and resistance to other things that many people struggle with.
If they understand a little about how airplanes work and what happens during the flight, it can help some people overcome the fear that stems from the unknown or lack of control.
Courier services are well-paid for delivering things quickly. Time is often crucial when it comes to business documents, commercial goods, or spare parts for urgent repair.
Larger companies have their own aircraft for certain routes, but for other routes and smaller companies, a problem has arisen.
If they send things via air freight, it can take several days on certain routes to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get them through faster is to send them as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
An obvious way to fly first or business class is to dig deep into your pocket for the privilege (or better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times more for business class than for economy class and eleven times more for first class!
In general, it doesn't make sense to even look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly for it.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The official language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has been shaken by ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the formation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member.
Despite unsuccessful political negotiations, economic ties were re-established between these parts of Moldova.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir, with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub, is the third largest city in Turkey.
The former ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, developed, and vibrant business hub concentrated around a large bay surrounded by mountains.
Traditional brick roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches accompany the wide avenues, buildings with glass facades, and a modern shopping center, although the city has a more European Mediterranean atmosphere than a traditional Turkish one.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and it also features an unusual octagonal church.
On some tombs in the churchyard, there are interesting marble statues of doves.
It's worth sacrificing half an hour for a walk through this interesting village.
In the north and quite accessible is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners when Lord Byron wrote such a brilliant description of its beauties.
The Scotturb 403 bus regularly runs to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you can also visit the beautiful Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a holy place), a site of world-renowned apparitions of Mary.
Keep in mind that you are actually at a mass grave as well as a site that holds almost unimaginable significance for a large portion of the world's population.
Many men and women who spent their time there are still alive, and even more are those whose loved ones were murdered there or worked to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
Behave with dignity, seriousness, and respect, as is appropriate. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not vandalize the place by tagging or scratching graffiti into buildings.
The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone can also speak Spanish.
Most signs are only in Catalan, which is legally designated as the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are only in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are communicated through an automatic system in various languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Even though this stereotype is often misguided, you will still get by best in Paris with good manners, behaving as someone who is "bien élevé" (well-brought-up). This will make your trip considerably easier.
The apparent brusqueness of Parisians will quickly dissipate if you show some basic manners.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir, and contains a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the diverse microclimate, different soils, and altitude, it is known for a wide range of plant communities.
This area is home to many different species of animals and birds.
Here you can encounter rare animals such as the brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat, and capercaillie as well as many more common species.
Women must wear skirts that go below the knees when visiting monasteries, and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries offer cloaks to women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it's brightly colored, you'll make the monk or nun at the entrance smile.
Similarly, men must also wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow these at the entrance, but you should know that they are not washed after each use, so it might not be very comfortable to wear them. A universal size is available for men.
Mallorcan cuisine, like the cuisines of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil in everything.
A simple and popular dish, especially in summer, is pa amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and all possible toppings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, besides the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way of distinguishing certain verbs and objects.
Moreover, it is supposed to make reading easier, although it somewhat complicates writing because it is necessary to determine whether the verb or adjective is used in its basic form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
You need to pay particular attention to the letters c and g, as their pronunciation differs depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, make an effort to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means car.
Persian has a relatively simple and fairly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
It goes without saying that you will find it easier to learn Portuguese if you master any Romance language.
Those who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough that they do not need to learn it separately.
Observatories from the pre-modern era are now obsolete and serve as museums or educational institutions.
Because in their golden days, light pollution was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or campuses and are more easily accessible than those that were built later.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous structures in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, or hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept came from China, where Japanese apricots were the most common choice of flowers.
The emperor hosted the first cherry blossom parties in Japan for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to pick a specimen, even if it's "just one".
When visiting an officially arranged garden, you will be kicked out without debate for collecting "specimens".
Singapore is generally a very safe city, and it is easy to navigate; upon arrival, you can buy almost anything.
In the "hot tropical zone," just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to contend with the heat (constantly) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, which happens rarely).
Some buses also drive north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Check if the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for organizing a trip.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or cruising to interesting cities along the Danube, or boating on the Erie Canal.
They are also used as popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Numerous customs associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers from Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
According to tradition, one should stay awake through the night on some exposed spot and await the sunrise.
For this tradition, there are, of course, Christian theological explanations, but it can also be a pre-Christian spring rite and a fertility ritual.
In more traditional churches, during the Easter weekend, an Easter vigil often takes place on Saturday night, where at midnight the gathering often turns into a celebration of the Resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands either swam, flew, or floated here.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, which is why the giant tortoise is the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you go to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
You will be offered a good opportunity to see the northern lights, as it is mostly dark all day during that period.
As the areas are sparsely populated and there is mostly no problem with light pollution, you will also be able to admire the stars.
The work culture in Japan is perhaps more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are accustomed to.
Suits are the standard business uniform, and colleagues address each other by surname or job title.
In the workplace, harmony is essential, with collective effort being more important than glorifying individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain approval from superiors for every decision, and they are expected to follow the instructions of their superiors without objection.
