Although it seems that one experimental vaccine may reduce mortality from Ebola, it has not yet been clearly proven that any drugs are suitable for treating the current infection.
One of the antibody cocktails, ZMapp, initially showed promise in this area, but studies have shown that it is not as effective in preventing deaths as was previously thought.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a starting point and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the US Olympic Committee and agrees that it is necessary for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all athletes.
We agree with the statement of the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOC) that significant changes in our organization, rather than the abolition of the organization, would benefit the interests of our athletes and clubs and their sports.

This announcement was made after Trump spoke by phone with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
Turkey would also agree to keep custody of captured ISIS fighters whom European countries have reportedly refused to repatriate.
This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs were feathered (a widely accepted theory) but also provides data that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the feathers on the top of this animal were reddish-brown, and on the bottom - pale or carotenoid-colored.
This discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but possess other feather features (barbs and barbules), researchers concluded that the rachis likely evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used not for flying, but more for regulating temperature or for display purposes. Researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult's feather covering, rather than a chick's down.
Researchers stated that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage rather than juvenile down.
Due to an explosive device detonating under a car near the police headquarters, two police officers were killed and more than twenty other people were injured.

The completed work was mostly theoretical, but the program was developed to simulate observations of the Sagittarius constellation.
The effect that the team was expecting would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon pulls the Earth, causing tides, so does the Milky Way exert force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way as any ordinary matter.
This theory suggests that the majority of dark matter around the galaxy is concentrated in the form of a halo and consists of numerous small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he stated that the new variant "is of great concern due to its very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have been infected in the hospital, believes Dr. Mollis; at least two of them were hospital staff.
In one year, an infected person can infect about 10-15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis is small; 6,000 out of 330,000 people infected in South Africa at any given time.

"During the day they are cooler than the surrounding surface, and at night they are warmer."
Their thermal behavior is not as constant as that of large Earth's caves, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but that is normal considering that these are deep holes in the ground," stated Glen Cushing from the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) astrogeology team and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been an activity not much associated with technology: voters enter a booth and place a sheet of paper marked with a candidate into an envelope.
Once the officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting roll.
The election law of France fairly strictly codifies the process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no other envelopes are added except those cast by properly counted and eligible voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe each stage of the process. In the evening, volunteers, observed by strict monitors, count the votes following specific procedures.

The police officers working in the city of Madja found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five individuals who raped the Swedish woman and have returned her mobile phone and laptop."
Defendants: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Višnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver severely injured his head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
At first, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been tried at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for the murder of her son.
She is arrested and is waiting for charges to be filed and for the trial to take place, but any witness testimony may be compromised because her photo was widely published.
This is standard practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice operates differently, and the courts believe that publishing photos could be harmful.
Dundee University professor Pamela Ferguson claims that "journalists seem to be walking on the edge of an abyss by publishing photos of suspects and the like."
The Royal Service, which oversees all criminal cases, told journalists that it would not provide further comments at least until the charges are formulated.
The leaked document indicates a dispute over borders that Palestine wants, taking into account the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
With the decline in knowledge of the Greek language, the West distanced itself from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to only five years.
The shooters who participated in an additional pest control trial had to be closely monitored by the park rangers, as the trial was being observed and its effectiveness assessed.
In collaboration with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were selected for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to NPWS park protection and heritage director Mick O'Flynn, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received a detailed safety and training briefing.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday in the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
Martelis is meeting with the Interim Election Commission for the fifth time in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the previous Interim Electoral Council as part of a package of measures aimed at transitioning the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Without holding elections, some not since 2011, protests erupted with outbreaks of violence.
There have been reports of 60 malfunctioning iPods overheating, resulting in six fires and minor burns for four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 device-related accidents.
Last week, METI announced that Apple reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "minor."
The Ministry responded by calling the delay of the "Apple" report "truly regrettable".
Mariana was shaken by an earthquake at 07:19 a.m. local time (Friday, 09:19 p.m. GMT).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands' Emergency Management Office, residents have not reported any damages.
Moreover, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center indicated that there are no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital, Manila.
Rolandas Mendoza fired an M16 weapon at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and it has been confirmed that at least six are dead so far.
Earlier, six hostages were released, including children and elderly people, as well as photographers from the Philippines.
Later, the photographers swapped places with an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed his father's example and started his career in the field of medicine.
He studied obstetrics and started working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, during his free time, Ligins began investigating premature contractions.
His research showed that the fetus's lungs mature faster when the hormone is used.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators retrieved data from the black box recorders of two flights.
Other wrestlers also honored Luna.
Tommy Dreamer has said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme situations. My first manager. Luna died on a night of two moons. Completely uniquely, just as she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was just as much of a weirdo as I was... Maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place now."
Even before the 2010 federal elections, a survey of 1,400 people revealed that the opponents of Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard expressed her belief that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
34 percent of respondents hold this opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Speaking of radical responses, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle events and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but complaints raise doubts about his physical condition.
He could not take pain medication, as they are prohibited during the games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
By the end of February, a few people had tested the invention using various software and hardware, and it was reported on Tuesday.
It could be that comets brought water and organic materials to Earth, which can create proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth was formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo became governor in '53 earlier this year, and last month he signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political blather and foolishness."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
"NextGen" is a system by which the FAA claims that if aircraft were to fly shorter routes, it would save millions of liters of fuel annually and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Satellite technology, rather than older ground-based radar technology, is used so that air traffic controllers can more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no additional transport, overground trains will not stop at "Wembley", and parking as well as "park and ride" services will not be provided.
Fear of a transport shortage prompted consideration that the match could be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
The study published in the journal "Science" on Thursday reports the formation of a new bird species in Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer due to the hybridization of the endemic medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis) and the immigrant large cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be shaped into a wide variety of forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
By drawing it out, a thin wire can be made, which can be twisted or braided. It can be forged or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be so thin that sometimes it has been used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical. An indicator can be made from red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice indicates how acidic or basic (alkaline) a substance is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the letter H in the abbreviation pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which their electrons have been removed (a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two types of powder, then compress them into a clump with clean wet hands.
The moisture from hands will react with the outer layers, which are not very clean, and will form a kind of protective shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of drainage systems were found in homes in the Minoan civilization cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets already existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women would be together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using satellite communication.
The satellite in space receives a signal and returns it almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of the light and image.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a gigantic 100-foot (about 30 meters) tall rocket is required.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest benefit of the wheel is much easier and faster transportation.
He provided us with a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
The other group consists of medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized animals, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
And lastly – the small cats (including domesticated cats living in the wild), which eat a much more varied prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success secret is the understanding of the right place – a special task that each cat has to perform and that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
The family consists of one to three adult males related by kinship and up to thirty females and juveniles.
Females are usually closely related to each other, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides operate similarly to packs of wolves or dogs (animals that are very similar to lions, but not to other cats) and are also ruthless to their prey.
The tiger, a large and athletic animal, can climb (though not perfectly), swim, leap long distances, and has a pulling strength five times greater than that of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four cats can roar.
The roar of a tiger does not compare to the thundering roar of a lion. It is more similar to a loudly growled sentence.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all animals hunted by ocelots are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find the animals they intend to eat (prey) by scent, sniffing the ground where they have been.
They see very well in the dark because they have night vision ability and move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with the environment, then seizing it.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which they belonged (e.g., crosses a mountain range, swims across a river, or moves to a new island and cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one in which they lived before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so for the new population to be a strong competitor, it will need different traits or changes than before.
The initial population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptation.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it starts to look less and less like other populations.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they will not be able to be classified as the same species.
We call this process the formation of new species. The formation of new species is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and it is part of the carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants produce food from the sun through the process of photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Many of the foods we eat are plants. Animals could not survive without plants.
The Mosasaurus was the most powerful predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasauruses.
In his long jaws, there were more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and there were also teeth on the upper part of the mouth, which meant that nothing crossing his path could escape.
We don't know exactly, but its tongue might have been forked. It fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps it was even a cannibal.
He would attack anyone who entered the water. Not even a huge tyrannosaurus would match him.
Many of their foods will be familiar to us, but the Romans also had unusual or exotic feast dishes, including boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate food sitting on chairs, while wealthy men liked to hold feasts during which they would recline on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman dishes could not contain foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, considered the house of the god.
People would make offerings to the gods, and the priests sought to meet the gods' needs during rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, as well as an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, as part of temples, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built.
A special temple for the god was established at the top of the tower.
Given such a warm Middle Eastern climate, the house was not that important.
Hebrew families spent most of their time outdoors.
Women were cooking food in the yard. Shops were just open counters facing the street. Stones were used in building the houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely inhabited. Ancient Scandinavian sagas state that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, traveling further west, discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country is considered "Scandinavian," there are quite a few differences related to the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie "National Treasure", you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the other side of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the other side of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the other side of the Declaration of Independence was the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text is at the bottom of the document, inverted.
Although no one knows exactly who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence this large parchment document (measuring 29.75 x 24.5 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
Therefore, it is likely that this note was written down simply as a title.
During the days of landings and subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the south was still occupied.
That part was governed by the Vichy French. These French reconciled with the Germans in 1940 and worked together, instead of fighting the invaders.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France – the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces managed to liberate the southern part of France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a specific culture characteristic of a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin word "civilis," which means civil, is related to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and also somehow defines the size of the community.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. The culture of civilization means the transmission of knowledge from one generation to another, a continuous cultural legacy, and considerable dissemination.
Small cultures often vanish without leaving significant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government (whose only part was Congress) based on the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to regulate taxes, and since there was no national executive authority or court system, it relied on state authorities, which, in carrying out all its actions, usually did not cooperate.
She also did not have the authority to disregard tax laws and tariffs between states.
To amend the articles, unanimous consent of all the states was required, and the states adopted the central government so carelessly that their representatives often did not attend.
The Italy national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after the Germany national football team, and became the winner of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the Northern regions – Italians participate in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island country in the world!
Due to the cluster of islands / group of islands that Japan has, it is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago".
Taiwan was discovered in the 15th century when it was visited by European sailors and named "Ilha Formosa," which means "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning the transformation of the indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) took control of the western and northern coasts of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed so that tourists can better understand what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most widespread still image photography format in the world is 35 mm. This frame size dominated at the end of the analog film era.
Today it is still being produced, but even more important is that its aspect ratio has been adopted by the formats of digital camera image sensors.
The name of the 35 mm format is misleading; in fact, it is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, it is said that the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the ratio of the smallest integers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS format family) are equivalent to or very close to this image format.
The often overused and mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism and maintains some order in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the main object is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period of European history, the Catholic Church, which became wealthy and powerful, attracted much attention.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united the countries of Europe, despite differences in languages and customs.
Her all-encompassing power affected everyone – from the king to the common person.
One of the main principles of Christianity states that wealth should be used to reduce suffering and poverty, and that the church's treasury is meant precisely for this purpose.
The central Church authority had been based in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money led many to question whether such doctrine was being followed.
Shortly after such aggression, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, disrupting the supply of crucial military and civilian provisions, although this blockade violated universally accepted international law, sanctioned by several international treaties concluded over the past two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters so that no ships would enter any parts of the ocean and pose a threat even to inactive state vessels.
Since the tactics were met with a weak response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, most people and entire nations lived by the ideas of pacifism and isolationism.
Seeing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job offer at the Edison Company, located in New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different periods; each phase of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Moreover, the interregnum of dynasties was a period of instability for the divided provinces. The best-known such period is the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the rule of the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars took place among the many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, when thousands died fighting for the right to sit on the main throne of the grand palace in Xian.
There are many social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that a country belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
After the revolution, all willing men could participate in occupations where success smiled upon the most ambitious and successful.
The same can be said about the army – now military ranks were granted based on personal qualities, not class.
The French Revolution inspired the oppressed working-class people of many other countries to stage their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond the boundaries of everyday life. He often visited the cave on Mount Noor (light), which became known as "Hira," to engage in contemplation.
The cave itself, having withstood the test of time, offers a very vivid insight into Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave was on one of the mountain tops to the north of Mecca, thus completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Even if you knew that such a cave exists, finding it is not easy at all. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
Nothing to see, only the clear, beautiful sky above and many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau (also known as the "Giza Necropolis"), located in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), some smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Cheops' wives and family members.
The "upper grinding" sign looks like a V, while the "lower grinding sign" resembles a join or a square without the bottom part.
"Up" means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, while "down" means that you should start from the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow produces a stronger, harsher one.
Feel free to write notes by hand, but remember that printed notes exist for musical reasons, so this should generally be respected.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis Charles), and the king's sister Madame Élisabeth were forcibly returned from Versailles to Paris by a crowd of market women on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, someone from the crowd waved the head of a Royal Guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The expenses of the US imperialism war aimed at conquering the Philippines were covered by the Filipinos themselves.
They were persuaded to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover the majority of expenses and the interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government (but using Wall Street banks).
Of course, the profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos were the main revenues of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to know the context that led to the formation of the order.
The era during which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages is the period between the Early and Late Middle Ages. It is generally considered that the latter ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing various practical ideas – from the advancement or necessity of technology to the precise meaning that human destiny is determined by the inherent logic associated with the laws of science and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology itself proceeds in a direction fundamentally surpassing cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has an "impact" on society that is inherent rather than dependent on social conditions.
For example, someone might say that once a car is created, roads will inevitably be constructed.
However, the national road network is not economically viable if only a few cars use it, therefore new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Due to the widespread presence of cars on the roads, the number of accidents increases, which contributes to the invention of new healthcare methods for treating bodily injuries.
Cultural determinism, characteristic of Romanticism, was adopted from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, people were shaped by geography, and over time customs and culture related to it emerged, which, aligning with the society's location, were more suitable than the arbitrarily imposed laws.
Yes, just as Paris is now famous as the fashion capital of modern times, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
He became famous as the epicenter of luxury around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
In the 12th century, its status diminished primarily because the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine market had to offer.
It was at that time that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished between the periods of the 10th–11th and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication, styles sometimes reached the West after 25–30 years.
As the Middle Ages came to an end, a unique style began to develop in Western Europe. One of the most significant changes that emerged due to the Crusades was that people started fastening their clothes with buttons.
Subsistence farming is agriculture conducted to grow enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses local ecoregion seeds and applies crop rotation or other relatively simple fertility enhancement methods.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence farming, and in many developing countries, they still do.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel like they don't fit into societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may vary due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often express their membership in a distinctive and symbolic way using style, including fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most popular ways to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to take several examples of children who, growing up, were not socialized due to adult negligence or intentional abuse.
Children like these are called "unmanageable" or wild. Some unmanageable children were isolated from society by people (usually their own parents); sometimes these children were abandoned because the parents did not acknowledge the child's severe intellectual or physical disorder.
Wild children may have experienced significant violence or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
It is suspected that others were raised by animals; some lived independently in the wild.
If a wild child is raised not by humans, they behave (within the limits of physical abilities) almost like the animal that took care of them, for example, they fear humans or ignore them.
While project-based learning should facilitate learning and make it more interesting, scaffolded learning is even more beneficial.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a support for individuals who are learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but the same can be said about the Microsoft Office paperclip.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is designed to discuss, encourage, and explain procedures that are challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children end up in foster care for a variety of reasons: from neglect to violence and even abuse.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educative, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is like a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system must provide safe homes, loving guardians, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Guardians should provide the child with everything that was lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The internet connects elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to the emergence of additional dimensions in terms of usage and the fulfillment of desires.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
J. Eighmey and L. McCord (1998), while studying audience reactions to a website, also identified new motivational aspects—“personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships.”
Using videos, important discoveries have been made in interpreting facial expressions and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
First of all, it is claimed that it is possible to determine if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his work "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks asserts that people who cannot understand language due to brain damage are very adept at recognizing sincerity.
He even claims that such an ability to understand human behavior can also be possessed by animals, for example, domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds new genetic variation while selection removes it from the expressed variations of the combined sample.
Segregation and recombination result in the mixing of variants in two groups of each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to a human's, to meet its amino acid needs from available plant sources.
Such a deficiency has serious consequences: stunted growth, poor nutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest sources of protein would be plant leaves and pods, but for primates like us, it is difficult to digest them raw.
On the contrary, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides a lot of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
Taking everything into account, you should not be surprised that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in almost the same way as today's chimpanzees in the savannah.
Sleep interruption is a deliberate awakening during normal sleep and falling back asleep after a short period (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a relatively quiet alarm that will restore your consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you turn off your alarm while sleeping, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based alternative is drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep, as this will force the sleeper to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more confident and vibrant you feel. Everyone can find complete peace and satisfaction.
Every person can attain enlightenment. The only obstacle preventing you from achieving this goal is your tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and numerous Indian yoga methods.
Essentially, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through various yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan Meditation Center is "Deity Yoga." By visualizing various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightenment is achieved.
Germany in World War 2 was a common enemy that prompted cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures led to confrontation.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It continued for another 40 years and was actually fought using mercenary armies from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the defense of Poland had already been overcome, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became outdated almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements, creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
The use of ships for transporting goods remains the most efficient way to carry large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the task of the navy has been to ensure the movement of people and goods in your country and to prevent the enemy from moving their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the Second World War campaign in the North Atlantic. The Americans tried to transport troops and materials across the Atlantic to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, primarily using submarines, attempted to halt the transport of these cargoes.
If the Allies had been defeated, Germany probably could have conquered Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
According to available data, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains located in Iran.
Ancient peoples and tribes began keeping them to easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds, wandering on hills or other pastures, often looked after by goat herders, who were typically children or teenagers, much like the more well-known shepherds. This practice continues to this day.
The railway in England appeared as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon routes consisted only of wooden planks laid parallel, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to do so faster and it was possible to pull larger loads than on the less even roads of that time.
The sleepers were created quite a long time ago to strengthen the rails. However, it gradually became clear that rails are more effective if covered with metal.
It became common practice, but iron would wear out wooden wagon wheels more.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known way of traveling was walking. People started walking upright two million years ago – that was when Homo Erectus (the upright human) appeared.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not always walk upright.
Signs of adaptation for walking on two legs can be seen in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2–3.9 million years, but Sahelanthropus might have been able to walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living with less harm to the environment, join the environmental movement, and even be activists to some extent reduce the likelihood of suffering in the future.
In many cases, it is similar to symptomatic treatment. However, to achieve more than just a temporary solution, we must find and eliminate the causes of the problems.
It is quite obvious that the world has significantly changed due to human scientific and technological achievements, and problems have increased due to overpopulation and an extravagant lifestyle.
Once the Congress adopted it on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "Dunlap broadsides," were made overnight.
John Nixon publicly read the document for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One such document was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy of the document reached London on August 10.
Twenty-five still existing Dunlap copies, which are known, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and fly.
But birds have still retained many similarities with dinosaurs.
Their feet had scales and claws, they laid eggs, and walked on two hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
The basis of essentially all computers used today is the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number has only one of two values, which are 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or in computer jargon – bits.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately noticeable. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are quite general, which may make it difficult to diagnose right away.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning is an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
On the label, find the first aid instructions for the specific substance that has been ingested.
Entomologists formally use the term "bug" to name this group of insects.
This term originated from the bed bugs known in ancient times - these insects are well adapted to being human parasites.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are endophilic, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their or their child's best interests.
These couples can make an adoption plan for their baby.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to find out about the existence of the world and related matters by applying the scientific method. This method is indeed crucial in many scientific studies.
However, it is not the only thing – an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions, while observations also help to direct scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused mainly on classical texts, particularly the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views became popular in all branches of science, including psychology.
The Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq was set on fire during riots.
Most observed physiological and behavioral rhythms often heavily depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their formation influenced by biological clocks.
It has been observed that most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, have periodically recurring cycles that are not a response to recurring external stimuli.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining generators that maintain cyclicality even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important in proving that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into the bacterium.
They conducted two experiments by labeling the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a wide range of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected part of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations at the germ level can be passed on to offspring, while elsewhere mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who wish to visit natural sites to admire the scenery, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
On-site activities offered include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting orangutans, photographing, and learning about them in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of small towns in their cars to get to their workplaces, while others pass by them, whose workplace is in the area that the former have just left.
In this dynamic system of routing vehicles, everyone is somehow interconnected and supports the vehicle system based on private cars.
According to science, this large-scale carbon economy has undermined the stability of the biosphere that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the life of the society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or crumbling bridges.
Why does the transportation system cause such complaints, why does it experience problems every day? Are the transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is the problem more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the science of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their mutual interaction.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because it is impossible to predict drivers' behavior with one hundred percent accuracy.
Great, that drivers behave quite consistently on the road; thus, traffic flows usually have a certain reasonable consistency and can be approximately calculated mathematically.
To better convey traffic flow, the relationships of the three main characteristics have been established: 1) flow, 2) density, and 3) speed.
These relationships help to plan, design, and operate road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily avoid predators and to find food and mates more efficiently.
The advantage of many insects is that they can fold their wings back along their bodies.
It allows them to hide from predators in many small places.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the Solar System, along with the Sun (and other stars), moves around the Earth.
It seems logical, as we do not feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, almost 10 km wide.
20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramids were built of stones until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza have never been surpassed in size and technical perfection.
The New Kingdom ancient Egyptians admired the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were more than a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world with the fewest inhabitants.
The Italian language is used in Vatican legislation and official communications.
Italian is also a language that is used daily by the majority of the state's employees, and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican residents are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been knowledgeable about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, copper, because they can be found in nature in their usual form and are easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more akin to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also developed the theory that they transform into new materials that make up what we see.
Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals as well – silver, gold.
You can also have alloys with small amounts of non-metal elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the full stop at the end of this sentence.
So the appearing pencil was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of newer writing methods, the status of the pencil has weakened and its usage has decreased.
Now people write messages on computer screens and they never need to look for a sharpener.
One can only imagine what the keyboard will become with the advent of some newer technology.
The operation of a nuclear bomb is based on the principle that a lot of energy is needed to maintain a nucleus containing many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart up a hill. The nucleus splits again and releases some energy.
The nucleus of some atoms is not stable, meaning that they tend to decay with little or no friction.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the closer side and 100 km thick on the farther side.
She is slimmer beneath the Moon Sea and thicker beneath the highlands.
On the near side, there may be more lunar seas because the crust is thinner, making it easier for lava to reach the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what activates people or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they mature.
These theories examine what drives certain people to want what they do and what environmental factors cause them to do certain things or not do them.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Simply put, when managers begin to lead their former colleagues, two types of behavior can emerge. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" or "one of the girls".
It is difficult for such leaders to make unpopular decisions, take actions to maintain discipline, evaluate work, assign responsibilities, and manage people.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable person who thinks that the whole team's work needs to be changed to make it one's own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
Such behavior often causes disagreements between managers and other team members.
Virtual teams are held to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members are often the point of contact for their direct physical group.
They are often more independent than regular team members because their teams might meet in different time zones that the local management may not understand.
The presence of genuine "invisible teams" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique aspect of a virtual team.
"The Invisible Team" is a management team to which all members report. The Invisible Team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization spend a lot of time creating a training organization? The purpose of applying organizational training concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Therefore, the organization works together to overcome the obstacle and create a new process that meets the client's needs.
For an organization to become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angelas (2006) explains the method of continuity as a method that is used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide evidence for the physical theories in the study of cognition. Therefore, they narrow the field of scientific research and make it much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior confirms the hypothesis of the scientists' study.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
With the advent of new technologies, we have the opportunity to see and explore brain structures and processes that have not been seen before.
It provides us with a lot of information and material that helps to create simulation models and better understand the processes.
Although AI has a strong connotation with science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science, examining issues of behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Researching AI-created machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent actions.
Examples include management, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and inquiries, as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and face.
These fields have become separate disciplines focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and it is also integrated into several home computer and video game applications.
Excursions are an important part of any class. Quite often, teachers would like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology provides a solution – virtual tours. Students can explore historical tools in the museum, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a tour virtually is a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future groups.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital; each year this website is reconstructed, but the old versions are kept online as a memory album.
Moreover, blogs can improve students' spelling. Although the grammar and spelling of students in the initial blogs are often sloppy, the existing audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer strives to write as perfectly as possible to avoid criticism.
Moreover, blogging "encourages students to think more broadly about the surrounding world." The need to engage the audience inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning beyond the walls of a traditional school.
Properly used blogs can help students develop analytical and critical thinking skills; by actively responding to online material, students can express their position in light of other people's posts, as well as describe their views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital of Canada, rich in art galleries and museums where Canada's past and future intertwine.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north, the untouched, natural beauty of Lake Muskoka and other areas captivates.
All these and other things in Ontario are considered genuine elements of Canada by newcomers.
Further north, large areas are quite sparsely populated, and in some places, there are almost uninhabited wilderness areas.
A comparison of populations that surprises many: There are fewer Canadian citizens than African Americans living in the USA.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean along the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island, and, when it comes to wildlife, it can be called a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France and are famous for luxury resorts established on beaches.
Moreover, the Arabs brought Islam to the islands, and it firmly established itself in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route from Europe to India by way of the Cape of Good Hope.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Additionally, it is advisable to wear a ring (just not one that looks very expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences might lead them to experience what they might consider harassment. Someone might start following them, grab their hand, or the like.
Firmly reject men and do not be afraid to stand by your principles (cultural differences do not mean it is appropriate to act that way).
The current city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port, known by the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it, naming it Casablanca, but abandoned it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who established trading bases here.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping destinations in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and various trinkets, but all of these are intended for tourists.
Goma is a city frequently visited by tourists in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered a large part of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is fairly safe, before traveling beyond its borders, one should seek information to understand the state of the ongoing conflicts in the North Kivu province.
From this city, it is also possible to climb Mount Nyiragongo and book one of the cheapest treks in Africa to watch mountain gorillas.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to travel around Goma. The usual (local) price for a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
Considering the complex accessibility, "Timbuktu" has turned into a metaphor describing exotic and distant places.
Today Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation attracts tourists; the city has an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the list of World Heritage sites that are endangered due to desert sands.
It was one of the main stops in Henry Louis Gates's special PBS program "Wonders of the African World."
The city is completely different from other cities in the country because it has more of an Arabic rather than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the Mozambique border to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern boundary of the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 ecological zones, each of which protects different wildlife.
This is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the best example of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all national parks in South Africa, this park has daily conservation and entrance fees.
It may be useful to purchase a "Wild Card," which allows access either to specific South African parks or to all South African national parks.
The name of the Hong Kong territory originated from the name of Hong Kong Island, which, moreover, is of the greatest interest to tourists.
It is reported that one of the richest people in the world, Allen, has invested a large portion of his wealth into marine exploration and has begun his search to find the war that has fascinated Musashi all his life.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and sail to Kowloon on the opposite shore.
Most of the urban areas on Hong Kong Island are densely developed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
The British colonizers considered this place their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest continuous mangrove area in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast towards Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans – a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests consist not only of mangrove swamps but also of several of the last remaining powerful jungle forests and thickets that once grew on the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², about one-third of which consists of water/marshland areas.
Since 1966, animals have reigned in the Sundarbans. It is believed that about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 axis deer now live in this area.
Buses depart from the district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most buses, especially those going east and to Jakar / Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is recommended to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Comfortable and sturdy Japanese minibuses "Coaster" travel to many districts.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient means to get to nearby places such as Para (Nu 150) and Punaka (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. Crossing the Oyapock River, it connects the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with the city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters tall, and the bridge is 378 meters long, consisting of two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be operational from September 2017, as the Brazilian border checkpoints are expected to be fully installed by then.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in the present-day territory of eastern Paraguay – they were semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in agriculture for sustenance.
In the Chaco region, there lived other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and the Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as the "Giant Province of India," emerged when Spanish conquistadors encountered groups of indigenous people.
The Spaniards began a three-century-long colonization.
Since its founding in 1537, Asuncion has managed to preserve its local character and identity in Paraguay.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year takes place in December at the Las Canitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions take place here at other times of the year.
You will find news about the matches and where to purchase tickets for the polo games on the Argentine Polo Association's website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is set at par with the value of one British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged only at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds, as well as "Stanley" credit cards, are commonly accepted everywhere on the islands; United States dollars are also frequently accepted.
In remote islands, bank cards are probably not accepted; however, it may be possible to pay with British and United States currency. Inquire in advance with the owners about which payment method they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so change your money before leaving the islands.
Montevideo is south of the equator, so it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is characterized by a subtropical climate; during the summer months, the temperature often exceeds +30 °C.
Winter can be deceptively harsh: the temperature is rarely negative, but due to the wind and humidity, it feels colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals see people, nature is still wild, and animals should not be fed or disturbed in any way.
As requested by the park administration, maintain at least 100 yards/meters distance from bears or wolves and 25 yards/meters distance from all other wildlife!
Bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals, no matter how friendly they may seem, can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Additionally, keep in mind that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or preparing fragrant foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of slightly less than 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notoriously famous naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed at a peaceful gathering in the city.
Because Auckland encompasses two harbors, it has many beaches. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches, which are safe for swimming, and many of them offer shade under the mature pine trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in the Waitemata Harbour, in the prestigious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Auckland's center.
Sometimes these are crowded family beaches with many shops located along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", and even though it is not a complex beer, it is very smooth and refreshing. Another local beer is "Manta".
One can choose from a wide variety of French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may captivate more.
It is completely safe to drink the local tap water, but if you are worried, bottled water is easy to find.
The idea of coffee with milk (English "flat white") is foreign to Australians. A small amount of black coffee is an espresso, a cappuccino is served with cream (not whipped) on top, and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate that meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices, though expensive, are excellent.
Trips to the reef occur year-round, and injuries due to any of these reasons are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, heed all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish can be found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the 1770 town. They can sometimes be found outside this period as well.
Sharks do indeed exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Pre-booking gives the traveler peace of mind, knowing they will have a place to stay when they reach their destination.
Travel agencies often have contracts with specific hotels, although through a travel agency you can also book other accommodations, such as campsites.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation to and from, or even joint flight and hotel packages.
They can also reserve a spot for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents required in the country you are visiting (e.g., a visa).
Although any changes or requests must first be submitted to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to stay on the festival grounds because they believe it is an inseparable part of the festival experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to arrive early to get a campsite closer to the music.
Don't forget that even if the performances on the main stages are over, the festival may have designated areas where music will play until late in the evening.
At some festivals, special campsites for families with small children are set up.
If you are sailing in the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, pay attention to the location of the cabin, as there can be significant noise when sailing through ice.
A cruise to St. Petersburg includes walks around the old town. Cruise passengers do not need to obtain a visa (review the conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to ensure that guests spend as much time as possible with them and spend as much money as possible. There are often no clocks or windows in casinos, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and prevent them from wanting to leave.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are offered for free. However, drunkenness impairs decisions, so all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who intends to drive in high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or negative temperatures.
On roads covered with ice and snow, there is little friction, making it impossible to drive as on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a short time that it will be impossible to move.
Visibility may be limited by falling or blowing snow, as well as fogging or icy car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic moves continuously throughout the year.
A safari is probably the most tourist-attracting and unique visitor attraction in Africa.
The term "safari" is widely used to describe travel overland with the aim of witnessing the stunning African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach cars, so you will see them well even with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better through binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "tracking on foot") consists of a hike lasting a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24, 2021, to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice. The games were held in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for the year 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a tricky situation.
The provisions of cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most companies do not apply the coronavirus cancellation policy for July 2020, when the Olympic Games were supposed to take place.
Ticket prices for many events are expected to range from 2500 JPY to 130,000 JPY, with the cost of regular tickets being approximately 7000 JPY.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. In many hotels, you can rent an iron and an ironing board, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer (if you have one).
Do not let the fabric overheat (it may shrink or, in extreme cases, scorch).
Water can be purified in different ways, some of which are more effective in dealing with specific threats.
In some places, it's enough to boil the water for a minute, in others, a few minutes are needed.
The efficiency of filters varies. If you are concerned about this, it is better to purchase water in a tightly sealed bottle from a reliable company.
Travelers may encounter animal parasites that are not typical in their native region.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause an allergic reaction, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force are generally not considered pests.
Shopping at duty-free stores is an opportunity to purchase tax-free goods at certain locations.
People traveling to countries where high taxes are applied can sometimes save a significant amount, especially when purchasing products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
Driving conditions are the most difficult on the section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont, as the road winds through forested areas.
If you haven't driven on the country's roads, be vigilant: there are steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than those given in previous or subsequent sections – usually 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important.
Strangely, the mobile signal here is much stronger than in other sections of the road, e.g., "Pennsylvania Wilds."
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich in flavor and diverse, similar to those of its southern neighbor Austria.
Regular fruit pies, which are baked with apple filling all year round, and with cherry and plum filling in the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other types of nuts. Popular pastries are often eaten with strong coffee.
If you want to taste small but rich-flavored pastries, try the baked goods that are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen in different regions.
The stew is a dish based on herbs and spices, as well as meat and vegetables.
The curry can be "dry" or "wet," depending on how much liquid it contains.
In the northern regions of India and inland Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry dishes; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
With 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is a general term that encompasses the many local cuisines of the country.
But if this term is used without additional explanation, it generally refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widespread in the archipelago, is characterized by simple seasonal dishes with predominant spices including peanuts, chili pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups support the rider's legs, hanging on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with greater stability but can pose safety concerns as the rider's foot might get stuck.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged as the horse runs. To reduce this risk, several precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots that have a heel and a smooth and fairly narrow sole.
Moreover, some saddles, especially those of the English type, are equipped with safety bars from which the leather loop of the stirrup slips off when a falling rider pulls it back.
Kočamo Valley is a major rock climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, featuring many large granite walls and steep cliffs.

Popular downhill winter sports, with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity, with many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums," planning their entire vacations around skiing in a particular area.
The idea of skiing is very old – skiers were depicted in cave paintings as early as 5000 BC!
The sport of alpine skiing dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first leisure skiing club in Austria.
Ski touring: this activity is also called skiing in remote areas or ski tourism.
It is related, but usually does not include Alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter being done on steeper terrain and requiring harder skis and boots.
Think of a skiing route as similar to a hiking route.
With good conditions, you will be able to cover a slightly greater distance than walking, but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing, when skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would require applying for visas multiple times and stopping at border checkpoints for passport control.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions somewhat like a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you will generally be able to cross borders without having to go through passport control points again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, there is no need to apply to each Schengen area member country for visas – this saves time, money, and avoids bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition by which manufactured items are defined as antiques. Some tax administrators define items older than 100 years as antiques.
This definition varies in different regions, for example, the age limit in places like North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handmade products may be described as antiques, even though they are made later than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture associated with trade is also important to people in most other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sámi were extensively involved in reindeer herding – they lived from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer mostly as working animals.
Today, many Sami people are acquiring modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, a region inhabited by the Sami.
Although the word "gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Romani people, it is often considered offensive as it raises associations with negative stereotypes and an inaccurate perception of who the Roma are.
If a travel warning is issued for the country you are visiting, it may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You might also want to check the advice of other countries' governments, not just your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
As an example, it can be mentioned that American citizens in the Middle East may encounter various situations involving Europeans and Arabs.
The advice provides brief information about the political situation in the country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, and very simplified compared to the detailed information available elsewhere.
Complex weather conditions is a general term that refers to any hazardous weather phenomenon that may cause damage, disrupt social order, or result in the loss of life.
Extreme meteorological phenomena can be observed all over the world, moreover, there are different types of them, which depend on geographical, topographical, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy precipitation, and fires, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones are forms of bad weather and the consequences they leave behind.
More severe regional and seasonal meteorological phenomena include blizzards, winter storms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are highly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather that might affect the area they are visiting, as weather conditions can impact certain travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that may be considered a war zone must be trained by professionals.
Typing "hostile environment courses" in an internet search will probably lead you to the address of a local company.
Courses usually examine all the issues discussed here in much more detail, typically providing practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2–5 days and includes role-playing games, a lot of first aid, and sometimes training on weapons.
Books and magazines that talk about surviving in the wild are popular, but there are few publications that write about war zones.
Travelers planning a gender reassignment surgery must ensure they have the proper documentation to return.
Not all governments are favorable to the possibility of issuing passports where the gender is unspecified (X), or updating documents to reflect the preferred name, surname, and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents also varies greatly.
After September 11, 2001, searches at checkpoints became significantly stricter.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to pass through scanners without compromising their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves breaking onshore, often occurring near reefs and the like.
The returning current, due to the underwater topology, concentrates in a few deeper areas. Here, a fast downward-carrying current can form.
Most often, people perish due to fatigue while trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you drift out of the current, returning is harder than usual.
Try to steer somewhere you failed to catch again, or, depending on your skills and whether you were noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
The shock of returning to reality manifests earlier than culture shock (as if the honeymoon is over), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
For travelers who find it easy to adapt to a new culture, it is sometimes particularly difficult to return to their native culture.
After returning home from living in another country, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some habits of your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adapt.
People might not consider that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.

Other islands are Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano forms an impressive natural harbor.
Elsworth Land is a region located in the south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge into a plateau, then rise again, forming the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains range, which is cut by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest point is 4,892 m, Mount Vinson.

A much more popular option for those planning to take a year off is traveling and learning.
It is especially popular among school graduates as it gives them the opportunity to take a break before university studies without compromising their education.

Usually, to participate in these trainings, a certain fee must be paid.
Finland is a great place for boating. In the "land of a thousand lakes," there are also thousands of islands in the lakes and coastal archipelago.
A yacht is not necessary on the archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland – there is one boat for every eight people.
Residents of Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand are not far behind this number, but in other cases, it is quite unusual (for example, in the Netherlands, this number is from 0 to 40).
Many different Baltic cruises feature a longer visit to St. Petersburg (Russia).
This means that you can visit the historic city for two days, returning to sleep on the ship at night.
If you disembark only as a participant of an excursion boat, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures depict Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
A flight by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and social groups, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.

For some people, knowing how an aircraft works and what happens during the flight can help overcome the fear that is based on the unknown or the inability to control the situation.
Parcel delivery companies are well compensated for fast delivery. Often, time is crucial when delivering business documents, goods, or spare parts in case of urgent repairs.
For some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and for smaller companies, a problem has arisen.
When shipping goods by air, unloading and customs clearance on some routes used to take more than one day.
The only faster way was to send the package as checked baggage. Airline regulations won’t allow sending baggage without a passenger, and that’s where your role begins.
An obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a substantial amount of money for this privilege (or even better, if your company does it for you).
However, it is not cheap: as practice shows, you can expect to pay four times more than the usual economy class price compared to business class and even eleven times compared to first class!
Simply put, there is no point in even looking for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers willing to pay extra for the privilege of reaching something quickly and comfortably, so they impose such charges.
