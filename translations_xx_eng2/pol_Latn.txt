This confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a popular theory, but it also provides such details as color and three-dimensional arrangement, which cannot be obtained from fossils.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was chestnut on top and light or carotene-colored underneath.
This discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
As the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but do have other feather features—barbs and barbules—scientists concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary stage than those other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flying, but for regulating temperature or for display. According to scientists, this is the plumage of an adult individual, not a chick, even though the tail belonged to a young dinosaur.
Researchers suggested that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the feathering of the specimen indicates an adult individual, not a chick.

The work was predominantly of a theoretical nature, but the program was written for simulating observations of galaxies in the constellation Sagittarius.
The effect sought by the team would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon influences the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way exerts its force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way standard matter does.
This theory states that most dark matter surrounds the galaxy like a kind of halo, composed of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In the interview, he stated that the new variant was "very problematic and concerning due to the high mortality rate."
According to Dr. Moll, some patients might have contracted the virus in the hospital, and at least two of them were healthcare workers employed at the hospital.
In the course of a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom they have had close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the group of people with tuberculosis still seems low, with 6,000 out of 330,000 infected at any given time in South Africa.

"The thermal environment here is not as stable as in large caves on Earth, where a fairly constant temperature is often maintained, but this is because we are dealing with deep openings," said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) scientific research agency and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff.
In France, voting has usually been a low-tech activity: voters cast their ballots in a booth and place the printed card indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
Once the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter casts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law quite strictly defines the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers have no doubt that there are no envelopes in the box at the moment the polling station opens and that no envelopes are being put into it except for envelopes that are duly counted and authorized by voters.
Candidates have the opportunity to send their representatives to observe each stage of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and in accordance with specified procedures.

The first event was the slalom, in which she did not finish the first run. With the same result, 36 out of 116 competitors finished the race.
In the second race (giant slalom), she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting category with a total time of 4:41:30, which was 2:11:60 slower than the winner, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09:02 slower than the ninth-place finisher, Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers in the group of sitting competitors did not finish the race, and 45 out of 117 skiers participating in the giant slalom were not classified.
Police in Madhya Pradesh have recovered a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five men who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The following individuals were named as defendants: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people in the house when a car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured due to head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
At the beginning, he was placed in the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since that time, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh High Court as a person accused of murdering her son.
He is in custody, awaiting an indictment and trial, but the testimonies of eyewitnesses may be unreliable because her image has been widely publicized.
It is common practice in other regions of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system operates differently; the courts believe that publishing photographs may be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are entering dangerous territory by publishing photos of suspects, etc."
The Office of the Royal Prosecutor, generally responsible for conducting investigations, informed journalists that any further comments are withheld at least until an indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document will concern the disputed borders that Palestine wants to restore to the state before the Six-Day War in 1967.
According to reports, other topics under discussion concern the future status of Jerusalem, a holy city for both nations, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after signing the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to such a presence only for five years.
The shooters participating in the additional pest control test were to be closely supervised by foresters, as the test was monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.
As part of the partnership between NPWS and the Australian Sporting Shooters' Association (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters' Association hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, the director of protection and heritage of NPSW park, believes that the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive instructions in safety and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday in the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), which consists of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission requested the dissolution of the previous Interim Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to expedite new elections in the country.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime, which began in October.
Protests, sometimes taking a violent turn, were the aftermath of the lack of elections, which in some cases have been blocked since 2011.
Over 60 cases of iPods malfunctioning due to overheating were reported, which caused six fires and four people to suffer minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan stated that it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry stated that Apple reported 34 additional overheating incidents, describing them as "not serious."
When Apple postponed the release of the report, the ministry described the decision as "very unfortunate."
An earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (which is 9:19 p.m. Universal Time on Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management of the Northern Mariana Islands reported that the country did not suffer any damage.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there are no signs indicating a tsunami.
The bus with tourists from Hong Kong was hijacked in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, by a former Filipino policeman who took the passengers hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with an M16 rifle towards the tourists.
So far, several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead.
Filipino photographers and six hostages, including children and seniors, were released earlier.
Later, the photographers took the place of the old woman in need of a toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
Working in the hospital, Liggins used his free time to begin research on premature birth.
His study showed that the introduction of the hormone would accelerate the development of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua News Agency reported that on Wednesday government investigators managed to recover the black boxes.
The wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tomy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. She died on the night of the two moons, which was as extraordinary as she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Luna was as crazy as I was... or maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... one can only hope that she is better now."
Before the federal elections in 2010, a survey was conducted among 1,400 people, and the percentage of people opposed to introducing a republic system in Australia increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the campaign before the 2010 elections that, in her opinion, Australia should become a republic with the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of respondents agree with this and want Queen Elizabeth to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extreme points of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relays during the Commonwealth Games, but since he complained about his form, doubts arose about his expected results.
The medication necessary to combat the pain was banned by the games' regulations, so he couldn't take it.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor from the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
By the beginning of February, several people had confirmed the discovery using different equipment and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is hypothesized that comets delivered water to Earth along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and sustaining life.
Scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, and particularly what this process looked like in the case of Earth, because comets collided with it a long time ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo took office as governor at the beginning of this year and last month ratified a law legalizing same-sex marriages.
He described these rumors as "political gibberish and nonsense."
Speculation is being made that he will run for the office of president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that according to the FAA would enable aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
The use of satellite technology instead of older generation radar technology allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to provide pilots with more detailed information.
There will be no additional transport options, overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and furthermore, car parks and park-and-ride facilities will be unavailable in the overground space.
A potential lack of transport made it more likely that the match would be held behind closed doors without the team's fans.
The study published on Thursday in the journal Science reports on the emergence of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands, which belong to Ecuador.
Scientists from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have announced that a new species has emerged in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer based on the reproduction of Darwin's finches, black finches, cactus finches, and large ground finches.
Gold can be shaped into various forms, even the smallest ones.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be beaten or rolled into sheets.
It can be thinly spread and glued to another metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to adorn hand-painted illustrations in books, known as "illuminated manuscripts."
We call it the pH indicator of a chemical substance. Red cabbage juice has the ability to detect pH.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical substance is.
The pH level indicates the number of hydrogen ions (the letter "H" in the abbreviation "pH") contained in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of electrons (a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders, then use clean wet hands to squeeze them into a ball.
Moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a modern sewage system.
In the houses in Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece, remnants of a sewer system have been discovered.
Toilets were also known in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women would stay together.
When you call a person who is thousands of miles away from you, you use a satellite.
The connection reaches a satellite in outer space and then almost immediately bounces it back.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes placed in outer space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light, and thus the image visible from Earth.
Sending a satellite or telescope into space requires the use of a huge rocket over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in many amazing ways. Above all, it has enabled us to transport much more easily and quickly.
Without him, there would be no railways, cars, and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey: rabbits, antelopes, up to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic ones) that eat much more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in a niche, in a special task performed by each cat, which means it cannot compete with others.
Lions are among the most sociable cats and live in large prides.
A pride of lions consists of one, two, or three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming one large family of sisters and daughters.
Groups of lions exhibit behavior similar to a pack of wolves or a pack of dogs, which astonishingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in terms of behavior and the deadly threat they pose to their prey.
The tiger, a well-built athlete, can climb (although not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times better than a strong human.
The tiger, along with the lion, leopard, and jaguar, belongs to the genus Panthera. Only these four species of cats are capable of roaring.
The roar of a tiger is not as loud as a lion's, but it resembles more tangled, shouted words.
Ocelots enjoy small animals. Whenever possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Most of the ocelot's prey are much smaller in size than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat by scent.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision ability and move stealthily. They hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings, then pouncing on their target.
In the case of a small group of living beings (a small population) being separated from the main population from which they originate (e.g., when moving over a mountain range or river, or if they relocate to a new island without the possibility of easily retreating), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and various competitors, so the new population will have to develop new traits or adapt in such a way as to be able to compete effectively in the new surroundings.
The original population has not changed at all and still has to adapt in the same way.
Over time, as the new population adapts to the new environment, they resemble other populations less and less.
Ultimately, when thousands or even millions of years pass, these two populations will differ from each other to such an extent that it will be difficult to call them a single species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important element of it.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that people release (i.e., exhale).
Photosynthesis is the process in which plants use sunlight to produce nutrients. Plants also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants, just like our clothes. Most of our food is also plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator at the time, so it only feared other Mosasaurs.
In its elongated jaws, it had over 70 exceptionally sharp teeth, and additional teeth protruded from the palate, so its victims had no chance upon encountering it.
There is no complete certainty, but he might have had a forked tongue. He fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and might even have been a cannibal.
He did not hesitate to attack prey in the water and even a giant dinosaur like T. rex must have had respect for him.
Although we are well familiar with most of the dishes consumed by the Romans, their feasts also featured quite exotic dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and the European ground squirrel.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate their meals sitting on stools, while the rich met at banquets, during which they ate in a reclining position.
Dishes in ancient Rome could not contain ingredients that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They did not know, for example, corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
In Babylon, each of the deities had a main temple dedicated to it, which was considered its dwelling.
Offerings for the deities were brought by the people, while the role of the priests was to care for the divine needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, behind which was an inner sanctuary, accessible only to priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built, which became part of the temples.
A special sanctuary dedicated to the god was located at the top of the tower.
The house did not play a particularly significant role in the warm climate of the Middle East.
A larger part of Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
Women prepared food in the yards, and the shops were simple counters opening onto the street. Stones were used for building homes.
Since there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, the prices of wood were very high.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for committing murder, and during his westward journey, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Not diminishing his role as a discoverer, it must be noted that at that time the Eskimo tribes already inhabited this area.
Although each country could be described as "Scandinavian," Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differ from each other in terms of peoples, rulers, customs, and history.
If you have watched the movie "National Treasure," you might think that a map leading to the treasure is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it's not true. There are some inscriptions on the back of the document, but it is not a map leading to treasures.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" were written. The inscription is at the bottom of the document, written upside down.
Nobody knows for sure who wrote it, but it is known that at the beginning this large parchment document (measuring 29.75 by 24.5 inches) was pinned for storage.
In this context, it can be assumed that the annotation was added as a descriptive label.
The landings in Normandy and further clashes led to the liberation of the northern part of France, but the south was still under occupation.
Authority over this was held by the French "Vichy." These were individuals from France who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the aggressors instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies began the invasion of southern France, which was called "Operation Dragoon."
It took just two weeks for the forces of the USA and Free France to liberate southern France and head towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture, common to a fairly large group of people who live and work together as a society.
The word "civilization" originates from the Latin "civilis," meaning "civil," related to the word "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, which somewhat indicates the size of the community.
City-states were prototypes of nations. The culture of civilization presupposes the transmission of knowledge through many generations, leaving a lasting cultural footprint, and fair distribution.
Lesser cultures often disappear without leaving behind a significant historical record, so they cannot be considered true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially formed a fragile central government - whose sole component was the Congress - based on the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial body, it relied on state authorities, which were often unwilling to cooperate in enforcing all its laws.
Moreover, he did not have the authority to repeal interstate tax regulations and rates.
The articles required unanimous approval by all states before implementing any changes, whereas the states treated the central government with such disregard that their representatives often did not show up.
Alongside the German team, the Italian national football team ranks second in the world football rankings, and in 2006, they won the FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and athletes from Italy participate in international tournaments and the Olympic Games.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world.
Due to the cluster/groups of islands it possesses, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in a geographical sense.
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means beautiful island.
When the Dutch East India Company established a factory in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, it began implementing changes in indigenous grain production practices and employed Chinese to work on rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) took over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, having been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan to Japan, which would rule the island until 1945.
Within Machu Picchu, three main structures stand out: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
To better illustrate the original appearance of this place to visiting tourists, most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed.
By 1976, one-third of the city of Machu Picchu had been restored, and this process still continues.
For example, in photography, the most commonly used format is 35 mm, which is the most widespread film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but more importantly, this image format has been transferred to matrix formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, which is quite misleading.
The ratio for this format (we divide by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS format group) are identical or closely resemble this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds is often overused or mocked, but it serves as a simple guideline that helps achieve a dynamic effect without disrupting order.
He states that the ideal location for the main subject is the intersection point of the lines dividing the photo into three equal parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful and wealthy, came under close scrutiny.
For a period longer than one millennium, the Christian religion provided an essential bond between European countries that differed from each other in language and customs.
His power was so all-encompassing that it affected everyone, from the king to the peasant.
One of the main dogmas of Christianity states that wealth should be used to help the suffering and the poor, and that church funds are to be allocated specifically for this purpose.
The main ecclesiastical authority has been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money raises the question of whether this doctrine is being observed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy effectively cut off key military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated the generally accepted international law enshrined in several international agreements made in the previous two centuries.
The United Kingdom mined areas of international waters to block ships' access to vast parts of the ocean, putting even neutral vessels at risk.
This tactic met with a limited response, so the Germans expected a similar situation with their ruthless underwater warfare operations.
The 1920s were characterized by a stance of pacifism and isolation among most nations and citizens.
After the terrible and cruel experiences of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States due to work at the Edison Company in New York.
He set foot on American soil with 4 cents in his pocket, a volume of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods were uniquely represented; each era in China or each ruling family constituted a separate dynasty.
During the transitional periods of interregnum between the reigns of successive dynasties, the provinces fell into chaos and division. The Three Kingdoms period, spanning 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, is the most well-known such period.
Many dignitaries vying for the throne clashed in fierce battles during these periods.
The era of the Three Kingdoms is recorded in the history of ancient China as a time of great bloodshed; thousands lost their lives fighting for the supreme throne in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, e.g., the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, all male candidates had free access to professions, which allowed those who demonstrated the greatest ambition and resourcefulness to succeed.
The same applies to the military, as army ranks that were formerly based on classes are now based on the sword.
The French Revolution also served as an inspiration for many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond his ordinary life. He often went to contemplate in a cave known as "Hira" on "Noor" mountain (the mountain of light).
The preserved cave itself gives a very colorful idea of Muhammad's spiritual predilections.
The cave, situated at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the outside world.
It's not easy to find her at all, even when someone knows of her existence. Inside the cave, the visitor faces absolute isolation.
Nothing can be seen but the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, not much of the outside world can be seen or heard.
The only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still preserved today is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built in the 3rd century BCE, is one of many large pyramids erected in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
On the Giza Plateau (also known as the Giza Necropolis) in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Khufu), several smaller tombs, a few temples, as well as the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
The "up-bow" symbol looks like the letter "V," and the "down-bow" symbol resembles a paperclip or a square without the bottom side.
Up means to start from the tip and press the bow, and down means to start from the frog (the place where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow stroke from bottom to top generates a softer sound, while bowing from top to bottom produces a stronger, more assertive sound.
No worries, draw your own marks, but remember that the printed marks on the bow are there for musical reasons, so you should generally stick to them.
The crowd of enraged market women forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and Élisabeth, the king's sister, to return from Versailles to Paris.
As the king and queen returned to Paris in their carriage, they were accompanied by a jeering crowd hurling threats at them.
An enraged mob forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, a person from the crowd brandished the head of the guard killed at Versailles right in front of the terrified queen.
The imperialistic United States' war expenditures for the conquest of the Philippines were covered by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on bonds introduced to the stock exchange on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the great profits gained from the extended exploitation of the Filipinos would be the fundamental profits of U.S. imperialism.
The context in which the Knights Templar was created is essential for understanding its characteristics.
These events belong to the epoch commonly referred to as the Late Middle Ages, which encompassed the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries in the history of Europe (1000–1300 AD).
Before the High Middle Ages, there was the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism encompasses a wide range of ideas applied in practice, including the technological impulse or technological imperative, as well as the strict definition of human destiny directed by the hidden logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in the field of technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism are based on two general principles: firstly, the process of technology development itself is not influenced by cultural or political factors, and secondly, technology generates effects in societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
One could, for example, say that a motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of a road network.
Since a nationwide road network is not economically viable when the number of vehicles is minimal, new production methods are being developed to reduce vehicle operating costs.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in the number of road accidents, and consequently, to the invention of new medical methods for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a significant element of cultural determinism, which can be found in the writings of authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the individual was shaped by geography, and over time customs and culture associated with this geography developed, so consistent with the place of society that they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is renowned today as the contemporary capital of fashion, Constantinople was once regarded as the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
Its fame as a place of luxury began around the year 400 AD and lasted until the year 1000 AD.
His status declined in the 12th century, primarily because returning Crusaders brought back goods such as silks and spices, which were valued more than what was offered at Byzantine markets.
It was precisely then that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period of the 10th–11th and in the 14th century.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because the exchange of information was slow, Western styles could develop with a delay of 25–30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to shape its own style. One of the greatest achievements of those times, as a consequence of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming involves the farmer producing enough food to meet the needs of himself and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses seed self-sufficiency from an ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively easy methods to maximize efficiency.
In the past, most farmers met only their own needs, and this is still the case in many developing countries today.
Subcultures attract like-minded individuals who feel that social norms do not meet their needs, finding a sense of identity within the subculture.
Subcultures differ in terms of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
Distinguishing features of a subculture in its distinctiveness may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or may constitute a combination of various factors.
If someone is a member of a subculture, they demonstrate it through a distinctive and symbolic style that includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most popular ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during their growing up – whether due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate exploitation.
Such children are referred to as "wild" or "feral". Some of them were imprisoned (usually by their parents), and some were abandoned, because the parents were unable to come to terms with their child's severe mental or physical disability.
Before being abandoned or running away, feral children might have suffered from trauma or abuse.
It is supposed that some were raised by animals, and some allegedly live in the wild on their own.
If a feral child is cared for only by animals, it behaves almost entirely (considering physical limitations) like those very animals, exhibiting fear or indifference towards humans.
The project method should facilitate and make learning more attractive, while the scaffolding method takes it a step further.
The scaffolding method is not a way of learning, but rather the support provided to individuals who are engaging in new educational experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real, meaning the teacher is a kind of scaffolding, just like Clippy in the MS Office package.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized in the software and are intended to challenge, suggest, and explain procedures that may be challenging for a student to understand independently.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, such as neglect, abuse, and even coercion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that does not provide upbringing, care, and education, but unfortunately, it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to guarantee a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and good medical care.
The foster family is supposed to meet all the needs that were not being met in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet can be used for both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific properties of the Internet open new dimensions in terms of usage methods and approaches to gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "lasting relationships" were also identified by Eighemeya and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they examined audience responses to websites.
Video recordings have enabled significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial muscle movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that it is possible to detect if a person is lying by correctly reading their microexpressions.
In the article titled "The President's Speech" Oliver Sacks argues that people who, due to brain damage, do not understand speech are nevertheless able to correctly assess the sincerity of the speaker.
It even suggests that such skills in interpreting human behavior may also be possessed by animals, such as domestic dogs.
From scientific research conducted over the course of the twentieth century, it follows that there are two pools of genetic variability – one hidden, and the other expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, whereas selection removes variation from the pool of expressed genes.
With each generation, there is a mutual exchange of variability between the two pools through segregation and recombination.
Plants growing in the savannah make it difficult for primates with a digestive system like that of humans to meet their body's amino acid needs.
What's more, neglecting this may have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and pods, but for primates like us, they are difficult to digest without prior cooking.
It is different with animal food (ants, termites, eggs), which is easily digested and provides large amounts of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should be no surprise that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep interruption involves deliberately waking up during normal sleep and falling asleep again after 10–60 minutes.
It's not difficult if you use a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you back to consciousness but doesn't fully wake you up.
If it turns out that you are adjusting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, which will force you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based methods recommend consuming a large amount of fluids (especially water or diuretic tea) before going to sleep in order to have to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace is inversely proportional to a person's internal and physical tension.
The less stress there is, the more positive the life force is. Every person has the potential to find complete peace and satisfaction.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacles are our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but additionally includes the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In essence, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini yoga causes kundalini energy (i.e., enlightenment energy) to awaken through the practice of asanas, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
In the center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightenment awareness is created.
During World War II, the USA and the USSR allied against a common enemy, which was Germany. However, when the war ended, the radical clash of systems, processes, and cultures divided these two countries.
Two years had passed since the end of the war when former allies became enemies, which marked the beginning of the Cold War.
It was supposed to last for another 40 years and include real battles fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken; the sole hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans quickly became outdated when over 800,000 troops of the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading eastern Poland, thereby violating the provisions of the Treaty of Riga, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Transporting goods by ships is definitely the most efficient way of carrying large quantities of goods and people across oceans.
The task of the navy has always been to provide the country with the ability to transport people and goods while preventing the enemy from moving their people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign during World War II was one of the most notable examples in recent history. To help the British, the Americans attempted to transport people and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily utilizing submarines, attempted to block these transfers.
If the Allies had failed, the Germans would likely have succeeded in conquering Great Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
The domestication of goats likely occurred in the Iranian Zagros Mountains around 10,000 years ago.
People belonging to ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for their milk, wool, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often watched over by goat herders similar to shepherds, who were usually children or teenagers. These farming methods are still in use.
Railway tracks were being built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the tracks were built only with parallel wooden planks, the draught horses could move faster on them and transport larger loads than on the bumpy roads of the time.
Railway sleepers, on which the rails were mounted, appeared relatively early. However, it was gradually understood that in order to increase the efficiency of the tracks, iron strips should be installed on them.
It became a popular practice, but iron contributed to the greater wear of the wooden wagon wheels.
In the end, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In the year 1767, tracks made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known method of movement was walking; humans began to walk in an upright position two million years ago, hence the term Homo Erectus (upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, were not in the habit of walking upright.
Forms of bipedalism can be found in the fossils of australopithecines dated to 4.2–3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus moved on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start leading a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, we can join the ecological movement, and we can even take on the role of activists to contribute to reducing the scale of suffering in the future.
It often resembles symptomatic treatment. However, in order not to limit oneself to a temporary solution, it is necessary to identify the source of the problems and eliminate them.
It is obvious that the world has changed significantly due to scientific and technical advancements, and problems have been exacerbated due to overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
When on July 4th the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress, its handwritten version signed by John Hancock, the President of Congress, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few streets away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The document was publicly read for the first time by John Nixon at the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who instructed it to be read to his troops on July 9 in New York. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 still existing Dunlap broadsides are the oldest copies of the document that have survived. The handwritten original did not survive.
Many paleontologists claim that one group of dinosaurs has survived to this day. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are still many things in birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs, just like a T-Rex.
Actually, all currently used computers are based on the manipulation of information encoded as a binary system.
A binary number can have a value of 0 or 1, and such numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning does not have to reveal itself immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that they do not provide a basis for an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of poisoning is the presence of an open package with medication or toxic household chemicals.
Familiarize yourself with the instructions on the label to learn how to administer first aid in the case of this specific poisoning.
The name "bug" is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from ancient times, which were familiar with bedbugs, insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs are nest-dwellers, adapted to living in the nest or home of the host.
In the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis have been registered, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that attacks the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
According to the results of conducted research, the risk of multiple sclerosis is twice as high in women as in men.
The couple may decide that raising the child is not in their interest or the child's interest.
These couples can decide to prepare an adoption plan for their child.
Adoption involves the biological parents relinquishing their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The overarching goal that science sets for itself is to discover the mechanism of how the world works through the scientific method. Most scientific research is based on this method.
However, this is not the only method; an experiment is a test that allows one or more possible hypotheses to be rejected. Asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin translation, formed the basis of studies conducted by naturalists and philosophers.
The views of Aristotle were accepted in all scientific matters, including psychology.
As the knowledge of the Greek language diminished, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often fundamentally depend on the existence of endogenous cycles and their creation by biological clocks.
Cyclical rhythms that are not merely reactions to external periodic stimuli have been documented with respect to most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that persist through entire cycles, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used the same bacteriophages or viruses to inject bacteria with their own DNA.
Two experiments were conducted, one labeling the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus, and the other labeling the phage protein using radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects, depending on their type, the significance of the genetic material element involved, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children; mutations in other areas can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts individuals interested in visiting natural areas, admiring landscapes, including vegetation and wildlife.
Sample on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, as well as visits to parks and gathering information about the ecosystem.
An example could be visiting Borneo, photographing and gathering information about orangutans.
Every morning, people leave their small towns by car and go to work, passing those who are heading to the places they just left.
As part of this dynamic shuttle transport, everyone in some way participates in and supports the transportation system based on private vehicles.
Currently, science indicates that the vast carbon economy has caused the biosphere to be displaced from its stable state, which for two million years supported human evolution.
Everyone is a participant in social life and uses transportation. Almost everyone complains about transportation.
In developed countries, such complaints about water quality or bridge collapses are rarely heard.
Why are there so many complaints about the transportation systems, and why are there irregularities in their functioning every day? Are the engineers responsible for them just mere bunglers? Or does the problem lie much deeper?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
It is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with absolute certainty, so unfortunately, studying traffic flow poses difficulties.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers falls within a fundamentally consistent range; thus, traffic streams also exhibit a certain consistency and can be approximately represented using mathematical calculations.
The relationships among the three key properties, namely (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed, allow for a better illustration of traffic movement.
Planning, designing, and operating road facilities utilize such relationships.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. The ability to fly allowed them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects have the useful ability to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a greater choice of small hiding places from predators.
Today, the only insects that lack the ability to fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
There were those who believed he was right, while others held the opposite view, namely that the solar system, along with the Sun and other stars, revolves around the Earth.
It makes sense because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and the largest river in the world, carrying 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, and in some places, its width is nearly 6 miles.
The Amazon accounts for 20% of the river waters flowing into the oceans on Earth.
The Amazon River in its main course is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of small tributaries.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom period, the size and technical perfection of the pyramids in Giza were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period looked with admiration at the structures of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old at the time.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, as well as the country with the smallest population.
In its legislation and official communications, the Vatican uses the Italian language.
Most people working in this country use Italian in their daily lives, while Latin can often be heard during religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are of the Roman Catholic faith.
Even in ancient times, people knew basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper because they are present in nature in their natural form and can be relatively easily extracted using simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed the theory that everything is a combination of at least one of the four elements. They were: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in that specific order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized about their transformation into new substances that shape what we see.
An alloy can be defined as a mixture of two or more metals. It should be remembered that the periodic table contains many elements.
Calcium and potassium are elements considered to be metals. Of course, silver and gold are also classified as metals.
There may also be alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. Matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so unimaginably microscopic that the dot at the end of this sentence could contain trillions of them.
So when the pencil appeared, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of newer writing methods, the pencil has lost its status and frequency of use.
People now write messages using computer screens and do not need pencil sharpeners at all.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer appears.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing a heavy cart uphill. A splitting of the nucleus releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei that decay with little or no disturbance.
The surface of the Moon is covered with rocks and dust. The outer layer of the planet is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
On the visible side, there may be more areas of maria because the crust is thinner here, making it easier for lava to break through to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what appeals to and resonates with people.
These theories assume that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been acquired during the maturation process into adulthood.
These theories relate to what makes some people want what they do and what in their environment makes them do certain things and not others.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when managers begin to lead their former colleagues, two types of behavior may occur. One of them is the attempt to remain "one of the team."
This type of manager is reluctant to make unpopular decisions, avoids disciplinary actions, and shies away from performance evaluations, task assignments, and holding people accountable for their work.
The other extreme is an unrecognizable transformation into someone who feels they must change everything the team has done so far, making it conform to their own vision.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the successes and failures of the team.
Such behavior often results in friction between the leaders and the other team members.
In the case of virtual teams, the same standards of excellence apply, but there are minor differences.
Members of a virtual team often serve as a point of contact for a physically associated group.
They often have more freedom than regular team members because their teams can hold meetings according to different time zones, which the local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
„Invisible group” is the management team to which all members are subordinate. The invisible group sets standards for each member.
Why would a company want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing the learning organization concept is innovation.
Creativity and inventiveness flourish when all available resources are effectively utilized in the functional departments of the organization.
As a result, collaboration within the organization to overcome obstacles can lead to the creation of an innovative process that meets customer needs.
For the organization to become innovative, its management must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that helps organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to studying cognition. This narrows the research area and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and conduct supports ongoing scientific research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, traumas, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in mental functions.
Thanks to new technologies, we can observe and study previously unknown brain structures and processes occurring within it.
We draw a lot of information and materials from here to build simulation models, which allow us to better understand what happens in the human mind.
Although artificial intelligence is closely associated with science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research on artificial intelligence involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligence.
Examples include control and planning, the ability to respond to customers' statements and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
These things have become separate fields, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is often used today in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and military technology, and it also appears as an embedded element in several applications used in personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an essential part of every class. It often happens that the teacher would eagerly take her students to places where buses do not reach.
Technology provides the opportunity for virtual field trips. Students can see museum collections, visit aquariums, or admire works of art while sitting in their classroom.
By offering a virtual field trip, it is possible to stimulate reflections about it and share experiences with subsequent classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; every year the site is changed, but the old versions remain online as an album.
Blogs can help students make progress in writing. Often at the beginning of blogging, grammar and spelling are not at the highest level, but the presence of readers usually changes that.
The blogger is starting to make efforts to improve the quality of their texts and avoid criticism because students often pass the harshest judgments.
Moreover, blogging "makes students better understand the world around them." The need to respond to the interests of the audience inspires students to provide intelligent and interesting content (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Thanks to proper use of blogs, "students can become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online posts, they can define their position in relation to the work of others and outline their own perspective on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada, with many art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
South of here lies Niagara Falls, and to the north, one can discover the untouched beauty of the Muskoka district and surrounding regions.
All these things – and more – clearly indicate that Ontario is considered by outsiders as the essence of Canada.
Vast areas further north are sparsely populated, some of them are practically deserted wilderness.
This comparison of populations surprises many people: the number of African Americans living in the United States exceeds the number of Canadian citizens.
East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean to the east of the African coast.
Madagascar is undoubtedly the largest and, due to its nature, constitutes a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or allied with France and are renowned as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, which definitely took root in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European explorations and colonialism emerged in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, it is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that every woman traveling presents herself as married regardless of her actual marital status.
Wearing a ring also helps (as long as it doesn't look too expensive).
Women should know that cultural differences can lead to behaviors that they consider harassment, such as often being followed, grabbed by the hands, etc.
Firmly refuse men and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences do not mean it has to be this way!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and served the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed them and rebuilt them under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned them after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru-I-Badya, and the Spanish merchants, who had trading posts there, called it Casablanca.
When it comes to shopping, Casablanca is at the bottom in all of Morocco.
Within the old Medina, you can easily buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather products, water pipes, and a whole variety of different trinkets; however, this offering is typically intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located at the eastern end of the country near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed when the Nyiragongo volcano erupted, and lava buried most of the city's streets, especially its center.
While Goma is quite safe, all visits outside its area should be previously investigated for the state of fighting ongoing in the North Kivu province.
From the city, one can set out to climb Mount Nyiragongo, as well as to track mountain gorillas, which is one of the cheapest options for this attraction in Africa here.
It is possible to use motorcycle taxis (so-called boda-boda) to get around Goma. The standard (local) price for a short ride is about 500 Congolese francs.
In the context of its relatively difficult accessible location, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Currently, Timbuktu is an impoverished city; nevertheless, its reputation attracts tourists, and there is also an airport there.
In 1990, the city was placed on the list of endangered world heritage sites due to the damage caused by desert sands.
It was one of the main stops in Henry Louis Gates's special program on PBS television, "Wonders of the African World."
This city is definitely different from the rest of the cities in the country because it has a more Arabic than African climate.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and is defined by the Crocodile River to the south.
The area of the park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each characterized by distinct flora and fauna.
It is one of the biggest attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship among national parks in South Africa (SANParks).
Fees for daily conservation and park entry apply here, as in all other South African national parks.
Purchasing a wild card can be beneficial as it allows entry to selected parks in Southern Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from Hong Kong Island, which is the main attraction for many tourists.
Tightly packed rows of buildings forming the skyline of Hong Kong have been compared to a gleaming bar chart accentuated by the surface of Victoria Harbour.
The best views of Hong Kong are offered by the Kowloon waterfront opposite the city.
A large majority of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is a place occupied by British colonizers, so it's worth starting here to look for traces of the colonial past of this territory.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and parts of India.
The Sundarbans have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest located in the territory of India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps – they are also the last remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about one third is covered by water and marshes.
Since 1966, Sundarban has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that 400 royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 chital deer live there now.
Buses depart from the interregional bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most leave between 6:30 and 7:30, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang.
It's better to buy a ticket a few days in advance, as buses running between districts are often crowded.
Most districts are serviced by small Japanese waterfront buses, comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient means of transportation to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that facilitates communication between the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters, its length is 378 meters, and it has two traffic lanes with a width of 3.5 meters.
The vertical clearance of the bridge is 15 meters. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened for use until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be ready for use in September 2017, when the completion of the Brazilian customs posts is expected.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in the region of present-day eastern Paraguay, leading a semi-nomadic life as hunters and engaging in agriculture to meet their own needs.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, which survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "great province of the Indies," was established in the 16th century as a result of clashes between Spanish conquistadors and groups of indigenous inhabitants.
The Spaniards initiated a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and the best players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
In other months, you can also come across tournaments and competitions organized on a smaller scale.
The Asociación Argentina de Polo offers more information about tournaments and tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
Throughout the islands, payments in British pounds are generally accepted, credit cards can be used in Stanley, and it is often possible to pay in US dollars as well.
Do not count on card payment when staying on the farthest islands, although British and American currency may be accepted; it's best to ask the owners in advance about the form of payment.
It is nearly impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so it is advisable to exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer prevails there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, which means that temperatures often exceed +30°C in the summer months.
Winter can be more freezing than it seems: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but combined with wind and humidity, the feeling of cold is greater than what the thermometer shows.
There are no "dry" and "rainy" seasons; the amount of rainfall is basically the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park have become accustomed to the sight of people, they are still wild, so they must not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
Although they may seem gentle, bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a safe distance. These are large, wild, and potentially dangerous animals that need space.
Additionally, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking aromatic foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and inhabited by just under 40,000 people.
In the 1850s, the city of Apia was founded, which became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
This is where the infamous naval standoff occurred in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the fight for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city ended with the killing of the main leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland stretches between two bays, so there are plenty of beaches here, and the most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the northern coast (in the North Harbour district) are by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy, with safe swimming areas, and on most of them, shade is provided by metrosideros trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They are often crowded family beaches with a wide selection of shops lining the waterfront. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One," which is not a complicated beer but pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is "Manta".
It's worth stocking up on various French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines might withstand travel better.
You can drink tap water here without any worries, but if anyone has doubts, bottled water is easy to find.
The concept of a "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians. A small black is an "espresso," cappuccino is filled to the brim with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are quite expensive, but they are excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place year-round, and injuries on the reef caused by any of these reasons are rare.
However, heed the advice of the authorities, comply with all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April, north of 1770. Sometimes they can also be encountered outside this period.
No one denies the existence of sharks, but attacks on humans are rare. Most of these creatures feel fear when encountering a human and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not lead an active life in the oceans; their primary habitat is river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance ensures that the traveler does not have to worry about having a place to sleep upon reaching their destination.
Travel agencies usually cooperate with specific hotels, although it is possible to book another form of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
In travel agency offers, we will find packages that include breakfast, airport transfer, as well as combined flight and hotel packages.
The reservation can be extended for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents needed at your destination (e.g., visa).
Any corrections or requests should be directed first to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of music festivals, the vast majority of participants choose to camp on site, and most of them consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be near the action, you need to arrive early to find a campsite close to the music.
It should be noted that even after the musical performances on the main stages have ended, music will continue to play in some festival sectors until late into the night.
Some festivals offer camping areas designed for families with small children.
When crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as the journey through the ice generates terrible noise for those most affected.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise ship passengers are not required to have visas (conditions should be checked).
Casinos generally aim for their guests to stay as long as possible and leave as much money as possible. Hence the lack of windows and clocks, and the exit is hard to find.
They usually have special offers that include meals, drinks, and entertainment to ensure guests have a good time and keep them staying.
Some venues offer alcoholic drinks on the house, but intoxication impairs judgment, and all seasoned gamblers know the value of a sober mind.
When traveling in a vehicle at high latitudes or through mountain passes, it's important to consider conditions such as snow, ice, and below-freezing temperatures.
On roads covered with ice and snow, there is little friction, so it's impossible to drive as you would on clean asphalt.
During a blizzard, snow can accumulate so quickly that the road becomes impassable.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow or drops or ice on the car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, where traffic moves without major obstacles throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important event for many visitors.
The popular use of the term safari refers to land journeys undertaken to admire the stunning African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and the standard equipment allows for appropriate viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be skittish, so it's better to observe them through binoculars.
A walking safari ("bush walk") can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will begin on August 24 and will last until September 5, 2012. Some events will be hosted in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to host the Summer Olympics twice (the first time was in 1964).
If you booked a flight and accommodation for the year 2020 before the announcement of the date change, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Appeal rules vary, but by the end of March, most appeals caused by the coronavirus do not include July 2020, when the Olympic Games were supposed to take place.
As expected, the prices of most event tickets will range from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, while the typical ticket price will be around 7,000 yen.
Ironing can speed up the drying of damp clothes. Many hotels lend irons and ironing boards if they are not included in the room's amenities.
If you don't have an iron or you don't care about wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if it's available.
The fabric must not be overheated, as it may shrink or scorch in extreme cases.
Water can be purified in many ways, and some of them are more effective at combating specific threats.
Depending on the area, you need to boil the water for one minute or a few minutes.
Filters have varying efficiency, so if you have concerns, consider purchasing bottled water from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers may encounter pest animals that are not found in their native regions.
Pests destroy food, cause irritations or, in worse cases, allergic reactions, secrete venom, and transmit infections.
Usually, infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people are not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping provides an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in specific locations.
Travelers visiting countries with particularly high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on goods such as alcohol and tobacco.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, the most difficult section for drivers lies between Point Marion and Fairmont, often crossing remote forested areas.
If you're not accustomed to driving on country roads, keep your eyes wide open, as you'll often encounter steep inclines, narrow sections, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than those in effect on the preceding and subsequent sections (usually 35–40 mph, or 56–64 km/h), and strict adherence to them is of exceptional importance.
However, it is interesting to note that the cellular network here has a much stronger signal than on many other sections of this route, for example, in the Pennsylvania Wilds region.
German pastries are quite tasty, and the Bavarian ones are notable for their heartiness and variety, similar to those in Austria, which borders Bavaria to the south.
Baked goods with fruit are very popular: those with cooked apples are available year-round, while those with cherries and plums are available in the summer.
Many German pastries include almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cookies often pair especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but nutritious dish, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices served with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "moist" depending on the amount of liquid.

Because there are as many as 17,000 islands, the term Indonesian cuisine encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines from across the country.
The term, without additional clarifying descriptors, usually refers to the cuisine typical of the central and eastern areas of Java, which is the most important island in the region.
Javanese cuisine, now easily accessible throughout the archipelago, features simply seasoned dishes, and the favorite accompaniments of the Javanese are peanuts, chili peppers, and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are the rider's foot supports that hang on each side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with greater stability, but they can raise safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and their foot gets stuck in the stirrup, the fleeing horse may drag them. Various safety measures can be taken to minimize the risk of such an event.
First and foremost, most jockeys wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, particularly English ones, are equipped with safety features that cause the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle if a rider falling backwards pulls on them.
Cochamó Valley – the most important climbing location in Chile, referred to as the Yosemite of South America, offering a variety of large granite walls and spires.
From the summits, spectacular views stretch out. Climbers from all over the globe continue to establish new routes among the walls, offering countless possibilities.
Winter sports such as downhill skiing or snowboarding are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is the main activity on trips for many enthusiasts, sometimes called "skiing fanatics," who plan entire vacations around skiing in a given location.
Skiing has a very long history - as early as 5000 BC, silhouettes of skiers were painted on cave walls!
Alpine skiing as a sport discipline dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski resort in Australia.
Ski tours: this activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski excursions.
One can notice certain similarities to alpine skiing and climbing, but unlike them, the route does not pass through steep terrain and sturdier skis and boots are not needed.
Think of a ski route as similar to a hiking trail.
Under favorable conditions, you can cover slightly longer distances than when hiking on foot, but only in rare cases will you reach running speeds, and that is provided you are without a heavy backpack and the route is properly prepared.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to apply for many visas and undergoing many passport controls.
In this respect, the Schengen Area functions to some extent like a single country.
As long as you remain in this zone, you generally can cross borders without having to go through passport control points again.
Similarly, holding a Schengen visa means you don't have to submit a separate visa application for each of the Schengen member countries, which saves time and money and reduces paperwork.
There is no single universal definition that determines which human artifacts should be considered antiques. Some tax agencies classify any items over 100 years old as antiques.
This definition depends on the geographical location, the age limit may be lower in North America than in Europe.
Crafts can be called antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Many Sámi people earn their living from reindeer husbandry, and the culture associated with this industry is also important for people in other professions.
A traditional occupation that the Sámi people have had and still have is not only large-scale reindeer herding but also fishing, hunting, etc., with reindeer mainly serving as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern sectors. Tourism is an important branch of the economy in Lapland, where the Sámi live.

When planning a trip to a country considered a war zone, one must undergo professional training.
When searching the Internet for the term "Hostile Environment Course," you are likely to find the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the issues discussed here, in much more detail and combined with practice.
Typically, the course lasts from 2 to 5 days, and it includes role-playing exercises, a lot of first aid classes, and sometimes weapon training.
Numerous books and magazines on survival art are widely available, whereas publications concerning war zones are very few.
People who are planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must have valid documents for their return journey.
Governments have varying approaches to issuing passports without a specified gender marker (X) or updating names and gender on documents according to applicants' wishes.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents is just as varied.
Moreover, after September 11, 2001, security control guards began conducting much more rigorous searches.
Before surgery, transgender individuals should not expect that their privacy and dignity will not be violated during scans.
Rip currents are created by waves breaking on a beach, reef, or similar barrier.
The underwater topology causes the return flow to occur mainly at several deeper levels, where a fast current directed towards the deep waters can form.
Death most often occurs as a result of exhaustion caused by trying to swim against the current, which is not always possible.
As soon as you manage to get out of the current, swimming back shouldn't be any harder than usual.
Try to head to a place where you won't get caught in the current again, or wait for a rescue operation, taking into account your skills and whether someone has noticed you.
Reverse culture shock comes faster than cultural shock (the "honeymoon period" is shorter), lasts longer, and can have more serious consequences.
Tourists who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes experience exceptional difficulty readjusting to their native culture.
Returning home after living abroad, you are accustomed to a new culture and have shed some habits related to your national culture.
During your first trips abroad, people probably treated you with patience and understanding, knowing that a traveler arriving in a foreign country must adapt.
People often do not foresee that travelers returning home must also demonstrate patience and understanding.
The light and sound show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions for the local kids.
You can watch the pyramids after dark and in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you can hear the sounds of tourists and vendors here all the time. The story told through sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx serves as the background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and various pyramids are illuminated.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are claimed by several countries and host the largest number of bases, of which sixteen were operational in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas, has the largest area of them all.
Other ones are Livingstone Island and Deception Island, where the water-filled caldera of an still active volcano forms a picturesque natural bay.
Ellsworth Land is located north of the Peninsula and is surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula converge here into a plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth mountain range, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range, there are the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak reaching a height of 4892 m.
In remote places where there is no mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone generally cannot replace a mobile phone because you need to go outside and have good satellite visibility to connect.
The service is often used in shipping, including recreational vessels, and during expeditions that require remote data and voice services.
Your local telecommunications service provider should provide more information about this service.
Among people planning a year-long break, travel and learning options are becoming increasingly popular.
It is a popular option among school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before starting university without any detriment to their education.
Often participating in an annual course abroad can significantly improve the chances of obtaining higher education in one's home country.
Usually, a tuition fee is charged for enrolling in these educational programs.
Finland offers ideal conditions for boat vacations. This "land of a thousand lakes" is also rich in islands, with thousands found on the lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
On archipelagos and lakes, a yacht is not necessarily required.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are appropriately large for all yachts, smaller boats or even kayaks provide different experiences.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland, with one in seven or eight people owning a boat.
A similar statistical indicator is indeed found in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it is still an exceptional result compared to countries like the Netherlands, where there is one boat for every forty citizens.
An extended stay in Saint Petersburg is featured in the itinerary of most Baltic cruises.
This means that you can explore the historic city for a few days and return to the ship at night.
If you go ashore only during ship excursions, you do not need a separate visa (situation as of 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin in their itinerary. The above map clearly shows that Berlin is not located by the sea or nearby, so a visit to this city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages, especially if they haven't flown before or have had a traumatic event.

Some people are able to overcome the fear of the unknown or the lack of control if they learn about the principles of how an airplane operates and the mechanisms involved in flight.
Courier companies earn well from fast deliveries. Often, time plays a crucial role when it comes to business documentation or goods or spare parts required for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but this was problematic with regard to other routes and smaller companies.
If they were shipping packages by air, unloading and customs clearance on some routes could take many days.
The only way to send it faster is to check it in as registered baggage. According to airline regulations, luggage cannot be sent without a passenger, and that is your task.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a significant amount of money for the privilege (or – even better – have your company do it for you).
However, it is an expensive option: generally, we pay four times more for a business class ticket than for a standard economy class, and for first class, as much as eleven times more!
Basically, it is not worth spending time looking for discounts on business class or first class seats for direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain consistent group of travelers who are willing to pay any amount to reach their destination quickly and comfortably, and they take this into account when setting prices.
Chișinău is the capital of Moldova, where the local language is Romanian, although Russian is also in common use.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic experiencing ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but UN member states do not recognize it.
Despite the unsuccessful political negotiations, economic ties between the two parts of Moldova were restored.
Orthodoxy is the dominant religion in Moldova.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million, it is also the second largest port, after Istanbul, as well as a very good transportation hub.

We will find rare animal species there, such as the European bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, along with many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must have their knees and shoulders covered.
In most monasteries, inappropriately dressed women are given a scarf, but it's worth having your own, especially a brightly colored one, to see a smile on the face of a monk or nun at the entrance to the temple.
The same requirement applies to men, who must wear trousers that cover the knees.
Men can also borrow scarves covering their knees at the entrance, but they are not washed regularly, so not everyone will feel comfortable wearing such a scarf. For men, one size fits all!
The basis of cuisine in Majorca, as in other similar areas of the Mediterranean Sea, is bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) as well as olive oil.

All nouns are written with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence, including the word "Sie," which is a polite form meaning "Mr./Mrs./Ms./Mr. and Mrs.".
This is an important method that allows distinguishing some predicates from complements.
It can be said that this also facilitates reading, although there are difficulties in writing because one has to determine whether the verb or adjective is used in a nominal form.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple – most words are pronounced as they are written.

People who know even a little Spanish can quickly determine that Portuguese is so similar that there is no need to learn it separately.
Observatories from pre-modern times are now obsolete and are being converted into museums or educational centers.
Because the mild pollution during their heyday wasn't as much of an issue as it is now, they are usually located in cities or campuses, making them more accessible than those built in contemporary times.
Most modern research telescopes are large devices located in remote places where favorable atmospheric conditions prevail.
The custom of admiring cherry blossoms, called hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The idea originated in China, where plum blossoms were the most popular.
In Japan, the emperor organized the first cherry blossom viewing parties exclusively for himself and other aristocrats of the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to pick "just one" specimen.

Christmas, commemorating the coming of Jesus into the world, is one of the most important Christian holidays.
Non-believers in Christian countries and people of other faiths around the world have incorporated many traditions that have developed around these holidays into their lives.
According to a certain tradition, the Easter night is spent keeping vigil in an open place and waiting for the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could just as well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
Churches with a more traditional approach celebrate the Easter Vigil liturgy on the evening of Holy Saturday, and the faithful often begin to celebrate the resurrection of Christ when the clock strikes midnight.
All the animals that were the first to arrive on the island swam here, flew here, or arrived floating on the water.
The distance from the continent was so great that mammals were unable to reach there, which led to the giant tortoise becoming the primary species living on the Galapagos.
As soon as humans arrived in the Galapagos, numerous mammals appeared there, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you go to the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will experience the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
