This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widely spread theory, but also provides details that are usually impossible to obtain from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal is light or carotenoid-colored on top with a chestnut color underneath.
Research also enables a deep understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
The dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, known as the rachis, but they had other characteristics of feathers, such as barbs and barbules. Researchers speculated that the rachis might have evolved after these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but only for temperature regulation or display. Although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, researchers have indicated that it looks like aged feathers but not under a hen.

The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhooth Kanjar, Rampuro Kanjar, Gaja Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The accused appeared in court with a face mask, according to a top police official, Chandra Shekhar Solanki.
Even though three people were in the house when the car hit, no one was injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred has been temporarily closed and emergency services have extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He initially joined the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, she has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court regarding the charges of her son's murder.
She is in custody pending charges and trial, but since her picture has been widely published, direct evidence may be tainted.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice operates differently, and the courts have regarded publishing photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee stated, "It seems journalists are treading on a dangerous path if they publish photos of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that it will make no further comment until at least an accusation is made.
According to the document leak, it refers to the border dispute, which Palestine sought based on the borders before the 1967 Mid-East war.
Regarding these reports, the future of Jerusalem as a kingdom, which is sacred to both countries, also includes the issue of the Jordan Valley.
After an agreement was made, while Israel wanted to continue military operations in the valley for 10 years, the PA agreed to continue such operations for only 5 years.
Rangers must closely monitor the shooters in the related pest control trial, as the trial is supervised and its impact assessed.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, eligible volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Acting Director Park NPWS with Conservation and Heritage Mick O'Flynn, four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday to the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) formed with 9 members.
For the fifth consecutive time in the past 4 years, Martelly was appointed as a member of the CEP.
As part of the package of measures to steer the country towards new elections, the commission recommended the early resignation of the president last month.
This commission was established by Martelly in response to the administrative protests that have erupted since last October.
Sometimes violent protests erupt when conducting elections fails, some since 2011.
English sentence: 60 cases have been reported where iPods failed due to excessive heating. Among these, up to 6 caught fire, and 4 people were slightly injured.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan has stated that it is aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them about an additional 34 overheating incidents, which the company described as 'non-serious.'"
The Ministry described the postponing of the Apple report as "truly unfortunate."
An earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office stated that there was no damage in the country.
Similarly, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there are no tsunami advisories.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued and so far at least 6 people have been confirmed dead.
The six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released like Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an old woman who needed a necessary lavatory. Mendoza was incinerated.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature complications in his spare time.
His research found that if the hormone can be controlled, it can accelerate the growth of the baby's fetal lungs.
The investigators on behalf of the government retrieved 2 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday, as reported by Xinhua.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tributes to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "The first queen of Luna Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. She was as uniquely special as she was strong."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was as strange as me... even more... I love her and miss her... hopefully, she will be in a good place."
Among the 1,400 polled before the 2010 Federal Election, those opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard mentioned that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled expressed this opinion, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to remain as Australia's last monarch.
Among those surveyed, 29% believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% opined that Australia should never become a republic.
Olympic gold medalist is scheduled to swim in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and 3 relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness is in doubt due to the complaints against him.
Since he was banned from games, he couldn't take the necessary medication to overcome his pain.
A mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, Curtis Cooper, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
In early February, several people verified the innovation using various hardware and software and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may have potentially contributed to Earth's water supply along with organic materials, which produce proteins and aid in the existence of life.
Scientists are trying to understand how planets formed, especially how Earth formed, because long ago comets collided with Earth.
Earlier this year, 53-year-old Kumo assumed the office of Governor and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriages.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense talk."
In 2016, it was anticipated that he would run for the presidency.
The NextGen system, which the FAA claims allows aircraft to travel shorter distances, saves millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduces carbon emissions.
Air traffic controllers use satellite-based technology as opposed to the old ground-radar-based technology to pinpoint aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more precise information.
There is no additional transportation and overground trains do not stop near Wembley, and also car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available near the ground.
The fears related to the lack of transportation have provided the opportunity to play the game behind closed doors without team supporters.
The study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that these new species emerged in just two generations, although they believed the process would take much longer, due to interbreeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can work in all kinds of shapes. It can be molded into small shapes.
It can be pulled into thin wires, it can be wrapped and knotted. It can be flattened with a hammer or rolled into sheets.
"This can be made very thin and can adhere to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books referred to as 'illuminated manuscripts'."
This is called the pH of a solution. An indicator can be made using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether a solution is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level indicates the total amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms contain 1 proton and 1 electron).
Mix the two powders, then with clean wet hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands interacts with the outer layers, making them appear strange and resemble a kind of shell.
Harappa and Mohenjo-daro towns had almost every house connected to an advanced sewage system with flushable toilets.
Remnants of sewage systems have been discovered in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women would mingle together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists are using telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
It takes a huge rocket 100 feet tall to place a satellite or a telescope in space.
The wheel changed the world in a remarkable way. The greatest thing the wheel did for us is providing very easy and fast transportation.
This brought us trains, cars, and many other transportation devices.
Under them, there are medium-sized felines that eat bait-like rabbits to blackbucks and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats) that eat a variety of small prey such as insects, mice, and birds.
The secret to their success is a unique task that keeps each cat from competing with others.
Lions are mostly social cats, and they live in large groups called prides.
Thirty female lions and cubs, along with 1 to 3 male lions, come together to form prides.
Since it is a large family with sisters and daughters, female animals usually have a close relationship with each other.
Lions behave surprisingly like animals with the pride of lions, like packs of jackals or dogs (but not other big cats), and they work very lethally for their hunt.
The athlete, who is quite round, can climb like a tiger (though not very well), swim, leap long distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
Tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars belong to the same group (genus Panthera). Only these four cats can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the roar filled with the voice of a lion, it is like a sentence with that throat, it roars loudly.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds when possible. Almost all the animals hunted by an ocelot are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that predatory animals catch their prey (food) by their scent, and they detect the smell of a location on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision and move quietly without making a sound. They blend into the surroundings of the forest, hunt their prey, and then feast on it.
A small group of organisms (a small population) when separated from the main population (if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island and cannot easily return) seem to be in an environment different from before.
In this new environment, there will be diverse resources and different competitors, so the new population will require various features or adaptations to be stronger competitors than before.
The actual population has not changed at all; they still need the same guidance as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to appear less and less like other populations.
Finally, after thousands or a few millions of years, as the two populations will no longer be referred to as the same species, they will appear very different.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable evolution and a very important part of the evolutionary process.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide released by humans (i.e., exhalation).
Plants prepare food through photosynthesis using sunlight. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Animals cannot survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, fearing nothing except its fellow mosasaurs.
Its long jaws are lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set mounted on the top of its mouth, leaving no chance of escape when it comes its way.
We are not sure, but it might have a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have also been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that came into the water; even a large dinosaur like T. rex would not match it.
Although we know a lot about Roman food, the Romans consumed novel or unusual delicacies in their diet, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a kind of dormouse.
Another difference is that while poor people, women, were sitting on chairs and eating, the rich preferred to dine together in feasts.
In the following centuries, ancient Roman food did not include the foods that came to Europe from America or Asia.
For example, they never tasted corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and an ancient Roman would never have tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the abode of that deity.
People bring offerings to the deities, and priests try to fulfill the needs of the deities through rituals and festivals.
Every temple used to have an outer temple courtyard and an inner sanctum/sanctuary, where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, towers called ziggurats, which are pyramid-shaped, were constructed as part of temples.
There is a special sacred place for the deity at the top of the tower.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house is not that important.
In the Hebrew family, many lived their lives outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard. The shops were merely open counters. Stone was used for house construction.
In Canaan, there are no large forests, so wood is very expensive there.
Greenland used to have a low population. Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland due to committing murder, and later while traveling westward, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of what he discovered, the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Even though every country is considered 'Scandinavian,' there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is written behind the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even if something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words written behind the declaration of independence are "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." The words at the bottom of the document appear upside down.
Though no one knows who wrote this, it has been known for a long time, rolled up to store a large parchment document (measuring 29¬æ inches x 24¬Ω inches).
Therefore, notation can be added just like a label.
D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south has yet to gain freedom.
This was under the """"Vichy"""" French regime. They made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked southern France, and this expedition was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just 2 weeks, the Americans and Free French Forces liberated southern France and turned their journey towards Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a significantly large group that coexists and works together in a society.
The word 'civilization' comes from the Latin civilis, which relates to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it can also in some sense define the size of society.
City-states were the predecessors of countries. Civilization culture implies imparting knowledge to many generations, spreading long-lasting cultural markers equally.
Small cultures often disappear without a trace of historical reference and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War period, the thirteen states - with Congress as their sole component - initially established a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress does not have the power to levy taxes. As there is no national executive body or judiciary, it relied on government officials.
It does not have the authority to abolish tax laws and duties between states.
Consensus from all states is required before amending these articles. The central government representatives have frequently been absent.
The Italy national football team is tied with the Germany national football team as the second most successful team in the world, having emerged as FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Among the famous sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan, standing as the 7th largest island in the world, comprises nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu).
Due to the collection/group of islands Japan has, it is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago".
In the 15th century, Taiwan was first recorded here by European sailors as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, initiated a transformation in indigenous grain production methods, and employed Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded full sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
There are mainly 3 structures in Machu Picchu, which are Intihuatana, Temple of the Sun, and Room of the Three Windows.
Many buildings on the complex edges have been reconstructed to give tourists an idea of what they were really like.
By 1976, thirty percent of the Matchu pitchulu had been restored, and restoration has continued to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the main motion picture size at the end of the analog film era.
This is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio was inherited from digital camera image sensor formats.
For the 35mm format, it is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm tall.
The aspect ratio of this format is therefore said to be 3:2 (by dividing by twelve to obtain a simple integer ratio).
Many standard formats (such as the APS family of formats) are equal to or close to this factor ratio.
A rule that is often misused and frequently mocked is a simple guideline for creating dynamism when putting order into an image.
The image is divided vertically and horizontally into thirds at the point where the most impactful area's lines intersect (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become elevated and powerful, came under scrutiny.
Despite differences in languages and customs, Christianity bound European countries together for a thousand years.
Its extensive authority affected everyone from the king to the commoner.
To use wealth to eradicate suffering and poverty, and for that reason, there are special funds in the community, is one of the main Christian traditions.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for a thousand years, and this authority has led many to question whether money fulfills this doctrine.
As soon as hostility broke out, Britain began to blockade Germany.
Despite violating commonly accepted international law enshrined by numerous international treaties over the past two centuries, the strategy proved effective by reducing key military and civilian supplies.
English sentence: With Britain discovering international waters to prevent any ships from entering any sections of the sea, neutral vessels also faced danger.
Since there was limited response to this maneuver, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare tactics.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were policies strongly held by many citizens and nations.
During the Second World War, after witnessing the horrors and atrocities, countries wished to ensure that such situations do not arise again in the future.
Tesla went to the United States of America in 1884 to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the US with 4 cents, a poetry book, and a recommendation letter to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of indicating different periods; each phase or family in power in China was a distinct dynasty.
Moreover, the territories of each dynasty were divided for several years. Well known during this period is the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, a fierce battle took place among many rulers fighting for the throne.
In ancient Chinese history, the era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods, with thousands dying fighting for the throne in the Grand Palace in Xi‚Äôan.
There are many social and political influences, such as adopting the metric system, transitioning from dictatorship to a democratic regime, and believing that nationalism and the country belong not only to the ruler but also to the people.
After opening up professions for all male applicants following the revolution, it allows for becoming the most prestigious and successful.
Even from the army, the same applies; the rankings from the army are now dependent on the caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many working-class people who were oppressed in other countries.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He often went to a cave for meditation located on Mount "Noor" (Light), which is called "Hira".
The cave with thousands of years of history clearly reflects the spiritual aspects of Muhammad.
The cave on the mountain located north of Mecca is completely isolated from other parts of the world.
In fact, even if anyone knows it exists, finding it is not that easy. Once you go inside the cave, it is completely solitary.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. From inside the cave, the outside area appears very faint, and sounds are barely heard.
The Great Pyramid in Giza is still one of the seven wonders today.
The Great Pyramid built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE is one of the many large pyramid structures constructed in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), numerous smaller tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "Up Bo" symbol looks like a V, and the "Down Bo" symbol appears as a primary or a square losing its lower side.
This means you have to start at "up" and push the will, and at the bottom you have to start at the cup and pull the will out (this is called holding the will in your hand).
The sound produced when plucking the string upwards is gentle, whereas the sound produced when plucking the string downwards is powerful and more resonant.
Place your own marks in pencil freely, but remember that printed curved signs are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of women from the market forced the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two children (11-year-old Marie-Th√©r√®se and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) to return from Versailles to Paris.
As the crowd gathered around shouting and threatening the king and queen, they traveled back to Paris in a horse carriage.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their chariot windows open.
Once upon a time, a man from the crowd waved the head of a Royal Guard who was killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The war expenses of the U.S government in their victory over the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people.
A major portion of the expenses and the interest on the bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses had to be paid as tax to the U.S. colonial administration.
The excessive profits gained from this long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the primary benefits of the U.S. government.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that inspired the creation of the order.
The period in which events occurred is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000‚Äì1300) in European history.
Before the High Middle Ages, the Early Middle Ages, after the Late Middle Ages, the tradition ends until 1500.
The term technological determinism encompasses many concepts in practice, suggesting the idea that technological advancement or necessity is inspired by a latent logic called human destiny that is inspired by scientific laws and their expression.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: the development of technology follows a path indifferent to cultural or political influence, and technology has impacts on societies that are socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the development of roads is inevitable due to motor cars.
However, a nationwide road network is economically feasible for only a few cars, so new manufacturing methods are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Having too many cars can lead to increased accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to new reforms in the medical field for healing injured bodies in health care.
There is a significant element of romanticism in cultural determinations, drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, people were shaped geographically, but over time those customs and cultures developed geographically, which were later better suited to the social conditions of the time than the unilaterally imposed laws.
Just as France is called the fashion capital in the contemporary world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its name, famous as a center of luxury, began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
The level of warrior heroes declined in the 12th century as they returned gifts containing silk fabrics and spices more valuable than those given by Byzantine markets.
At this time, the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the 10th - 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slow media communication, styles in the West may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
The people of Western Europe began to develop their own style towards the end of the Middle Ages. One of the major developments that occurred as a result of religious wars at that time was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Agriculture is done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is generally often organic, a system that uses stored seeds for crop rotation in the area or other common techniques for higher yield.
Many farmers have historically been engaged in subsistence farming, and it still is in many developing countries.
Subcultures, through social norms, are neglected and bring together individuals with a similar mentality and a sense of a single identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, race, status, place, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a subculture diversely may include a mixture of linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical aspects or factors.
Members of a subculture express their membership through a distinctive and modern style with methods and dialect language that is symbolic.
One of the most common methods used to explain the importance of socialization is to draw unfortunate cases of neglected, unfortunate, or poorly bullied children when they grow up unsocialized.
Children like these are often referred to as "undisciplined" or misbehaving children. Some undisciplined children were abandoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, children were abandoned due to parents rejecting the child for a severe intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have been severely abused or injured before being abandoned or running away.
There are allegations that some were raised by animals; some are believed to have lived on their own in the forest.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child almost fully exhibits the behaviors of the specific caretaker animal, such as fear or indifference towards humans (within physical limits).
While project-based learning needs to be made easier and more interesting, the support provided by the instructor takes it a step further.
Paranja is not a learning method, but it provides a tool to support individuals experiencing new learning experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both imaginative and real, in other words, a teacher can be thought of as a kind of scaffold, like the little paperclip person that appears in Microsoft Office.
Virtual labs are integrated into software and are intended to query, prompt, and describe processes that are challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for many reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even exploitation.
No child needs to be neglected, nurtured, or academically developed, but they do so.
We have realized that the foster care system should be a place of safety for these children.
Our foster care system provides safe homes, loving guardians, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
All the household necessities previously taken should be provided to Foster as toys.
The internet combines aspects of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique features of the internet lead to additional uses and methods of satisfaction.
For example, "practice" and "socialization" have been proposed as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
When researching audience reactions to websites, Igbaria and McCard (1998) also identified new motivational factors such as "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships."
The use of video recording has led to significant breakthroughs in the annotation of micro-expressions and facial movements, which last for just a few milliseconds.
Mainly, whether a person is lying or not can be determined by closely observing their expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, suggested how people with brain damage, who cannot understand speech, are still able to assess sincerity regardless of how sincere they are.
Such abilities to understand human behavior could also be shared by animals like pet dogs, he suggested.
Genetic variation consists of two main parts, as shown by 20th-century research: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic diversity, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
The separation and reuniting of two groups with each generation shifts diversity back and forth.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a mammal with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Moreover, if failed to do so, there will be severe consequences: no growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
Proteins found in leaves and seeds are the most readily available plant resources for us, but for people like us, it is difficult to digest them without cooking.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest but also provides proteins in large quantities that contain the necessary amino acids.
Taking all things into consideration, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same manner as chimps do today on the grassy plains.
Interruption of sleep is the process of deliberately waking up during your regular sleep period and then going back to sleep after a short time (10‚Äì60 minutes).
You can make this easier by using a relatively silent alarm clock that brings consciousness when it is time to fully awaken you.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based choices for a person before sleep include drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, known diuretics), forcing urination.
The inner peace within a person is interconnected with the stress present in one's body and soul.
The lesser the stress, the greater the positive life energy in life. Every person has the ability to find complete peace and satisfaction.
Every individual can attain enlightenment. The only thing obstructing this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Based on the teachings of Buddha, Tibetan Buddhism exists, but it expanded through the Mahayana path of love and many practices from Indian yoga.
Theoretically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes the path of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and universal love.
Through Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the awakening energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Tibet is the center of meditation and divine grace. Through the visualization of various deities, energy pathways are cleansed, chakras are activated, and wisdom consciousness is created.
In the Second World War, Germany became an enemy to everyone, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the countries were led to part ways due to clashes of systems, processes, and cultures.
By the time two years had passed since the war ended, former allies had become enemies and the Cold War began.
This will continue for the next 40 years, with proxy armies, from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, beginning to engage in real battles on the battlefields in many regions.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defense had already collapsed, with the only hope to reorganize being a retreat back along the Romanian bridgehead.
Nevertheless, overnight they implemented the plan, and about 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after attacking the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for the transportation of goods is the most efficient way to move large groups of people and goods across oceans.
The work of navies is that your country has the capability to move its people and goods, while at the same time, interrupting your enemy's capability to move their people and goods.
One of the notable recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans are attempting to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to assist Britain.
During that time, the German navy, primarily using U-boats, is trying to stop this traffic.
With relations failing with allied nations, Germany would likely have taken control of Britain just like the other countries in Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve milk, hair, meat, and skins to make them easily available.
Usually, pet goats were kept in herds located in hills or other grazing areas, often consisting of goats or adolescents, much like a well-known shepherd, frequently being part of a sheep flock. These methods are still used today.
By the 16th century, wagons were built in England.
Even though the carts were made only with wooden planks, they allowed horses to achieve greater speeds and pull larger loads on tougher roads of the day.
Cross ties were introduced very early to hold the rails in place. However, it was gradually realized that tracks would be more effective if there was iron ore on top.
This has become a common practice, but it caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the iron carts.
Finally, iron wheels came in place of wooden wheels. The first full iron rails were introduced in 1767.
He first knows that transportation is walking, humans began walking upright with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man) 2 million years ago.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can also be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not seek only a temporary solution, we must find the root cause of the problems and deactivate them.
It is evident that due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, the world has changed significantly, and problems have further escalated due to the high population and the extreme lifestyle of humankind.
After Congress accepted it on July 4, it was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap, located a few blocks away, after being signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson on a handwritten draft.
"At night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now called 'Dunlap broadsides.'"
On July 8, in the Independence Hall yard, John Nixon publicly read and presented this document related to the Declaration of Independence for the first time.
One person was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it aloud to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
Even now, the 25 Dunlap broad sides in existence are ancient surviving copies of this document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
A group of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are still many things about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet with claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
English sentence: In fact, all computers currently in use rely on the conversion of information coded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number contains only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent to us. It can cause common symptoms like vomiting, so we may not be able to diagnose it immediately.
The best indication of internal toxicity is the presence of an opened medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
For appropriate first aid instructions for that poison, see the label.
Entomologists traditionally use the term "bug" for this group of insects.
This word originated from an ancient relationship with bed bugs, which have become well adapted to parasitizing humans.
Long-legged and blood-sucking insects are both related to completely undeveloped insects, which either live in nests or establish their residence in the body of their host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which is predominantly left as a major neurological disorder among young and middle-aged individuals.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop MS compared to men.
A couple may choose to raise a child for their own well-being or in the interest of their child.
These parents may choose the adoption process for their child.
In adoption, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can act as the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this approach serves as a guide for many scientific investigations.
English sentence: Although this is not done alone, experimentation, as well as experiment, is a test that guides scientific research to eliminate one or more hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations.
Scientists, philosophers, and traditional texts, particularly focused on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinions on all subjects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek knowledge declined, Westerners became separated from their Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms are not merely responses to external periodic cues; they have been recorded in many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that continue their free-running cycling period even without external cues.
Hershey and Chase experiment is one of the famous experiments that revealed DNA as a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, marking the DNA of the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with a radioactive sulfur.
Mutations have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are somatic or germ-line cells.
Only mutations in germ line cells can be passed on to children, mutations in other places may lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are keen to enjoy natural landscapes, which include flora and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting Borneo, taking photos, and learning about orangutans.
Every morning, people drive from their small towns to work, and those who work there meet them.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is connected in some way and supporting the transportation system based on private cars.
Science informs us that this immense carbon economy has removed the climate from one of the stable conditions that have aided human evolution for the past two million years.
Every individual is a part of society and utilizes the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such level of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems have such complaints, and why are they failing on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental happening?
The study of traffic flow examines the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and studies their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because we cannot predict driver behavior with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, the drivers behaved within a reasonable stable range; therefore, it can be said mathematically that the traffic streams have somewhat reasonable stability.
The relationships between three main characteristics have been established to better show traffic flow: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections assist in the planning, design, and operation of road infrastructure facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them evade predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold back their wings along with their body.
This gives them the opportunity to hide in small places extensively to protect themselves from carnivores.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought what he said was correct, but many believed otherwise that the solar system, including the sun (and other stars too), revolves around the Earth.
This seems clever because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon, which flows with a width of 6 miles, is a vast river on Earth.
20 percent of the water that flows from rivers on Earth into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in terms of their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the structures of their predecessors, which were over a thousand years old by then.
Vatican City's population is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the one with the least population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the daily language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican City citizens are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper because they can be found in their natural form in nature and are very easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theoretically proved that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is analogous to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they transform into new materials to form what we see.
Alloys are primarily a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. There are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metal elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is also made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are very small, trillions of them can fit into the periods at the end of this sentence.
In that way, when the pencil came out, it became a good friend to many.
Alas, due to the advent of new writing methods, it has been reduced to a smaller scale and uses.
People are now typing messages on computer screens and never come to the sharpener to sharpen.
When something new comes, anyone might wonder how the keyboard will be.
The fission bomb works on the principle of the energy required to keep many protons and neutrons together in a nucleus.
It is like rolling a heavy rock up a hill. Splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, meaning they decay slowly or not at all.
Stones and dust make up the surface of the moon. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick near the center and 100 km thick away from the center.
It is thin under the maria and thick under the highlands.
The crust being thin can result in more magma nearby. It would be very easy for the lava to rise upwards.
Content principles focus on discovering what helps or appeals to individuals.
These theories suggest that individuals have specific needs and/or desires that are inherent by the time they reach adulthood.
These theories explain how certain individuals are motivated to perform tasks and how specific factors around them influence whether they will or will not perform certain tasks.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's 2-factor theory are two famous content theories.
Typically, when managers start leading their former peers, two behaviors emerge from them. On one hand, they try to be ‚Äúone of the guys‚Äù (or one of the girls).
A manager of this kind has difficulties in making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, analyzing performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes unrecognizable, thinking that they should change everything the team is doing and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is entirely responsible for the team's defeat or victory.
This behavior often leads to rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Except for a few minor differences, virtual teams also possess the same skills as traditional teams.
Virtual team members often serve as a touchpoint for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones that their local executives cannot understand.
A true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also an integral part of a virtual team.
"Invisible Team" is a management team that every member reports to. The Invisible Team sets standards for every member.
Why should an organization move forward with the time-consuming process of establishing a learning institution? The very goal of bringing organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all the resources available in an organization's functional departments are utilized effectively, creativity and creative transformation can be delivered.
As a result, the process of the organization working together to overcome an obstacle leads to a new creative process of providing services to meet the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be creative, leadership must develop a culture of creativity as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
The Telugu sentence translates to: Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method that helps elevate organizational performance to a higher level.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. Therefore, it narrows the research area and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists' research.
It has been known to us for a long time that various types of damage such as brain injuries, mental distress, tumors, etc., influence mental state and lead to changes in their behavior.
New technologies allow us to see and further explore brain structures and processes in ways never seen before.
This provides the information and content necessary to create various simulation models to understand the different processes in our brain.
Even though AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, encompassing behavior, learning, and intelligent imitation in a machine.
In AI, research is involved in creating machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
For example, controlling, planning, organizing, resolving customer queries and issues, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and face.
Such matters have evolved into specific behaviors, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
As AI systems are now built into many home computer and video game software apps, they are frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Very often, a teacher prefers to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology provides a solution with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classroom.
A great way to truly share a field trip is to reflect on it and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their state capital trip, with changes made to the website each year, but the old ones are kept online so that students can review them when necessary.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Students often start their blog experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, however, the presence of an audience usually makes a difference.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
"Similarly, blogging encourages students to become more comfortable with the world around them." The need to feed the audience's interest inspires and engages students (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and it encourages students to learn more than on a traditional school day.
Appropriately using blogs provides students with the autonomy to become more analytical and critical; by actively engaging with internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings and also describe their own perspectives on specific issues (Orevac, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and has a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
In the far south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north, the unparalleled natural beauty of Muskoka, something never seen before.
These all things and more highlight Ontario in a way that outsiders perceive as Canadian.
The large northern regions have very low population, with some almost in uninhabited forests.
To compare a population that many may find surprising: there are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is so far the largest island on its own.

Women: Regardless of their actual marital status, it is good for any female travelers to say that they are married.
Wearing a ring is also useful (not just something that looks expensive).
Women should understand that due to cultural differences, certain actions may be considered harassment, and it is not unusual to experience gestures like following, holding hands, and similar actions.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand firm in your intentions (even if there are cultural differences, it is not right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century by Berber fishermen and used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt this city as Dar al-Baida, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trade posts there.
One of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco is Casablanca.
Around old Medina, places selling traditional Moroccan items like tagines, pottery, leather goods, and hookahs can be easily found, yet it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the eastern side near Rwanda.
In 2002, many streets of the town of Goma, particularly the town center, were destroyed by lava from the Mount Nyiragongo volcano.
Goma is relatively safe, but to understand the situation of ongoing conflicts in North Kivu Province, one should inquire with those who have traveled outside of Goma.
English sentence: This city serves as a base to climb the Nyiragongo volcano as well as to go mountain gorilla tracking, which is quite affordable in parts of Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. A typical (local) fare is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
"""Along with its relative obscurity, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for distant, foreign lands."""
Today, Timbuktu, although a poor town, is made a tourist attraction by its fame, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was also included in the list of World Heritage Sites in danger due to the threat of desert sand.
It is a major site in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
This city is entirely different from the other cities in the country because it predominantly has an Arabic style rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordered to the east by the Mozambique border, to the north by Zimbabwe, and to the south by the Crocodile River.

Sundarbans is the largest littoral mangrove belt in the world, stretching up to 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the Bangladesh and Indian hinterland.
UNESCO declared the Sundarbans as a World Heritage Site. The forest area in the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
These swamps are not just wetlands - they contain remnants of the powerful forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans mangrove forests cover an area of 3,850 km¬≤, with one third of the area covered by water/mud.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans forest has been a sanctuary for wild animals, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart throughout the day from the inter-district bus station (along the river), but most, especially those going towards the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.

The bridge, which aims to complete Brazilian customs checkpoints, is expected to be fully operational by September 2017.
The Guarani, who now live as the most important indigenous group in Eastern Paraguay, also reside as semi-nomadic hunters who engage in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other local indigenous people like the Guaycuru and the Payagua, who make their living through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called "The Giant Province of the Indies," emerged as a result of confronting Spanish colonizers with native Guarani groups.
The Spaniards initiated the colonial period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has largely been able to maintain its indigenous character and identity.

There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: rainfall is fairly consistent throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wild animals should remain wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how fierce they appear, they can attack bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they were not at a safe distance. These animals are large, ferocious, and dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, scents attract bears and other wildlife, so refrain from carrying or cooking fragrant foods, and maintain a clean camp.

Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese dishes are not only seasonal dishes, Javanese flavors include peanuts, spices, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various spices.
Stirrups provide support to the rider's feet that hang on either side of the horse.
These offer more stability to the rider, but they also pose safety concerns as the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse and their foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse may drag them along as it runs. To reduce this risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
First, many riders wear riding boots with heels and soft, very tight, soles.
Afterwards, some jeans, especially English jeans, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to slip back from the jeans as if pulled by a fallen rider.
Cocham√≥ Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, is renowned as the Yosemite of South America, featuring a variety of granite big walls and crags.

Downhill snowsports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding on snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing with many enthusiasts is a major travel activity, sometimes referred to as "ski bums," planning entire vacations around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing has been recognized as a sport since the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was started by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
