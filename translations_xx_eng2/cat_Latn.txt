This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but also offers details that fossils normally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on top with a light or carotenoid-colored background.
The finding also offers insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but they do have other feather characteristics — barbs and barbules — researchers deduce that the rachis was likely an evolutionary development more recent than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying but for regulating temperature or for display. The researchers have suggested that, although it is a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen exhibits the plumage of an adult and not a chick.
Researchers suggest that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen reveals adult feathers, rather than down.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, causing the death of two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.

The luminosity and rotation are used simultaneously to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be regarding magnetic reversals.

The work done has been mostly theoretical, but the program has been written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, which causes the tides, the Milky Way exerts an attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects another dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of halo and is made up of many tiny particles.

In France, elections have traditionally been a not very technological experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed paper sheet with the candidate they have chosen into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting sheet.
The French electoral law strictly codifies the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes at the start of the voting and that no other envelopes are added except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
The candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the procedure. In the evening, the volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

The first was the slalom, in which she received a "Did Not Finish" in the first run. Thirty-six of the remaining 116 competitors ended with the same result.
The other race she participated in, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting group, with a combined time of all runs of 4:41.30; 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first to finish, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth place finisher, Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers from the seated group did not finish their races, and 45 out of a total of 117 giant slalom skiers failed to qualify in the race.
The laptop and the mobile phone that had been stolen were recovered thanks to the work of the Madhya Pradesh police.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have detained five people who assaulted the Swiss woman and have recovered her mobile and her computer."
The accused are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The superintendent of police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Despite there being three people inside the house when the car impact occurred, no one was injured.
Despite this, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
First, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was relocated to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at the Scottish Sheriff Court charged with the murder of her son.
He is in custody pending charge and trial, but any eyewitness could be rejected because his image has been published everywhere.
This is common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice operates differently, and the courts have viewed the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee points out that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc., of suspects."
The Crown office, responsible for the prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that it will make no further statements, at least until the verdict.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to establish according to the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East war.
Among the other issues discussed, reportedly, there is the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the dispute over the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands an uninterrupted military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA only commits to accepting it for five years.
The hunters in the supplementary pest control pilot program had to be closely supervised by the forest rangers, while the pilot program was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In an association of NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Interim Director of Conservation and Heritage Park with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received appropriate safety training and instruction.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council, as part of a package of measures aimed at moving the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in the month of October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the lack of holding elections, some of which were scheduled for 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of malfunction and overheating of iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and resulting in minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that it had been informed of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported 34 other incidents related to overheating, which the company described as "not serious."
In response, the ministry described Apple's postponement of the report as "frankly unfortunate."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The office of emergency management in the Northern Marianas has said that no damages have been reported in the nation.
Similarly, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center indicated that there had been no tsunami warning.
A former Filipino policeman has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued, and so far, the death of at least six has been confirmed.
Recently, six hostages have been released, including the children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth during his free time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, the baby's fetal lung maturation would be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders 'black boxes' on Wednesday.
Fellow fighters have also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as freaky as I was... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her greatly... I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The winner of the gold medal at the Olympic Games was supposed to swim in the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been in doubt due to his complaints.
He could not take the necessary medications to endure his pain because they are banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number discovered as of January 25.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water sent to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, particularly how Earth was formed, since some comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his government at the beginning of this year and signed a law last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He labeled the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
It is speculated that they will run in the 2016 presidential elections.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
He uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the old land-based radar technology so that traffic controllers can locate pilots with much more precision and send them more accurate information.
The reinforcement of public transport is not being considered, and surface trains will not stop at Wembley; there are also no car parking spaces or park-and-ride facilities at street level.
The concern about a lack of transport has raised the possibility that the game might have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science described the formation of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species has evolved in just two generations, despite it being thought that much more time was needed for this process, due to the crossing between a Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis (endemic), and a conical-billed Galápagos finch, Geospiza conirostris (foreign).
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be molded into the smallest figures.
It can be inserted into thin threads, which can be twisted. It can be beaten or flattened into sheets.
It can be made very thin and stacked on other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images of books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Red cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) a substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the substance analyzed.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then, with clean, damp hands, form a ball.
The moisture from the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a kind of barrier.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated wastewater system.
Remains of sewer systems have been discovered in houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women gathered together.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and our view.
A giant rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The most notable thing the wheel has done for us is to make transport much faster and simpler.
The train, the car, and many other means of transport have brought us.
Below them, there are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felids (including feral domestic cats) that eat the smaller prey which are by far more abundant, such as small insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of its success is the niche concept, a special job that each cat has and that prevents competing with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three related adult males together with up to thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave largely like packs or wolf packs, which are animals with a surprisingly similar behavior to lions (although not to other big cats) and equally deadly to their prey.
The tiger, a complete athlete, can climb (although not very well), swim, jump great distances, and push with 5 times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of the lion, but rather similar to a shouted phrase of angry words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find the animals they eat (prey) by smell, sniffing the trails they leave on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they can also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging with the environment and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main and original group (for example, by crossing a mountain range or a river, or migrating to a new island and being unable to return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they had before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it needed before to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
With time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it starts to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations were so different that they could no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, that we expire).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and make clothes with plants. Most of what we eat are plants. Without plants, most animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, which is why it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than seventy knife-sharp teeth, accompanied by an additional set on the roof of the mouth, so there was no escape for anything that got in its way.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, long fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex could rival him.
Even though most of their foods would be familiar to us, the Romans had a few rare or unusual products at their banquets; such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and rodents called dormice.
Another difference was that, while the poor people and women ate sitting on a chair, wealthy men liked to participate in banquets where they reclined together while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For instance, they did not have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a primary temple that was considered the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the gods' needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an enclosed sanctuary that only the priests could access.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, housing was not so important.
Most of the life of a Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the stores were simple open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland because of a murder and, while traveling west, discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
However, despite its discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences between the peoples, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might imagine that there is a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text is located at the bottom of the document, facing down.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its creation, the long parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Thus, it seems that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by Vichy France. These were French people who had signed peace with the Germans in 1940 and who collaborated with the invaders instead of confronting them.
The allies invaded the south of France on August 15, 1940, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were advancing towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this also somehow defines the dimensions of society.
City-states preceded nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across many generations, a persistent cultural footprint, and equitable diffusion.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving obvious historical traces and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — with Congress being its only component — under the Articles of the Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and, as there was no national executive or judicial authority, it fell to the state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
Nor did he have the authority to invalidate tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous approval of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italy national football team, alongside the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and they were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
The most well-known sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, rink hockey, and F1 auto racing.
The most popular sports in the northern regions are winter sports, and they include the presence of Italians who participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making it the 7th largest island country in the world.
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, we often call it, in geographical terms, an "archipelago."
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors coined the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island, for the island.
In the year 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southeast of Taiwan, where it began transforming indigenous grain production practices and resorted to Chinese workers for the rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas of the west and north of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in the year 1885.
In the year 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which would govern the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
In the year 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common frame format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but even more importantly: its aspect ratio has been inherited in the formats of digital image camera sensors.
The 35 mm format actually creates some confusion, with a width of 36 mm and a height of 24 mm.
It is said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers) is, therefore, 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are the same or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been overused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
He says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see the example).
During this period, European history questioned the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united European states despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds exist precisely for this reason.
The principal authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many people to question whether this dogma was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, cutting off vital supplies to both military and civilians, although this blockade violated generally accepted international laws that had been codified by various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined the international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Since there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wished to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his last job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different historical periods: each stage of China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most well-known of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which took place over 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these periods, fierce wars took place among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras of ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Likewise, after the Revolution, occupations were opened to all men who applied, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve it.
This also applies to the military, because instead of basing the army's ranks on classes, from this moment they were based on relevance.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed became deeply interested in matters that go beyond this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that would be known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, provides a rather clear image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
At the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even knowing of its existence, it is not easy to find at all. The isolation is absolute once you enter the cave.
Nothing can be seen except a serene and beautiful sky overhead, and the abundant mountains surrounding it. There is very little of this world that can be seen or felt from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing.
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramidal structures constructed to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, various temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected in honor of the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The "upward arc" signal resembles the letter V (lowercase v) and the "downward arc" looks like a staple or a square without the bottom side.
When it appears upwards, it means you have to start from the tip and push the bow upward, and when it is downwards, it means you have to start from the heel (where the hand holds the bow) and draw the bow downward.
Rubbing the strings from right to left generates a softer sound, while doing it the other way around produces a louder and more assertive sound.
Feel free to write down your own instructions, but keep in mind that the slur markings are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, four years old), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a crowd of market women to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the King and the Queen.
The crowd forced the king and the queen to keep the carriage windows fully open.
At a certain point, a member of the crowd displayed the head of a murdered royal guard at Versailles before the horrified Queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime in order to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Of course, the substantial profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that promoted the creation of the order.
The era in which the events took place is popularly known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 - 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is guided by a hidden logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
The majority of interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, at the same time, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that motor vehicles necessarily lead to the development of roads.
Nevertheless, a nationwide road network for a handful of cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new medical assistance techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had an important component of cultural determinism, outlined by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, which were better than arbitrarily imposed laws, as they were in harmony with the place and with society.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital in the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its renown for being an epicenter of luxury began around the year 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
His status declined during the twelfth century mainly because the crusaders had returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices that were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at that moment that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak popularity in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, and in the 14th century.
Initially, the clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of communication channels, styles could reach the west with a delay of 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of the era is that, as a result of the Crusades, people started to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is the one that is carried out to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses native saved seeds of the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most peasants were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel abandoned by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of the factors.
Members of a subculture often distinguish themselves from those of other subcultures by the distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which includes fashions, customs, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to refer to the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults while growing up, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse.
These children are called "wild" or feral. Some wild children have been isolated by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this child abandonment was due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
The wild children may have suffered child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others have supposedly been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
The wild child, when raised only by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (always within physical limits) almost entirely identical to those of the animal that raises it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Even though project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
The theory of scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals undergoing a new training experience, such as learning to use a new computer program or starting a project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or real: in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the small Microsoft Office assistant clip.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized in the software and are designed to question, display, and explain procedures that might have been too complicated for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, including exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not fed, loved, and educated, but some do.
We believe that the foster care system is a form of security for these children.
Our reception system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The reception is supposed to provide all the needs that were not met in the house from where they were originally taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important reasons for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated the audience's reaction to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The King's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that these abilities to interpret human behavior could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and exposed.
The mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of variation that is expressed.
Segregation and recombination combine variation back and forth between the two genetic heritages in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
Moreover, not achieving it has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant resources to obtain would have been the proteins provided by leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, these are difficult for primates like us humans to digest.
On the other hand, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested, but they also provide a large amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
However, we should not be surprised by the fact that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
The interruption of sleep is the process of deliberately waking up during the normal sleep period and falling back asleep after a while (10 - 60 minutes).
This is easy to do using a quiet alarm clock that makes you aware but does not wake you up completely.
If you are someone who resets the clock while sleeping, try placing it on the other side of the room, so that you have to get up to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to sleep, so that one is forced to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated to the amount of tension in one's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force present is. Every person has the potential to find full peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it spread through the path of Mahayana's love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which facilitated collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the armistice came the clash of systems, processes, and cultures, and both countries became adversaries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next forty years and was fought in earnest, with proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had already been breached and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, or multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient method of moving large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most relevant recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
Contemporaneously, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany could have conquered Great Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them to easily obtain milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pastures, often watched over by shepherds who were usually children or teenagers. These grazing methods are still used today.
The carriages were built in England around the 16th century.
Even though the tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they pulled the wagons with horses to achieve higher speeds and pull larger loads in the more difficult parts.
The sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was soon seen that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron cover on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron wore down the wooden wheels of the wagons more.
In the end, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first fully iron rails were introduced in the year 1767.
The first known means of transport was walking, humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in australopithecine fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although sahelanthropes could have walked on two legs as far back as 7 million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to partially reduce the suffering that might exist in the future.
This works only as a symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and that problems have increased because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thompson, was sent to John Dunlap's press located a few streets away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are known today as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he had read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of this document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe today that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. We call them birds.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many traits of birds that resemble those of a dinosaur.
They have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a tyrannosaurus would.
Practically all the computers we use today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two possible values, namely, 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits or bits, according to computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are quite general, so an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Look for instructions on specific first aid for the specific poison on the label.
The term insect is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient kinship with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both reduviids and bedbugs are nidicolous, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research has concluded that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple can decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main objective of science is to figure out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only thing, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses; the formulation of questions and observations also guide scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinions on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of the Greeks diminished, the East found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented in most living beings, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that follow an inertia period even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments marking the DNA of the virus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the virus with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, whereas mutations anywhere else can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of in-situ activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
An example is to visit, photograph, and learn about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out from the small rural villages to go to their workplaces and pass by others whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic vehicle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows us today that this colossal carbon economy has disrupted one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear so many complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transportation systems generate this kind of complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that are established between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a considerably consistent range; therefore, the traffic flow tends to be fairly constant and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between its three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operations of road facilities.
The insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings around their body.
This provides them with a great variety of tiny places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the dragonfly and the mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun.
There were people who thought that what he was saying was true, but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System was moving towards the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because we do not feel that the Earth is moving, or do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles in width.
20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though pyramid construction with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical excellence of the construction of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were fascinated by the monuments of their predecessors, which then were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the daily language used by most of the people living in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
It is known that basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known since ancient times, as all of them can be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although in addition, according to his theory, they changed to become new substances that form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also other metals like silver and gold.
One can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
The entire Universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of atoms would fit inside the full stop at the end of this sentence.
In this way, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a minor status and uses.
Nowadays people write messages on computer screens, never needing a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer emerges.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to bind a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the nucleus again releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no collision.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust measures 70 km thick in the nearest part and 100 km in the farthest part.
It is thinner beneath the lunar seas and thicker beneath the mountainous areas.
There might be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface.
Theories of content focus on finding what people like or are interested in.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they do and which aspects of their environment will cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to continue as "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable for their actions.
In the opposite case, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team has been doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often ends in clashes between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Members of a virtual group usually serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They tend to have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as their teams can meet according to different time zones that local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the administrative team to which each of the members is addressed. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? One of the objectives of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can emerge when all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization.
As a result, the joint work of an organization to overcome adversity can lead to an innovative process to meet the client's needs.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provided physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research. Therefore, it reduces the research area and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior supports the scientists' research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of damage, trauma, injuries, and brain tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, it forms a very important branch of computer science that studies intelligent machine behavior, learning, and adaptation.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been built into various home computer applications and video games.
Thematic outings are an important part of any class. Very often, a teacher would love to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or contemplate the beauty of art while seated with their class.
Sharing a virtual journey is also an excellent way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future students.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital; every year the site is updated, but the old versions remain online as a memory book.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, this usually changes with the presence of an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts making an effort to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
Moreover, blogs "force students to be more astute with the world around them." The need to feed the audience's interest inspires students to be clever and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can help students to be more analytical and critical; they can define their stances in the context of what others write and also highlight their own perspectives on specific topics by actively responding to internet materials (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and features a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Towards the south are the Niagara Falls, and the north hosts the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
These are all the elements, among others, that make Ontario stand out in the eyes of outsiders as the quintessential Canadian city.
The population of the large northern expanses is rather sparse, and some areas are almost uninhabited wilderness.
To make a comparison of populations that tends to be surprising: there are more African Americans living in the USA than Canadian citizens.
The islands of Eastern Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in itself in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach tourist centers.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it took a great path in Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel, and in the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler says she is married, regardless of her true marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (one that doesn't look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Reject men firmly, and do not be afraid to defend your position (with or without cultural differences, it is not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Amazigh fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids used it as a strategic port, which was called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya; the name Casablanca comes from the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, we can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of souvenirs, but it is all designed for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, towards the eastern end, near Rwanda.
In the year 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly those in the center.
While Goma is considerably safe, it would be advisable to investigate before making any visit outside this city to assess the state of the ongoing conflicts in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the most economical mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' special program "Wonders of the African World" for PBS.
The city is in stark contrast with the rest of the cities in the country because it has a more Arabic atmosphere rather than African.
The Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, and Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River marks the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting diverse wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the benchmark of South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, a daily conservation and entry fee must be paid.
Purchasing a Wild Card can also be beneficial, as it allows entry to either a selection of parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider the main center.
The set of buildings that make up the urban skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a brilliant bar chart that becomes evident with the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go across to the other side of the Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely populated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers occupied, therefore, it is a good spot to start if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland across Bangladesh and India from the coast.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps — they also include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which around one third is covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axis deer in the area.
The buses leave from the intercity bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Panakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long, and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical open space under the bridge is 15 meters. Although the construction was completed in August 2011, it was not possible to cross it until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited what is today eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies," was created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important annual tournament for this sport takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Tournaments and smaller matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about the tournaments or where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), with a set value equivalent to that of a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West store.
Generally, British pounds are accepted throughout the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and United States dollars are also accepted.
On the peripheral islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although they may accept British and U.S. currency; check with the owners in advance to determine which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so it must be done before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone. In the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is more or less consistent throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, they remain wildlife and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not having kept a sufficient distance. These animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Additionally, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is situated on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a famous insubordination in the year 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave it.
All the ships were sunk except for a British cruiser. Additionally, nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the fight for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the death of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
The beaches are abundant, as Auckland is situated between two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of them are sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most have shade thanks to the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes family beaches filled with a good range of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The most well-known local beer is "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
Many French wines can be taken there, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia do not tolerate travel well.
It is completely safe to drink local tap water, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of "tallat" is foreign. A "short coffee" is an espresso, the cappuccino comes loaded with cream (without foam), and tea is served without milk.
The melted chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but the quality is excellent.
Throughout the year, many trips are made to the reef and injuries due to any of these causes are rare.
Even so, follow the recommendations of the authorities, respect all the signs, and pay close attention to the safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. Occasionally, they can also be found outside of these months.
Sharks exist, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and keep their distance.
Saltwater crocodiles do not lead an active life in the ocean; their main habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of knowing they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transport to/from the airport, or even combined packages with flights and hotel.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to present other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any request or suggestion should be sent first to the travel agency and not to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of attendees choose to camp right there, and most of them consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to arrive early to secure a spot to camp near the music.
It should be remembered that even though the music may have ended on the main stages, there can be sections of the festival that continue playing well into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, because crossing the ice generates a terrible noise in the most affected ones.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Passenger cruises are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos often strive to maximize the time and money their visitors spend there. There are usually no windows or clocks, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offers to cheer up the guests and keep them from leaving the establishment.
Some venues offer alcoholic drinks inside the house. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know that it is important to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or through mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or very low temperatures.
Friction is low on icy and snowy roads, and you cannot drive on them as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall to trap you in a very short time.
Visibility can also be reduced by falling snow or snow displaced by the wind, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues without many interruptions throughout the year.
Probably, safaris are the main tourist attraction in Africa and the most relevant for many tourists.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to an overland journey to see the spectacular African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants or giraffes, tend to approach the cars, and the standard equipment will allow for good views.
Animals like lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and that's why you can see them better by using binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") involves hiking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo will be the first Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked the flights and accommodation for the year 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a delicate situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March, most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were supposed to be held.
It is expected that most of the tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with a typical ticket costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help dry them. In many hotels, you can request an iron and an ironing board, even if there isn't one in the room.
If there is no iron available or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to overheat (it could shrink or, in extreme cases, scorch).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against certain dangers.
In some areas, boiling the water for one minute is sufficient; in others, a few minutes are needed.
The effectiveness varies from filter to filter, and in case of concerns, you should consider buying water from a known brand in sealed bottles.
Travelers may encounter animal pests with which they are not familiar in their regions of origin.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or animals capable of injuring or killing people by force, are usually not considered pests.
Duty free purchases are an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and duties in certain places.
Travelers from countries with high taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which frequently passes through isolated wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: there are steep slopes, narrow stretches, and sharp bends.
The indicated speed limits are notably lower than those of other previous and subsequent sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to the limits is even more important than it would be otherwise.
Even though it is curious, the mobile phone service is stronger here than in many other segments of the route, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German pastry is quite good and the one from Bavaria is plentiful and very diverse, similar to that of Austria, its southern neighbors.
Pastries with fruit are common, with baked apples inside the pastries year-round and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many baked German products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The most well-known cakes often pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small pastries but full of flavor, try what is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a generic term to cover a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without any other qualifier, the term usually refers to the food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Nowadays, Javanese cuisine is easy to find throughout the archipelago and offers a great variety of simply seasoned dishes. The favorite flavors of the Javanese are usually those of peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang from each side of the saddle.
They are more stable for the rider, but they may present safety issues because the rider's feet could get caught in them.
If a rider falls from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
To begin with, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a quite thin sole.
Moreover, some saddles, particularly English ones, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to drop from the saddle if a rider pulls it backwards when falling.
The Cochamó Valley: Chile's most prominent climbing destination, also known as the Yosemite of South America, features many large granite walls and cliffs.
There are some breathtaking views from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world continuously establish new routes among its endless expanse of walls.
Alpine sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered slopes with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, often known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
The concept of skiing is very ancient — there are cave paintings depicting skiers from before 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, but it was in 1861 that some Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also called ski touring, ski tourism, or ski hiking.
He is related to it, but generally does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter carried out on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine a ski route as something similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than walking - although on few occasions will you achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on flattened tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling between various countries would involve having to apply for many visas and undergo passport controls.
The Schengen Area, however, functions as a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
In the same way, having a Schengen visa does not require applying for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for manufactured items that are considered antiques. Some tax agencies determine that goods over 100 years old are antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, where the age limit can be lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handcrafted products can be categorized as antiques, even though they are more recent than other similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important means of subsistence among the Sami, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many with other occupations.
Even in tradition, however, not all Sami people have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding; instead, they lived by fishing, hunting, and similar activities, with reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami territory.
Even though it is widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is usually considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel alert, your travel or cancellation insurance may be affected.
Perhaps you might be interested in hearing the recommendations of governments different from yours, but their recommendations are intended for their own citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East could find themselves exposed to different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is simply a brief summary of the political situation of a country.
The considerations presented tend to be brief, general, and too simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather condition is the general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, significant social disruptions, or loss of human lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur all around the world, and there are different types that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and uncontrolled fires are forms and effects of adverse weather phenomena, such as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Among the severe regional and seasonal weather phenomena are blizzards, snowstorms, and sandstorms.
It is strongly recommended that travelers stay aware of any adverse weather risks affecting their area as it could alter their travel plans.
Anyone intending to visit a country that might be considered a war zone should take a professional training course.
An internet search for "Hostile Environment Course" will probably provide the address of a local business.
A course will usually cover all the issues discussed here in better detail, typically with practical experience.
A course will usually last from 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing games, lots of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in nature are common, but there are few publications that deal with war zones.
Travelers who plan to undergo sex change surgery in another country must ensure they carry the valid documents for the return journey.
The availability of governments to issue passports where the sex is not specified (X) or updated documents to show the desired name or sex is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents can vary widely.
The records at security checkpoints have also become far more invasive in the post-September 11 era.
Preoperative transsexuals should not have to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the flow that returns after the waves crash against the beach, often to a reef or similar.
Due to the topology of the water, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper stations, and a strong current towards deep waters can form there.
The majority of deaths occur as a result of fatigue when attempting to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head somewhere you won't be captured again or, depending on your abilities or if you've been informed, you might want to wait for a rescue.
The shock of return arrives before the culture shock (with a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
For travelers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture, it is often particularly difficult to readapt to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your native culture.
When you went abroad, at first people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Sometimes one does not foresee that patience and understanding are also necessary when travelers return home.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show begins.
Usually, the sounds of tourists and vendors are heard. The story of sound and light is truly a tale.
The Sphinx serves as a backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes of the story are displayed on the pyramids, which are illuminated at the same time.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are disputed among many nations and have most of the bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others, there are the islands of Livingston and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the Peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge and form a plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a maximum of 4,892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations and without phone coverage, satellite telephony may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to make a call.
The service is typically used on vessels, including recreational boats, as well as on expeditions that require remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
One increasingly popular option among people considering a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among students who have not completed their studies, giving them the opportunity to take a year off before starting university without compromising their education.
Enrolling in a gap year course abroad can often improve the chances of starting higher education again in your country.
Typically, there will be enrollment fees to sign up for these educational programs.
Finland is an important sailing destination. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht in archipelagos and lakes.
Even though any yacht can pass through the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sport sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every 7 or 8 people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand equate to this, but it is equally quite special (for example, in the Netherlands, the figure is one in forty).
The majority of the various Baltic cruises make an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historical center of the city by spending a couple of whole days, returning to sleep on the ship at night.
If you only disembark with on-board excursions, you don't need an independent visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany, in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not at all near the sea and the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they haven't flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It is not a cause for shame: there is no difference with the fears and personal apprehensions that many people express towards other things.
For some, having knowledge about how a plane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on not having control.
Courier companies charge well for delivering things quickly. Often, time is very important for business documents, merchandise, or replacement parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem with other routes and smaller companies.
If they sent the things by plane, there are routes where unloading and customs clearance can take days.
The only way to send it faster was to do it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to send luggage without a passenger carrying it, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to pay a good wad of money for this privilege (or, even better, get your company to do it for you).
However, this is certainly not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the economy fare for business class, and up to eleven times for first class!
In general, it doesn't make sense to look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay more for the privilege of arriving at a place quickly and comfortably, and accordingly pay.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The native language is Romanian, but Russian is commonly used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria, in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, although it is not recognized by any United Nations member country.
The economic links have been reestablished between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The site of the former city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, situated around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide promenades, the buildings with glass facades, and the modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tile roofs, the 18th-century market, and the ancient mosques and churches, although the city exudes more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldarsvík, you can enjoy views of the neighboring island of Eysturoy. There is also a very unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are some interesting sculptures of doves made of marble on some graves.
It's worth walking for half an hour to an hour and a half through the interesting town.
To the north and easily accessible lies the romantic and fascinating village of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after a brilliant account of its splendors recorded by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb bus 403 goes to Sintra regularly, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima, a place of Marian apparitions known worldwide.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave and a place with almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death here, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not damage the place by painting or carving graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Nearly half prefer to speak in Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan because it is, by law, the priority official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular messages in the subway are only made in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are announced with an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are reputed to be egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is usually just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave as well as you can, to act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will allow you to move around much more easily.
The brusque appearance of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show a minimum of courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is very forested, with beeches, spruces, and firs, and hosts a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It enjoys a remarkable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soils, and diverse altitudes.
The area is also home to a vast variety of animal and bird species.
One can find peculiar wildlife such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the capercaillie, along with many more common species.
During visits to the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer covers to women who are not prepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
In the same way, men must also wear trousers that cover their knees.
This piece can also be requested at the entrance, but it's clothing that isn't washed after each use, so you might find it uncomfortable to wear these skirts. The size is one-size-fits-all!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of other similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available topping such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie for you, always begin with a capital letter, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.
This is a good way to distinguish some verbs from objects.
It can be stated that it facilitates reading, although writing is a bit complicated because one must determine if a verb or adjective is being used as a noun.
Pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the vowels that follow them.
Additionally, make sure to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means cart.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading these basic concepts about grammar will greatly help you learn Persian grammar and better understand its sentences.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who can speak a little Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is so similar that it does not need to be studied separately.
Premodern observatories are mostly obsolete nowadays and remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution at the time was not a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those built today.
The majority of modern research telescopes are large facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, an activity known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where the cherry blossom was the most appreciated.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were organized by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to take "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally arranged garden and collect any "samples," you will also be expelled without hesitation.
Generally, Singapore is an extremely safe place and very easy to navigate, and you can buy practically anything after arriving.
However, being located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also some buses that travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Interior waterways can be a good theme on which to base a vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to the interesting cities of the Danube or sailing through the Erie Canal.
They also establish routes for well-known hiking and cycling circuits.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Non-believers from both Christian and non-Christian countries around the world have also embraced many of the traditions surrounding the festival.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night keeping watch somewhere in the open air to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is very plausible that it is a spring and fertility ritual prior to Christianity.
The most traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, and congregations usually start the celebrations at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the island did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
The great distance from the continent prevented mammals from traveling there, which led to the giant tortoise becoming the first grazing animal of the Galápagos.
Since the arrival of humans to the Galápagos, many mammals have been introduced, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky will remain dark practically all day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is usually not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are accustomed to seeing.
Suits are the standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Peace in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing the group effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often need the approval of their superiors for any decision they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without questioning them.
