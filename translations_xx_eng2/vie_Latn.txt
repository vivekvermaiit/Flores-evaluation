This not only confirms a hypothesis that many people are already aware of, that at least some dinosaur species had feathers, but also provides detailed information that fossils cannot reveal, such as color or 3D structure.
Scientists believe that the fur of this species is chestnut brown on the top and grayish-blue or yellow/orange underneath.
This discovery also provides an insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
"Because the feathers of dinosaurs did not have well-developed feather shafts called rachis but had other characteristics of feathers - down and filaments - researchers believe that the rachis might be a later evolutionary development with these other features."
The structure of the feathers suggests that this plumage was not used for flying but for controlling body temperature or for display. Researchers believe that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen exhibits mature feathers, not downy fluff.
Researchers believe that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult bird feathers and not chicken feathers.

The completed work is mainly theoretical, but the program is written to simulate the observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team is looking for will be created by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Similar to how the moon exerts gravitational force on the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way also exerts force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter similarly to the properties of ordinary matter.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter around a galaxy lies around a galaxy in a halo and is composed of many small particles.

Candidates can send representatives to witness the entire process. In the evening, the ballots will be counted by volunteers under strict supervision, according to a special procedure.

Her other race, in the Giant Slalom skiing event, saw her finish 10th in the women's rankings with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Australian first-place finisher Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers on the women's team did not finish the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom event did not secure a position in the rankings.
Madhya Pradesh Police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested the five men who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her phone and laptop."
The accused suspects are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver survived despite suffering a severe head injury.
The road where the collision occurred is temporarily closed while emergency services have freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
At first, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
After that, Adekoya was convicted in Edinburgh Sheriff Court of killing her son.
She is currently detained pending indictment and trial, but all evidence from witnesses may be dismissed because her image has been widely disseminated.
This practice is very common in England, but Scotland is different; the law and courts here have deemed that distributing images can be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee noted that "perhaps journalists are indeed treading on a dangerous path when publicly sharing images, etc., of suspects."
The Prosecution Office, in charge of overall prosecution affairs, informed reporters that there would be no comments at least until the prosecution.
The dossier, according to the leak, will refer to border conflicts, which Palestine wants based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly included the future status of the sacred Jerusalem for both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requests to maintain military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to a five-year presence.
The hunters in the supplementary pest control pilot program were closely monitored by rangers because the pilot program was supervised and evaluated for effectiveness.
Under the cooperation agreement between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, eligible volunteers have been recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's personnel search program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of NPWS Parks and Wildlife Conservation Agency, the four shooters selected for the first shot received comprehensive training and guidance on safety principles.
Martelly was sworn in to the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council established by Martelly in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission requested the interim Electoral Council (CEP) to resign. This request is part of a package of measures aimed at transitioning to a new election period for the country.
This order is Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests since October.
These sometimes violent protests stem from failed elections, some of which should have taken place since 2011.
According to reports, there have been about 60 cases of handheld iPod music devices overheating, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that they have been informed of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported to them an additional 34 overheating incidents which the company deemed "not serious."
In response to the announcement, the ministry called the delay in Apple's report an “extremely regrettable incident.”
The earthquake occurred in Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 GMT, on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there are no signs of a tsunami occurring.
A former Philippine police officer took some tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking the bus carrying them in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many hostages have been rescued, and so far, at least six people have been confirmed dead.
Like the Filipino photographers, six hostages including children and the elderly were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of the elderly woman when she needed the bathroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
He received specialized training in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland from 1959.
During his time working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm birth during his free time.
His research shows that if a hormone is injected, the growth rate of the fetal lungs will be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered the two 'black boxes' of the plane on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also expressed their gratitude to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the First Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. Unique like herself. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna is just as scary as I am... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... hope she is in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard in the 2010 federal election program said she believes that Australia should become a republic when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
34 percent of those polled shared this view, they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the survey, 29% of participants believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist is expected to participate in the 100m and 200m freestyle swimming events and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but according to his complaint, his physical condition is not up to par.
He cannot use medication for pain relief because those drugs have been banned from use in the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper is a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, who discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Some individuals verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have once been a source of water for the Earth along with organic matter capable of forming types of proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, particularly how Earth was formed, because comets have collided with Earth since ancient times.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began serving as governor earlier this year. Last month, he signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called these rumors "political gossip and madness."
There were once rumors that he would run for president in 2016.
NextGen is the system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to ground-based radar technology, allowing air traffic controllers to locate airplanes with greater accuracy and providing pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport means will be deployed, and ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there will be no parking and park-and-ride facilities in the area.
Concerns about a lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the match will have to be played behind closed doors without the fans of this team.
A study was published in the journal Science on Thursday about the formation of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
According to the report by researchers from Princeton University, USA, and Uppsala University, Sweden, new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is believed to take longer, due to the combination between Darwin’s finches, the Geospiza species and the migratory bird Geospiza.
Gold can be crafted into all shapes. It can be made into objects of very small sizes.
It can be drawn into thin fibers to twist and braid. It can be beaten or rolled into sheets.
It can be beaten very thin and plated onto other metals. It can be beaten so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH level of the chemical. You can create an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color according to the acidity or alkalinity (base) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the laboratory chemical.
Hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost an electron (as a hydrogen atom consists of a proton and an electron).
Twist two dry dough pieces together, then squeeze them into a ball with wet, clean hands.
The moisture on your hand will react with the outer layers to create a strange feeling and form a type of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a complex drainage system.
The ruins of wastewater systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where both men and women used them together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then bounces it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and images of our observations.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing that the wheel has brought to life is helping us to travel and transport much more easily and quickly.
It brings us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
At a lower level, there are medium-sized species of the cat family, preying on medium-sized animals ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cat species (including house cats) eat large numbers of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special job that each cat has to avoid competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social type of cat, living in large groups called prides.
The herd consists of one to three related adult males along with about thirty females and their offspring.
Women often have close relationships with each other in a family with many sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very dangerous to prey.
Like an all-around athlete, a tiger can climb (although not very well), swim, jump far, and pull with five times the pulling force of a strong person.
Tiger is in the same group (Panthera) with lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four big cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the thunderous roar of a lion, but rather akin to a series of growls in its throat.
Ocelots eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if possible. Most of the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that South American wildcats track and find animals to prey on by smell, sniffing each spot where the prey has stood.
They can see very clearly in the dark with night vision and move skillfully, unbeknownst to anyone. Wild cats hunt their prey by camouflaging into their surroundings, then pounce on the prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small number) separates from the main population (such as when they move across a mountain range or a river, or to an island far from their starting point making it difficult for them to return), this group of creatures will often perceive that they are in a different environment compared to before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptive abilities to become a stronger competitor than they previously were.
The initial population does not change at all, they still need adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new group of residents began to adapt to their new environment, they started to look increasingly less like other resident groups.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look different to the point that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the creation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable and extremely important consequence of evolution.
Trees produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is breathing out).
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of our food comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Tyrannosaurus was the apex predator during its time, so it feared nothing, except other Tyrannosauruses.
Its long jaw is equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth along with additional teeth on the palate, which means nothing can escape its path.
We are not sure, but it might have a forked tongue. Its diet includes turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might even be a predator.
It also attacked everything on land; even giant dinosaurs like T. rex were no match for it.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans shared strange or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women sit on chairs to eat, the rich prefer to host parties together and recline leisurely to eat.
The meals of ancient Rome did not feature foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not eat corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each god and regarded it as the home of that god.
People will bring offerings to present to the deities, and the priests will try to meet the needs of the deities through rituals and festivals.
Each temple has an outer courtyard area and inside is a church that only priests have the right to enter.
Sometimes, towers with a special pyramid shape, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The pinnacle of the tower is a special sanctuary dedicated to the deity.
With the warm climate of the Middle East, housing is not too important.
The Hebrew family spent most of their time living outdoors.
Women are cooking in the yard; the newly opened shops face the street. Stone is used to build houses.
There are no large forests in the region of Canaan, so wood is very expensive here.
Greenland is sparsely populated. Norse mythology tells that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder and while heading west he discovered Greenland and named the land Greenland.
However, regardless of his discoveries, the Eskimo tribes lived there at that time.
Although they are all 'Scandinavian' countries, there are still many differences in people, royal families, customs, and history among Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have watched the movie National Treasure you might think the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not correct. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, there is the line "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." This line appears at the very bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one is sure about the author of the document, it is known that in the early days, this document written on a large sheepskin (29¾ inches long and 24½ inches wide) was rolled up for preservation.
So, annotations can possibly be added simply as tags.
The Allied forces' landing and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
This area was ruled by the "Vichy" French Government. These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched "Operation Dragoon," invading southern France.
In just two weeks, the United States military and the Free French forces liberated southern France and then turned towards Germany.
A civilization is an outstanding culture shared by a large group of people living and working collectively as a society.
The word civilization originates from "civilis" in Latin, meaning "pertaining to the people," related to "civis" in Latin, meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," and it also somewhat defines the scale of society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. The culture of civilization contains the transmission of knowledge across generations, a cultural imprint that remains and is well disseminated.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving credible historical evidence and are not recognized as separate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the initial thirteen states established a loose central government - consisting only of Congress - according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial branch, they had to rely on the authority of the states, which often refused to cooperate, to enforce any decisions.
It also does not have the authority to amend tariff laws or tariff schedules between states.
The amendments to the regulations require the consensus of all states, and the states are so indifferent to the central government that the state representatives are often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the champion of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions with Italians competing at international arenas and the Olympic events.
With nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu Island), Japan becomes the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the presence of clusters/groups of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective.
Taiwan originated in the 15th century when European sailors traveled by ship and recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning to change the grain farming practices of the local people and hiring Chinese workers to work on their rice fields and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the army of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) controlled the coastal areas on the western and northern parts of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Dynasty in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, whereby it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, and Japan ruled Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the perimeter of the complex have been reconstructed to help visitors visualize their original appearance more clearly.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most popular still photography format in the world is 35mm, the film size prevalent before the end of the analog film era.
It is still in production to this day, but more importantly, the aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The actual 35 mm format is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, which is somewhat confusing.
Therefore, the aspect ratio for this format (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS format set) are equivalent to or approximately this aspect ratio.
The often mocked and abused rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while still being used as a measure of order in a photo.
According to this rule, the most effective position for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, began to be scrutinized.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has become the link between European nations, despite the differences in language and customs remaining.
Its comprehensive power has affected everyone, from royalty to commoners.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the funds contributed to the church exist for that purpose.
The central agency of the church has been located in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth has led many to question whether the aforementioned teachings are being followed.
After the conflict broke out, England immediately deployed a blockade on the German navy.
This strategy has proven effective by cutting off military and civilian supply lines, although this blockade violated widely accepted international law, as defined by many international agreements over the past two centuries.
He laid mines in international waters to prevent any ship from entering the entire ocean area, endangering even neutral ships.
There was not much reaction to this tactic. Therefore, Germany also expected to receive a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing view of most citizens and nations was inclined towards pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the devastation and brutality of war through World War I, countries all wanted to avoid repeating that situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla arrived in the United States to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to America with only 4 cents to his name, a collection of poems, and a letter of introduction from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of presenting different eras; each period of China or each family that held power corresponded to a different dynasty.
Moreover, between the dynasties were periods of instability when the provinces were divided. The most famous period was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars occurred among many battles between the nobles to seize the throne.
The Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying just to vie for the throne in the great hall of the city of Xi'an.
There are many political and social impacts such as the use of the metric system, the transition from an absolute monarchy to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to any ruler.
Additionally, after the Revolution, professions opened up for all men to apply for jobs, helping the most ambitious ones succeed.
This is also true for the military because military ranking is based on qualities instead of ranks.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries, prompting them to rise up in rebellion.
Muhammad deeply cared about issues beyond this mundane life. He often went to a cave called "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) to contemplate.
Timeless, the Hira Cave preserves vivid images of the spiritual trends left by Saint Mohammed.
Located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even when people know it exists. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
There is nothing but the high, clear sky beautifully enveloping the mountain ranges. A small world known and heard of from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures constructed to commemorate the deceased Pharaoh.
Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Tombs, has many pyramids (including the Great Pyramid, which is the largest pyramid), many smaller tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinx statue.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's consorts and family members.
The "rising tone mark" looks like a V and the "falling tone mark" resembles a clip or a square missing its bottom edge.
"Up" means you should start from the frog and push the bow upward, and "down" means you should start from the frog (the part where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow downward.
Bowing up tends to create a gentler sound, while bowing down produces a more powerful and assertive sound.
Feel free to mark, but remember that the printed curves have musical significance, so please respect them.
On October 6, 1789, while at the Palace of Versailles, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and his sister - Madam Elizabeth were forced to return to Paris in fear by a crowd of women vendors from the market.
On the carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the carriage window.
One person in the crowd waved the head of a slain royal soldier in front of the horrified Queen at the Palace of Versailles.
The cost of the war of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover most of the expenses and interest on bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through banks on Wall Street.
Of course, the superprofits obtained from exploiting the Filipino people over a long period have become the main source of revenue for American imperialism.
To understand the organization of the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that prompted its emergence.
The period when these events took place is often referred to as the High Middle Ages, a phase in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages occurred after the Early Middle Ages and before the Late Middle Ages, conventionally ending around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses many ideas in reality, from promoting or coercing technology to the narrow meaning that human fate is controlled by an implicit logical system linked to scientific laws and manifested in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: the development of technology follows its own path, unaffected by culture and politics, and technology, in turn, exerts an "influence" on pre-existing societies, rather than societies shaping it.
For instance, one could say that cars running on engines inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The excessive number of people owning cars has also led to an increase in the number of traffic accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in the medical field to heal injuries on the body.
Romanticism has a significant element of cultural determination, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes each individual and over time, customs and culture related to that area develop, and these combine with social status, which is still preferable to authoritarian laws being imposed.
Just as Paris is referred to as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was famously the focus of luxury starting around 400 BC and lasting until about 1100 AD.
The position of this city declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders returned the gifts they brought, such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
At this time, the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the mid-10th to 11th century and the 14th century.
At first, the attire was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to delayed communication channels, the style in the West could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. The result of the Crusades brought about one of the most important developments at that time, which was that people began to use buttons.
Subsistence agriculture is a form of farming conducted solely to meet the food needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, usually only using organic fertilizers, stored seeds of local plant varieties combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize productivity.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
The group culture brings together individuals with similar mindsets who feel marginalized by social norms and helps them achieve a sense of belonging.
Subcultures can differ based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The factors determining the cultural differences between regions can be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a cultural group often express relationships through the use of distinctive and symbolic styles such as fashion, speech, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite some unfortunate cases of children involving neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, lacking social contact from their caregivers as they grow up.
Such children are called "wild" or feral. Some wild children have been kept in captivity (often by their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child is due to the parents rejecting the child with severe intellectual or physical impairments.
Street children may have been cruelly abused or traumatized before being abandoned or running away.
Some are said to have been raised by animals; some are believed to have had to survive on their own in the wild.
When completely raised by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limitations) almost entirely similar to the animals that cared for them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more enjoyable, the Scaffolding educational method goes a step further.
Modeling is not a method of learning but a means of assistance for those who are undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Lesson plans can be in physical or virtual form; in other words, the teacher is a type of lesson plan but like a small virtual assistant in Microsoft Office.
The virtual Scaffolds method is internalized in the software and is intended to question, remind, and explain processes that can challenge students to solve problems on their own.
Children are placed in Alternative Care for various reasons, from neglect to abuse or even abduction.
No child deserves to grow up in an environment that lacks nurturing, care, and education, which they are currently experiencing.
We recognize that the Foster Care System is a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system needs to provide a safe shelter, dedicated caregivers, a stable educational environment, and reliable medical care.
The shelter is considered a place that provides the essentials that the children's previous home could not meet.
The Internet combines elements of both community communication and personal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to many new aspects of usage and approaches to satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Degree of self-engagement" and "continuous correlation" are also seen as new motivational directions according to Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated readers' responses to electronic websites.
The use of video cameras has led to important discoveries in interpreting fleeting expressions, which are movements that occur in just a few milliseconds of the face.
Specifically, it is believed that one can detect someone lying by accurately interpreting each micro-expression.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks points out how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess honesty.
He even believes that these abilities to interpret human behavior may also appear in other animal species, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century studies have demonstrated that there are two groups of genetic variations: recessive and dominant.
Mutations introduce new genetic variants and selection removes them from the group of expressed variants.
Separation and recombination occur back and forth between the two groups through each generation.
In the desert, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to satisfy the requirement for essential amino acids from available plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so will lead to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The fastest accessible plant sources are likely the proteins in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
On the other hand, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest but also provides a rich source of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
After considering everything, we should not be surprised if our ancestors addressed the "protein issue" in a similar manner to how chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep intervention is the process of intentionally waking someone during their normal sleeping time and then allowing them to fall back asleep a short while later (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using an almost silent alarm clock to help you wake up without being fully awakened.
If you find yourself often resetting the clock when you sleep, you can place the clock in another corner of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Choices based on circadian rhythms, including drinking a lot of fluids (specifically water or tea, which are known as diuretics) before sleeping, will make us wake up to urinate.
Inner peace is inversely proportional to the stress that the body and mind have to endure.
The more stress is reduced, the more positive energy is present. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders us on this path is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but is expanded by the Mahayana path of compassion and many Indian Yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path encompassing love.
According to Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightening energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through visualizing the forms of different deities, pure energy fields and chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was once a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. At the end of World War II, conflicts over systems, processes, and culture caused these countries to become divided again.
In the two years that ended the war, former allies became enemies again, and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish line had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans collapsed almost overnight, as more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops advanced and formed the Belarus and Ukraine front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Non-Aggression Convention between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transporting goods is the most effective method at present for moving large numbers of people and goods across the sea.
The traditional mission of the naval forces is to ensure the maintenance of the country's ability to transport people and goods, while also interfering with the movement of people and goods of the enemy.
One of the most notable recent examples is the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. The United States endeavored to transport supplies and rations across the Atlantic to assist England.
Meanwhile, the German navy also used U-boats to try to block this shipping flow.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have conquered England after having defeated the rest of Europe.
The goat was first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping these animals for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats are often raised in herds, wandering for food on hills or other grazing areas, mainly herded by children or teenagers, similar to shepherding sheep. These herd-based livestock farming methods are still in use today.
The carriageways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the wagon roads consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull at a faster speed and carry a larger load of goods compared to traveling on the rough daily roads.
The tie bars were known quite early to keep the rails in position; however, gradually it was realized that these rails would work more effectively if there was a small metal piece at the head.
This has become customary, however iron has caused horse carriage wheels to wear out faster.
"Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced."
The first known form of transportation is walking, humans began walking two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright human).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus apes, did not have an upright gait.
The bipedal characteristics are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can participate in the environmental movement, and we can even become environmental activists to somewhat alleviate the burden on the future.
This is similar to treating symptoms in many cases. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root cause of the problem and figure out how to neutralize it.
It is clear that the world has changed tremendously thanks to the achievements in human science and technology, and the issues have also become more severe due to excessive population growth along with the excessive lifestyle of humans.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft signed by Speaker of the House John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the print shop of John Dunlap a few buildings away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, known today as the "Dunlap Broadsides."
The first reading of this document was by John Nixon at Independence Hall on July 8th.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his army in New York on July 9. A copy was delivered to London on August 10.
25 Dunlap copies are believed to still be the oldest surviving reproductions of this document. The original handwritten copy no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and still exist today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think this creature is a dinosaur because it has feathers and can fly.
However, birds still have many similarities with dinosaurs.
Their legs are scaly and clawed. They lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like T-Rexes.
Almost every computer we are using today is based on transforming information encoded in binary form.
Binary numbers can only take one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary sequences - or "bits", used in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not show clear symptoms immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are often not sufficient for an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest sign of organ poisoning is likely the presence of an opened container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in an official sense to designate this group of insects.
This term originates from ancient familiarity with the Bed Bug, an insect highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both blood-sucking bugs and bedbugs are late-dispersing species, adapted to living in nests or on hosts.
Across the United States, there are currently about 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This number has made Multiple Sclerosis the leading common neurological disease among young and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
The study found that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or that of the child.
These couples have decided to plan to adopt a child.
In the adoption agreement, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise their child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world operates through scientific methods. This method has in fact guided most scientific research.
However, not only experimentation and experimentation are experiments used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses posed to ask questions and make observations that also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially the Latin Bible.
Accept Aristotle's views on all issues related to science, including psychology.
As the understanding of Greece declined, the West found itself cut off from the Greek philosophical and scientific origins.
Many rhythms observed in psychology and behavior often heavily depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and the production of these rhythms through the biological clock.
The circadian rhythm, not simply a response to external periodic signals, has been observed in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators and will continue free-running cycle timing even in the absence of external influences.
Hershey and Chase's experiment is one of the compelling pieces of evidence showing that DNA is a type of genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to label the DNA sequences inside the bacteriophage with a radioactive phosphorus compound or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Genetic mutations can cause various effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the impacted gene segment, and whether the affected cell is a germ cell or not.
Only mutations in the germline cells of bacteria can be passed on to the offspring, while mutations elsewhere may cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts travelers who enjoy visiting natural areas to immerse themselves in the scenery of nature along with the flora and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird-watching, visiting parks, and researching information about ecosystems.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive away from small towns to get to work, passing by others heading to the very place they just left to work.
In the system of dynamic shuttle transportation, everyone is connected to and supports a transportation system with their own car.
Today, science suggests that this massive carbon-based economy has pushed the biosphere out of the stable state that has allowed humans to evolve over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about these transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why does the transportation system cause complaints, and why do they frequently make mistakes? Could it be that the transportation engineers are not qualified enough? Or is there a more fundamental reason at play?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points as well as how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is very difficult to study traffic flow because it is not possible to predict drivers' behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within acceptable limits; therefore, traffic flows tend to be reasonably consistent and can be roughly expressed mathematically.
To better simulate traffic flow, the relationship between three main characteristics has been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly into the air. The ability to fly helps them avoid predators more easily and search for food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
Thanks to that, they can hide in small places to escape predators.
Nowadays, the only types of insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people think that he was right, but many believe the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and also the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest river and the second longest in the world. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river on earth, at times it is even six miles wide.
20% of the water flowing from the rivers on this planet into the ocean originates from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramid complex could never surpass their size and perfect construction techniques.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were astounded by the works of their ancestors, which still endured a thousand years later.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous country.
The Vatican City uses Italian in law and official communication.
Italian is used as a daily language by people working in the state, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All the residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Humans have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because all of these elements can be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed the hypothesis that everything is composed of the combination of one or more of the four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
This is akin to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he hypothesized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Basically, an alloy is a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like gold and silver.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made up of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of atoms can be only as large as a period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, from the very beginning of its creation, the pencil has become a good friend to many people.
Sadly, as new writing methods emerged, pencils gradually lost their place and were increasingly less used.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens, never having to use a pencil sharpener anymore.
One can only wonder what fate awaits the keyboard when something newer emerges.
Fission bombs operate on the principle of using energy to combine atomic nuclei with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Shift gears once more and then release some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to break apart with little or no impact.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and about 100 kilometers thick on the far side of the Moon.
It is thinner under the maria (seas) region and thicker in the highlands.
There may be many catchment areas affected on the adjacent slopes because the crust is thinner. Lava rises to the surface more easily.
Content theories focus on identifying what captures people's attention or attracts them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are acquired externally as they grow up.
These theories consider what motivates some people to do the things they want and what elements in the environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theoretical contents are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, there are two types of conduct that may occur when a manager begins to lead former colleagues. The first is trying to maintain a close relationship.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and keeping people working responsibly.
Some people will transform into a completely different person and feel that they have to change everything the whole group is doing and do it themselves.
After all, the leader must take absolute responsibility for the success and failure of the group.
This action sometimes leads to a rift between the leader and others in the team.
Remote teams must meet quality standards like traditional teams, but there are still small differences.
Members of the virtual team often take on functions as the point of contact for team members who are close to them.
They often have more autonomy than regular members because their team can meet on different timelines, which may not be sympathized with by their local management.
The presence of the "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a special component of the virtual team.
The "invisible group" is the management group to which each member will report. The invisible group sets standards for each member.
Why must an organization undergo the time-consuming process of establishing an educational institution? One goal of putting organized learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and cleverness can be unleashed.
Therefore, the process of organizing collaboration to overcome a certain obstacle can lead to a new improvement process to serve the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be creative, the leadership needs to create a culture of creativity as well as share the knowledge and exploration of the entire team.
Angel (2006) explains that the Continuous method is a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neuroscientific data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research process.
For a long time, we have known that different types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause alterations in certain neurological functions.
The development of new technology allows us to observe and study brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the brain's processes.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) is very significant in the science fiction industry, AI also shapes an incredibly important branch in computer science, handling behaviors, possessing the ability to learn and be sensitive, and simulating intelligence in machines.
Research in Artificial Intelligence involves creating machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become individual rules, focusing on providing solutions to practical problems in life.
Today's AI (artificial intelligence) systems are often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, as well as in many home computer applications and video game software.
Field trips are an important part of the class. Teachers quite often take students to places where taking the bus is not an option.
Technology provides solutions through virtual reality trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful artworks while sitting in class.
Sharing the field trip online is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future students.
For example, each year, students from Bennet School in North Carolina will design a website about their trip to the State Capital. Each year, this website is redesigned, however, the old versions are kept online as souvenirs.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills. When they start blogging, these students often make grammatical and spelling errors out of carelessness, but the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Students are often the harshest critics, so the blog author began trying to improve the quality of the writing to avoid criticism.
Simultaneously, blogging "compels students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The necessity to nurture audience interest inspires students to become intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are tools that stimulate collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning beyond the confines of traditional classrooms.
The appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more adept at analytical and reasoning skills; through positive engagement with online materials, students can identify their role in the context of others' writings as well as express their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada, home to numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's historical and modern artifacts.
Farther south is Niagara Falls and to the north is Muskoka with its pristine natural beauty and more.
All of this and more highlights how Ontario is perceived by outsiders as the essence of Canada.
Large areas further to the north have a rather sparse population, and some regions are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A comparison about population might surprise many people: There are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are part of the Indian Ocean, near the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest area and is a continent dedicated to wildlife.
Most of the smaller archipelagos are independent countries, or associated with France, and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the lands, and it spread widely in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
This area borders Sahei to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: Female tourists should say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing rings will also have an effect (only those that don't look too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to a situation that they consider harassment, and acts like following, holding arms, etc. are very normal.
Be decisive when refusing, and don't hesitate to stand your ground (whether there are cultural differences or not, that does not turn wrong into right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port named Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, and it was only abandoned after the earthquake of 1755.
The Kingdom of Morocco rebuilt this city similar to Daru l-Badya and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop across Morocco.
Around the old Medina area, it is easy to find traditional Moroccan goods such as Tagine pots, ceramics, leather products, Shisha, and various knick-knacks but only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was leveled by the Nyiragongo volcano. This volcanic eruption disaster buried most of the city, especially the downtown area.
Although Goma is still within the allowable safety limits, any visit from outside this city still needs to be thoroughly researched to understand the current combat situation existing in this North Kivu province.
This city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest Gorilla Mountain tracking equipment in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to explore Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for that short trip.
With its relatively inaccessible features, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for remote and exotic lands.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a poor town, although its reputation attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the encroachment of desert sand.
That is one of the main stops in the special television program Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates on PBS.
This city contrasts completely with other cities in the country because it embodies more of an Arab style than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of over 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each home to a unique wildlife habitat.
This is one of the main tourist attractions in South Africa and it is considered the flagship location of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all National Parks in South Africa, conservation activities occur daily and an entrance ticket to the park must be purchased.
It is also beneficial for someone to purchase a Wild Card, as it may allow you to enter either parks in South Africa or all the National Parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place many visitors consider the main highlight.
The parade of buildings makes Hong Kong's skyline resemble a sparkling bar chart, accentuated by the presence of the waters in Victoria Harbour.
To see Hong Kong from its most beautiful angle, leave the island and go straight to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
Most of Hong Kong's urban areas have been developed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place the British colonists took over as their own, and therefore, if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a very good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland in Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The forest area located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Not only do they have mangrove swamps, but these forests also include some remaining areas of the magnificent forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans has an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is water/swamp regions.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in this area.
The buses depart from the inter-district bus station (along the river) all day, though primarily, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, will depart from 06:30 to 07:30.
Because inter-district buses are often fully booked, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are very comfortable and sturdy.
Carpooling by taxi is a convenient and quick way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. This bridge spans the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil to Saint-Georges de l’Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters tall, 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.5 meters wide.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to officially operate in September 2017, when Brazil's customs stations are completed, as planned.
Guaraní is the largest indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, with a semi-nomadic hunting lifestyle and subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco area is home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who live by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," came into being after encounters between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish initiated a colonial period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the establishment of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has endeavored to maintain its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the world's best polo teams and players.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also take place here at other times of the year.
To find information about the tournament and where to buy polo match tickets, please visit the Argentine Polo Association's website.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged at par with the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the island, located on Stanley Street opposite the FIC West shop.
In general, the British pound will be accepted anywhere on the islands and, within Stanley, credit cards and the US dollar are also commonly accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are likely not to be accepted, although British or American money might be; check with the owner beforehand to know which payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside of these islands, so make sure to exchange your money before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located in the Southern Hemisphere, summer there is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures are usually above +30°C.
Winter can be cold in a misleading way: the temperature rarely drops to freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the temperature displayed on the thermometer.
There is no distinct "rainy" or "dry" season: the rainfall throughout the year is almost unchanged.
Even though many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wild animals are still wildlife and should not be fed or teased.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how gentle they look, bison, elk, moose, bears, and nearly all large animals can attack people.
Every year, dozens of tourists get injured because they don't maintain a safe distance. These animals are very large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their own space.
In addition, be aware of scents that might attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking odorous foods and maintain cleanliness around the camping area.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and officially became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
This harbor was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and England refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German sailors were killed.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III being killed.
There are many beaches because Auckland is situated between two harbors. The most famous beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) belong to the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of them are safe sandy beaches for swimming, and most have shade from Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located on Waitemata Harbour in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with many shops along the coast. It is safe to swim here.
Local beer is mainly 'Number One', which is not a mixed beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many types of French wine you need to have, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be less affected when moved.
The local tap water is absolutely safe to drink, but bottled water is also readily available if you are concerned about this issue.
For Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is unfamiliar. Short black coffee is 'espresso,' cappuccino coffee is topped with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate according to Belgian standards. The fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
There are many tours to this coral reef year-round, and injuries caused by this coral reef are rare.
However, follow the recommendations of the authorities, comply with all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of the 1770 area. Occasionally, they can also be encountered outside this time period.
Sharks do appear but rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of people and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not usually live in the sea; their main habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance assures travelers that they will have a place to stay when they arrive.
Travel agencies often partner with certain hotels, although you can book other types of accommodations like campsites through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer service packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even combine both airline tickets and hotel accommodations.
They can also reserve a spot for you if you need time to consider the job offer or handle other documents related to your destination (such as a visa).
However, any request or adjustment situation must not be sent directly to the hotel but must first be handled through the travel agency.
For some festivals, a large number of attendees decide to camp on-site, and most of them consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the activity area, you need to arrive early to secure a camping spot near the sound system.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage has stopped, there are still some areas of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the sleeping cabin again, because when the icebreaker operates, it will create terrible noises that not everyone can endure.
The travel time of the Saint Petersburg train includes time within the city. Passengers on the train are exempt from visas (check the terms).
Casinos often try to make customers spend as much time and money as possible. These places usually do not have windows and clocks, and the exits are also very hard to find.
They often provide special foods, drinks, and entertainment to keep customers comfortable and stay.
Some venues serve alcoholic beverages on site. However, intoxication impairs judgment and all savvy gamblers understand the importance of keeping a clear mind.
Anyone who wants to drive in high-altitude areas or over passes needs to consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
The friction on icy and snow-covered roads is low, making it impossible for you to drive as if you were driving on a normal asphalt road.
If there is a snowstorm, even a short period of snowfall can be enough to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be reduced due to falling or blowing snow or condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal phenomena in many countries, and traffic is almost uninterrupted year-round.
Safari is probably the most popular tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many travelers.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to overland travel to observe wildlife in Africa, particularly the Savanna.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes often come close to vehicles, and with only ordinary tools, we can also observe them easily.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can sometimes be very cautious, so to see them more clearly you should use binoculars.
The walking safari journey (also known as “recreational forest walking”, “exploratory hiking”, or “trekking”) includes hiking for several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at different locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, having previously hosted the Olympics in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodations for the year 2020 before the postponement announcement, you might be in a predicament.
Cancellation policies vary. However, as of the end of March, most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus do not allow extensions until July 2020 - the time when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most event tickets will be priced between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available to borrow, even if you don't see one in the room.
If there is no iron or if you don't like wearing socks, you can use a hairdryer if you have one.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (it may shrink, or in severe cases, it can catch fire).
There are many ways to filter water, among which there are very effective methods to eliminate specific risks.
In some places, it's enough to boil water for one minute, while in others, it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters is not the same, so if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from reputable companies.
Tourists might encounter harmful animals that they have never seen in their own country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst-case scenario, trigger allergies, spread toxins, or transmit infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill by force, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from value-added tax and excise tax at certain locations.
Tourists visiting countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.
The long distance between Point Marion and Fairmont creates the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through solitary wooded areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, you should brace yourself for steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The speed limit enforced in this area is significantly lower compared to the sections of the road before and after it - the common speed falls around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to these regulations is extremely important.
Strangely, naturally, the mobile phone service is much stronger here compared to many other extended regions along this route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite delicious, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and diverse, similar to the neighboring country to the south, Austria.
Fruit cakes are very popular here, with apples used to make cakes year-round, while cherries and plums are also used in the summer.

The stirrup is a tool that supports the rider, hanging down from the saddle for both feet.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may pose safety concerns due to the potential for foot entrapment.
If a horse rider falls but gets their foot stuck in the saddle, they might be dragged along if the horse continues to run. To minimize this risk, several preventative measures can be taken.
First, most horse riders wear boots with high heels and smooth, fairly narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have a safety bar that allows the leather strap to fall away from the saddle if the rider is pulled backward in a fall.

Mountain skiing: This activity is also known as cross-country skiing, touring skiing, or walking skiing.
It is related, but usually does not include styles like hiking or climbing using Alpine-style skis; the latter is done on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the skiing journey as similar to a hiking journey.
Under favorable conditions, you may cover a longer distance walking – but it's very rare to reach the speed of cross-country skiing without having to carry a heavy backpack and being able to ski on flat terrain.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Typically, traveling through many countries means having to apply for visas and have passports checked multiple times.

A rip current is a stream of water flowing back from the waves crashing onto the beach, usually at a sandbar or a similar place.
Due to the underwater terrain structure, reverse currents concentrate in certain deeper areas, and quick currents flowing to deep waters can form there.
Most of the deaths are due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which seems impossible.
As soon as you get out of the whirlpool, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try swimming in a direction where you won't be swept away by the current, or choose to stay in one place to wait for rescue, depending on your own skills and whether someone has noticed your dangerous situation or not.

On some routes, large companies often have private planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, this is an issue.
If they ship goods by air, on some routes it may take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to send the goods faster is to send them as checked baggage. Aviation regulations do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, and that's where you come in.

However, the cost is not cheap: as a general rule, you may have to pay four times the price of an economy ticket for a business class ticket, and eleven times for a first-class ticket!
Generally, it would be useless to hunt for discounts on business class or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
