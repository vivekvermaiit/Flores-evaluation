This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a well-known theory already, but could not generally present fossils with details like color and three-dimensional design.
Scientists say that the feathers of the animal were chestnut brown on the upper part with a lower part light-colored or carrot-colored.
The discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the feathers of the dinosaur do not have a well-developed shaft, which is called a 'rachis', but do have other characteristics of feathers – barbs and barbules – the researcher deduced that the 'rachis' probably developed later in evolution than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used during flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, although this was the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not chick down.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to stimulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of our galaxy.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the world, causing tides, our galaxy also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in a similar way that regular matter does.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy remains around the galaxy in a sort of halo, and is made up of different small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed paper with their chosen candidate's indication in an envelope.
After the employees verified the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in a box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law codifies the process quite strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot box must be transparent so that the voters and observers can witness that there are no ballots at the beginning of the voting and that no ballots enter that are not from the voters who are counted and correctly authorized.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following a specific procedure.

That man's weapon fired while it was resting on the head of one of five men. Schneider has continuous pain, was blind in one eye, and had part of his skull and face that was missing reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via a video link from a USAF base in his country.
In addition to the event on Thursday, Carpanedo competed in two individual tournaments at the championships.
His first event was the Slalom, where he received a Did Not Finish in his first race. 36 of the 116 competitors achieved the same result in the race.
In her other race, the Giant Slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's group with a combined race time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winner, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's group did not finish their runs, and 45 of the total 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom did not classify in the race.
Police in Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and the mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, “We arrested five people who violated the Swiss woman and recovered her cell phone and her laptop."
Named the accused as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from the crashed Audi TT.
Initially, it was placed in James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterwards, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Akedoya from that time is in the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh under the accusation of having killed her son.
He will be keeping eyewear and case in court, but all eyewitness evidence may be compromised because his photo was published in many places.
This is a common practice everywhere else in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish judiciary works differently, and the courts have seen the publication of portraits as a potential prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that “it seems like journalists are walking a dangerous path if they publish pictures etc. of suspects.”
Crown Office, which is completely in charge of the prosecution, indicated to journalists that no further comments would be given at least until the accusation.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, with Palestine wanting to base it on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Another topic covered includes the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the matter of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow this presence only for five years.
The World Guardian had to supervise shooters in the supplementary case of controlling harmful animals meticulously, as they were monitoring the court case and evaluating its effectiveness.
In a collaboration between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Deputy Director of Conservation and Heritage of the Park with NWPS, the four shooters selected for the first culling operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
It's Martelly's fifth CEO position in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the removal of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests became violent due to the failure to hold elections, which should have taken place since 2011.
Reportedly, there have been over 60 cases of iPods malfunctioning by overheating, which caused a total of six fires and left four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) (Ministry of Economy, Commerce, and Industry) stated that they were aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company declared as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The emergency management office of the Northern Marianas said that no damage was reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued and so far at least 6 people have been confirmed dead.
They released six hostages early, including children, adults, and the Filipino photographers.
After that the photographers took the place of a tall person who had to go to the bathroom. They shot Mendoza dead.
Liggins followed his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women’s Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births during his free time.
His research showed that administering this hormone would accelerate the development of the baby's lungs in the mother's womb.
Xinhua reported that government investigators discovered two flight recorders 'black box' yesterday.
Her fellow fighters also came to honor Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of a full moon. Quite unique, just like herself. A strong woman."
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “Luna was as strange as me... maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place.”
Of the 1,400 people who were surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those who are against Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent from 2008.
Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign said that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the survey share this idea, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of those questioned find that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist had to swim in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her injuries, her health was in doubt.
He cannot take the necessary medicines to treat his pain, because those are prohibited in that Country.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25.
Different people verified the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February and announced it on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets could have been a source of water supply for Earth along with organic materials that could form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, from the times when comets collided with Earth many times in the past.
Cuomo, 53, began as governor earlier this year and last month signed a law to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as “chatter and political nonsense”.
It is speculated that he/she/they will try to run for presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims can allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the older land-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to mark the position of an aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no extra transport and the overground train will not stop at Wembley, and the car park and ride facilities will not be available at the site.
Fear of lack of transportation increased the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new species of bird on the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although they thought that this process would take much more time, due to the breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take all sorts of shapes. It can be beaten into very thin forms.
You can make it a thin wire that can bend and flex. You can hit it with a hammer or file it into a fine blade.
It can be made very fine, and attached to another metal. It can be so fine that it was used in the past to decorate hand-painted pages in books called “illuminated manuscripts.”
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the juice changes depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
Indicates the pH level with the amount of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons with their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean dry hands, press them together to make a ball.
The moisture of your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and will form a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet that could be found in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remnants of sewer systems have been found in the homes of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, there were times toilets were part of public baths where men and women were together in each other's company.
If you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
Sent the satellite into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and view a little.
Need a giant rocket over 100 feet tall to place a satellite or a telescope in space.
He wanted to change the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing he wanted to do for us is to give us easier and faster transportation.
He gave us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are more medium-sized feline animals that eat prey from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small feline animals (including house cats) that eat a significantly larger amount of small prey like insects, lizards, and frogs.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that each cat has to perform so that it does not compete with another cat.
Leon is the most social feline animal, living in large groups called prides.
Groups typically consist of one to three adult males, along with up to thirty female lions and cubs.
The women usually are family close to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave very much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that surprisingly are similar to lions (but not to other big feline animals) in their behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
As a good athlete, the tiger can climb (not very well), swim, jump very far distances, and pull with five times more strength than a person.
Tiger is in the same genus (Genus Panthera) as lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four feline animals are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full voice of a lion, but more like a sentence of rough and loud words.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) through scent, smelling where they were on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they move very stealthily as well. Ocelots hunt their prey by hiding in their environment and then jumping out onto their prey.
If a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they originated from (such as by crossing a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island in a way that makes it difficult to return), often they will find themselves in a different environment than they were in previously.
The new environment here has different sources of support and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor like they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
As time passes, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, they start to resemble the other population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will seem so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process species formation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Species formation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale (this is taken in through their leaves).
Plants make food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the most ferocious beast of its time, that means it was not afraid of anything, except for other mosasauruses.
His long jaws are filled with more than 70 sharp teeth like blades, along with an extra set in the roof of his mouth, meaning that there was no escape for anything that came across it.
We are not sure, but maybe it had a forked tongue. It ate large turtles, big fish, other types of mosasaurus, and maybe it was even a cannibal.
Also, it attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex could not handle it.
While most of their food might be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or exceptional foods to taste, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called 'dormouse'.
Another difference was that while poor people and the women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men enjoyed having their banquets together lying on their sides while they ate their food.
Ancient Roman food could not contain edibles that entered Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, nor did any ancient Roman ever get to taste a turkey.
The Babylonians built a large temple for each of their gods, which they considered the house of the god.
People used to bring sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to attend to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an outer temple court and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special towers in the shape of a pyramid, called 'ziggurats', were constructed to become part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not that important.
Most of the family's life took place outdoors.
Women used to cook in the backyard, kitchens were simply benches open to the street. They used stones to build houses.
There was no large forest in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland due to murder, and on his westward journey, he reached Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, despite its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Despite the fact that each nation was from ‘Scandinavia’, there were many differences between the people, kingdoms, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might think there was a treasure map written backwards on the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Even though there is something written on the back of the document, it was not a treasure map.
Behind the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" are written. The text appears at the bottom of the document, head down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote this, it is known that early in its existence, the large parchment document (it measured 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to preserve it.
Well, probably just tagged it as a label.
The D-Day landings and the following battles liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part was not yet liberated.
The French "Vichy" were in power. There were people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the southern part of France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks the American and French forces liberated the southern part of France and took the road towards Germany.
A civilization is a particular culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to civis in Latin, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this also in one way or another defines the scope of society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge through different generations, a persistent cultural mark, and a fair distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence behind and fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government—with Congress as its only component—under the arrangement of the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have any power to impose taxes, and, due to not having a national executive or judicial power, it depended on state authorities, who often did not cooperate, to implement all its laws.
He also did not have the authority to override fiscal laws and tariffs between the states.
The arrangement of the Articles of Confederation required a unanimous agreement from all the states before they could be amended, and the states did not take the central government very seriously, with their representatives regularly absent.
The national football team of Italy, together with the national football team of Germany, are the two most victorious teams in the world and were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest one being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, it is often referred to in Japan, on a geographical level, as an “archipelago.”
Taiwan's beginning started from the 15th century when European navigators passing by registered the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, initiating a transformation of native wheat production practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western part of Taiwan and the northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, they are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings at the edge of the complex were reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally were.
Since 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu has been reconstructed and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common fixed image photograph format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
Until now it is being produced, but more importantly, the sensor of the digital camera format has inherited its image proportions.
The 35mm format is actually, a bit confusing, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect of the proportion of this format (divide the twelves to obtain the easiest proportion of a whole number) therefore means that it is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats, for example) are the same thing or almost the same thing with the aspect of approximate proportion.
The rule of thirds, often abused and frequently ridiculed, is simply a guide to create a dynamic while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
He says that the most effective place for the main subject is an intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under critical investigation.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has united European states despite differences in language and customs.
His power that penetrates everywhere affected everyone from king to common citizen.
One of the major Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are specifically for that purpose.
The central authority of the church had been established in Rome for more than a thousand years, and the concentration of power and capital here made many people question whether this was in line with the basic principle.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by various international agreements over the last two centuries.
Great Britain laid international mines to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, causing danger even to some neutral ships.
Because there was a limited reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the predominant attitude of many citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and cruelties of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to accept a job at Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way to show different periods of time; each phase of China or each ruling family had a different dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty, there was a period of instability with divided provinces. The best-known of these periods is the era of the Three Kingdoms, taking place for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, fierce battles took place among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi’an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution, vacancies were open to everyone, men who applied, allowing the most ambitious and successful ones to succeed.
The same thing applies to military personnel because in the past their positions in the army were based on class, now on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people from the working class or from other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the mundane life. He frequently visited a cave known as "Hira" on the "Noor" (light) mountain for contemplation.
The cave itself, having survived the ages, provides a vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Situated on top of one of the northern mountains of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not easy to find it even though you knew it existed. Once inside the cave, it's total isolation.
Cannot see anything else but the clear sky, beautiful sky above, and the many stars that surround it. Few things of this world can be seen or heard in the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the only seven wonders that still stands today.
Constructed by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small graves, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
They created the great pyramid to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, the tombs, and the temples are made to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "arrow mark up" looks like a V and the "arrow mark down" looks like a notch or a rectangle without its bottom side.
Above means that you should start at the tip and grip the bow, and below means that you should start at the handle (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A high register usually creates a softer sound, while a low register is more harsh and stronger.
Feel free to write in your own notes, but remember that the printed marks are there for a musical purpose, so generally they must be respected.
Startled, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old), and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced on October 6, 1789, to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and expressing threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open their carriage window wide open.
At a given moment, a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the Queen, who was mortified and frightened.
The costs of the American imperialist war for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were obliged to pay taxes under the American colonial regime to finance a major part of the expenses and the interest on obligations in the name of the government of the Philippines through Wall Street banking companies.
Naturally, the profits derived from the long exploitation of the people of the Philippines will form the basic profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that motivated the creation of the order.
The era in which these events took place is generally known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the last part of the Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological push or the technological imperative to a strict sense where human destiny is determined by a logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
The majority of interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely uninfluenced by cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the car necessarily drives on the development of the road.
However, a network of roads throughout the entire country is not economically feasible for just a few cars, which means that new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Having excessive control over a car also leads to more car accidents on the road, which leads to the invention of new health care techniques to correct bodies that have suffered damage.
Romanticism had a great element of determination, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time the customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and these, in harmony with the position of society, were better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began around 400 A.D. and continued until 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the participants of the Crusade returned with gifts such as silk fabrics and spices that had more value than what the Byzantine market was offering.
It was this time that the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital took place from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style became very popular during the period between the 10th – 11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture from the East.
However, due to the slow communication of the channels, fashion in the West is walking 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time was a result of the Crusades, with many people starting to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture aimed at producing enough food to meet the sufficient needs of the farmer and their family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses native seeds preserved from the ecosystem to combine with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, the majority of farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring individuals together with the same mindset who feel neglected by the standards of society and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or the gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often demonstrate their membership through a distinctive and symbolic form of style usage, which includes fashions, customs, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to make use of the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, setbacks, or intentional abuse, could not be socialized through adults during their upbringing.
The type of children here we call "wild" or savage. Some wild children would be locked at home by people (usually their own parents); in some of these cases, the abandonment of these children was due to the parents' rejection because of a child's severe intellectual or physical limitations.
Angry children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others supposedly were created to be beasts; some say that they lived in the world by themselves.
When they were raised entirely by non-human animals, the wild children exhibit behavioral patterns (within physical limitations) almost entirely like those of the particular animals that raised them, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based teaching will need to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of teaching but rather an assistance that provides support to individuals who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a type of support but the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office is too.
The virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software and aims to question, motivate, and explain the procedures that may be presented as a challenge for the student to act on their own.
Children are placed in foster families for a wide variety of reasons ranging from negligence, to abuse, and even blackmail.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that doesn't provide food, doesn't provide love, and isn't educational, but this does happen.
We realize that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide a safe home, caregivers who take care of the children with love, stable education, and reliable medical care.
Families with children need to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage focus and gratifications.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as important motivational aspects for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationship" are also aspects of new motivation that Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has brought important discoveries in the interpretation of micro expressions, facial movements that can last a few milliseconds.
Particularly, it's stated that you can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his document The President’s Speech, indicates how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can nonetheless adequately understand sincerity.
He even suggests that abilities like interpreting human behavior could be shared with animals like domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination move variation back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
On the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant sources.
Furthermore, not addressing this has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resource would have been the proteins available in seeds and beans, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking them.
In contrast, animal foods (beef, chicken, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they provide high-quality protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Taking everything into consideration, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that the chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally waking during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep within a short time afterwards (10-60 minutes).
You can do this easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without waking you completely from sleep.
If you find that you set your alarm clock again in your sleep, you can put the alarm clock on the other side of the room, this forces you to get out of bed in order to turn it off.
Another option based on biorhythm involves drinking plenty of liquids (particularly water or tea, they are known to stimulate urination) before going to sleep, forcing you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is presented. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Every person can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
The Buddhism of Tibet is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded by the path of Mahayana love and through many Yoga techniques from India.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of love that encompasses everything.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the illumination of consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the conflict of systems, processes, and cultures led to the end of cooperation between the countries.
With two years of the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and thus the Cold War began.
He would endure over the next 40 years and would go on to engage in real battles, for armies of representatives, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and their only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along with the Romanian fortification.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport products is one of the most efficient ways to move large quantities of people and products across the ocean.
The work of the sailors traditionally was to ensure that your country maintains its ability to transport its people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most recent and remarkable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and material over the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany probably would have been able to conquer Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that approximately 10,000 years ago, goats began to be domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
The ancient tribes and cultures began raising them for easy access to milk, meat, meat, and leather.
They used to generally keep the domesticated goats in large quantities roaming on hills or grassy areas, often tended by goat herders who were frequently children or adolescents, comparable to what the more widely known shepherd is. These methods of herding are still used today.
From the 16th century, horse-drawn trams were constructed in England.
Although the horse trams only consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and haul larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of that day.
Introduced rails with cross connections quickly to hold the rails in place. However, gradually, it was realized that the rails could be more efficient if they had an iron tip on the upper part.
This became a common practice, but the iron was causing more damage to the wooden parts of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rail was introduced.
The first known form of transportation was walking; people started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (humans standing on their bodies).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright regularly.
In the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, specializations were found that were walking on two feet, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to thus reduce future suffering to a certain extent.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want only a temporary solution, then we must seek the root of the problems, and we must deactivate them.
It is sufficiently obvious that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and that problems have become larger because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a clear copy was sent to be written by hand and signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson for printing by John Dunlap just a few streets away.
During the night, between 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first time the document was read publicly was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6 a copy was sent to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. On August 10 a copy reached London.
The 25 “Dunlap broadsides” known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are living today. We call them birds.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about parents that still resemble a dinosaur.
They have scaly legs and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and in computer terminology, these numbers are known as binary digits - or bits.
Internal intoxication will not be immediately evident. Symptoms, such as dizziness, are so general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term is derived from the ancient knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects that are very well adapted to parasitize human beings.
Both the Assassin bug and the bed bug remain far from where they are born, adapted to life in the nests or homes of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), positioning it as the primary neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged adults.
MS is an illness that affects the central nervous system consisting of the brain, spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or their child's interest, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise their child.
The principal objective of science is to find out how the world functions through the scientific method. In fact, it is this method that guides the majority of scientific investigation.
However, it is not only through experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific investigations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, particularly, on the Bible in Latin.
He accepted all of Aristotle's viewpoints on all scientific matters, including psychology.
According to the knowledge of Greek was becoming less, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
For most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, their periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not simply reactions to periodically external signals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that, even when there are no external signals, will continue to operate for a period in a free-running cycle.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phage (small viruses that infect bacteria), or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments by marking either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ line cells.
Only mutations in germ line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts can cause death or cancer.
Tourism based on nature attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including plants and animals in the wild.
Examples of activities at the site include sailing, fishing, taking photos, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work while others whose work destination is the place they just left pass them.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is in one way or another connected to, and supporting, a transport system based on family cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has expelled the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution during the last two million years.
All people participate in society and use transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you very rarely hear of issues similar concerning the quality of drinking water or collapsing bridges.
Why do these transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are the transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it is impossible to predict the behavior of the driver with one-hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave themselves within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be more or less mathematically represented.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operations of road facilities.
Insects are the first animals that flew in the air. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more quickly, find food, and reproduce more efficiently.
The majority of insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings behind their bodies.
This gives them a wider reach to hide in smaller places from their natural enemies.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot bend their wings backwards are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
There are people who thought that he was right but many people thought the opposite; that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems sensible, because the world does not feel like it is moving, or does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest in the world. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest rivers.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, measuring somewhere around six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows into the planet's oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite the fact that the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City's population is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language that the majority of those who work for the state use every day, while Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as they can all be discovered in nature in native form and are relatively easy to obtain with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is composed of a mix of one or more of four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
"Alloy" is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Likewise, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is a matter of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
The parrot was a good friend to many people when it left, then.
Unfortunately, according to newer writing methods, it seemed, the pencil was degraded to a lower status and usage.
Nowadays people are writing messages on computer screens without ever having to come near a typewriter.
A person can only ask themselves what will happen with the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atom bomb functions according to the principle that energy is needed to compose a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like climbing a cart up a hill. Through splitting the nucleus again, at that moment it releases some of that energy.
Certain atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with a small push or no push at all.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas (dark rocks above the moon) and thicker under the more mountainous parts.
There could be more seaweed in the nearby area because the shell is thinner. It was easier for lava flows to come to the surface.
The theories of content focus on discovering what motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature and become adults.
These theories examine what things seem for certain people who desire the things they do and which things in their environment will lead them to act or refrain from certain actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can arise when managers begin to guide their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of them."
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable for damage.
At the other extreme, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels the need to change everything the team has been doing and do it their way.
After all, the leader is the one who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often results in division between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team often function as the point of contact for their direct physical group.
With frequency, they have more autonomy than the members of a conventional team because their team can reach agreements with the different time zones that their local management team might not understand.
The presence of a genuine "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team establishes the standards for each member.
Does an organization want to go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? An objective for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
At the moment of using all the resources available effectively through the functional departments of an organization, creativity and inventiveness can manifest.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead them to a new innovation process to serve the clients' needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must create a culture of innovation along with shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the Continuum procedure as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. For this reason, it reduces the area of research and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between cerebral pathology and behavior is supported by scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The advancement of new technologies allows us to see and investigate the structure and processes of the brain like never before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to construct simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Even though AI has a strong science fiction implication, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, which deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and making diagrams, the ability to answer diagnoses and customer questions, as well as recognizing handwritten letters, voices, and faces.
Such things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Nowadays, the AI system is frequently used in the fields of economy, medicine, engineering, and military service, and various home computers and video game software applications have also been constructed.
Excursions are a big part of any local lesson. Frequently, a teacher wants to take their students to places where a trip by bus is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual excursions. The students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, every year they remodel the website, but keep old versions online to serve as an album.
"Blogs" can also help improve the student's writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with grammar and spelling as they are, the presence of an audience generally changes this.
Since students often are the most critical audience, the blog writer is beginning to make efforts to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Besides this, “blogging” is “forcing students to have more knowledge of the world around them.” The need to feed the interest of the audience inspires the students to be knowledgeable and interesting (Toto, 2004).
"Blogging" is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively reacting to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings and also delineate their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and offers a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further to the south is Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more make Ontario stand out as, what people from abroad consider, typically Canadian.
The larger areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited.
For a surprising population comparison: There are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than the other islands, and it is a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxurious "beach resorts."
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, and it took a strong hold in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, at the time when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama found the Cape Route to India.
In the north, the region has Sabel as a border and in the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advisable for all women who are travelers to say they are married, regardless of their current marital status.
Also useful for wearing a suit (but that does not look too expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can result in what they may consider harassment and it is not uncommon that this includes following you, hugging you, etc.
Be firm in rejecting the men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, this does not make it okay!).
The Berber fishermen founded the modern city of Casablanca in the 10th century PEK, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenidans used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan reconstructed the city as Daru l-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the less interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as "tajine", ceramics, leather goods, "hookah" and a whole range of "geegaw", but all are for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo located on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which covered most of the city's buildings, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any trip outside Goma must be investigated to understand the security situation in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo with some of the cheapest paths to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use the boda boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short distance.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desertification.
She was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates's special program Wonders of the African World on PBS.
The city is in notable contrast compared to the rest of the cities of the country, as it has a more Arab style than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the Mozambique border in the east, the northern border of Zimbabwe, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered to be the most important park among the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Just like all the National Parks in South Africa, there is a daily conservation fee and entrance fee for the park.
It can also be beneficial to purchase a "Wild Card", which provides access to either a selection of parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks of South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The array of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a brilliant bar chart that becomes evident with the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the opposite direction of the Kowloon shore.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely populated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place where the British colonizers took as their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The "Sundarbans" is the largest coastal mangrove forest belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
Declared the Sundarbans a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the jungles are not only mangrove swamps — they contain some of the last remnants of the mighty forests that once covered the "Gangetic" area.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered in water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a sanctuary for wild animals, and it is estimated that currently there are 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although the majority, especially those going in the direction of east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06.30 and 07.30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts have the service of small buses from Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil with Saint-Georges de l’Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters high. Its construction was completed in August 2011, and it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when it is expected that the Brazilian customs control posts will have been completed.
The Guaraní tribe was the most significant indigenous group that lived in what is now the eastern part of Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced self-sufficient agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, they survived by hunting, gathering food, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, which was previously called “The Giant Province of the Western Indies,” was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and groups of indigenous natives.
The Spaniards initiated a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve many aspects of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Can also watch smaller tournaments and these matches at other times of the year.
For news about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check with the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) which has a fixed value equivalent to the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange currency at the only bank on the islands that is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the islands outside the center, they likely won't accept credit cards; however, they might accept British and American currency. Check in advance with the establishment owner which forms of payment they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical area; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are normal.
Winter can be disappointingly cold: temperatures exceptionally drop below zero, but the wind combined with humidity makes you feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no particular "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Despite that many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the animals, however, are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the regulations of the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
Regardless of how tame they might seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they do not keep an appropriate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Additionally, be aware that smell attracts bears and other wild animals, so avoid cooking foods with strong odors and keep a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Founded Apia in the year 1850 and it has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, America, and England refused to leave the harbor.
He sank all the ships, except for one British cruiser. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the death of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is divided into two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
Beaches on the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south area.
Almost all beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most of them have shaded areas provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, which is in the luxurious suburban area of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are beaches for families that are often crowded, with a wide variety of food stands along the beach. It is safe for swimming.
The main local beer is ‘Number One’, it is not a complex beer, but enjoyable and refreshing. The other local beer is called “Manta”.
There are many French wines, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia will be better for the trip.
The tap water is perfect for drinking, but bottled water is easier to find if you feel afraid.
For Australians, the concept of a coffee with milk ‘flat white’ is foreign. A black coffee ‘short black’ is an ‘espresso’, cappuccino comes with a tall glass filled with cream (no foam), and they even serve it without milk.
Hot chocolate is at Belgian standard. Fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Many excursions to the reef take place during the year, and the lessons offered for any of these on the reef are very few.
However, take advice from authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Bioluminescent waves are present near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. Occasionally, they can be present outside of these seasons.
There are friendly tribes, however, very few times they attack people. Most of the tribes are afraid of people and they will flee.
Normally, saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Advance reservations relieve the traveler of the worry of having a place to sleep once they reach their destination.
Travel agencies frequently have arrangements with specific hotels; however, you can also book other forms of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combinations of flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or if you need to take care of other documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
However, any change or request must go through the travel agency first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of visitors to the music festivals choose to camp on the site, and most of the visitors consider this a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will need to arrive early to find a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages may have ended, there are other sections of the festival that will continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the sea in the Northern Baltic during winter, check the location of the cabin, as passage through ice causes terrible noise for those most troubled.
Cruise trips to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos typically make significant efforts to maximize the time and money their guests spend. Usually, there are no windows or clocks, and it can be difficult to find the exits.
They usually have food, special drinks and offer entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and keep them at the venue.
There are places that offer free alcoholic drinks. But drunkenness impairs sound judgment and every good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
All people who are going to drive vehicles at a high altitude or cross over mountain roads must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or temperatures below zero.
On roads with ice and snow, friction is low and you cannot drive the way you drive on dry asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall that it can keep you stuck for a very short time.
Visibility can also be limited by snow that falls or blows or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic almost always continues to move throughout the year without interruption.
Safaris are probably what attract the most tourism in Africa and are the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari in popular use refers to a journey on land to see the tremendous African wildlife, particularly on the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, have the tendency to get very close to cars, and the standard equipment provides a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and panthers sometimes are shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A safari walk (also called a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "on foot") that consists of walking, for a couple of hours or different days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.

In good condition, you can cover slightly greater distances than walking – but you'll only rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through various countries would mean having to apply for a visa and undergo passport control multiple times.
The Schengen area, however, functions as one country in this regard.

Current of resaca is the flow that returns from waves that have broken on the beach, often into a reef or something similar.
Due to the topology underwater, the return flow is concentrated in a couple of deeper sections, and a strong current can form there to move water deeper.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As you exit the current, swimming back is not more difficult than usual.
Before focusing on a path that you are not taking again in the current, or depending on your abilities and if they have taken note of you, you may want to wait for rescue.

Finland is an excellent destination for sailing. The "land of a thousand lakes" also consists of thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos on the coast.
You do not necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and the lakes.
