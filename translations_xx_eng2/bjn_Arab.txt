This is a good story that confirms some dinosaurs had feathers, their theory has spread widely, but fossil details are not sufficient, creating questions about their colors and three-dimensional structures.
The feathers of some types of animals are brown because the pigments are concentrated on the top or carotenoids on the bottom.
The discovery also raises concerns about the evolution of feathers in birds.
The reason why dinosaur feathers had no perfect structure, with the name rachis, but different feathers — bristles and hairy — is because research suggests that rachis evolved further into these other features.
This arrangement of the feathers indicates that it is not for flying but for regulating temperature or for display. Some researchers think that this may be the tail of a young dinosaur, which allows it to grow adult feathers and have the underlying feather pattern.
The results of the research suggest that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, it still has mature feathers and lower feather structures.
