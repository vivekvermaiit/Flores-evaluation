Ring has also settled a legal dispute with the competing security company ADT Corporation.
While an experimental vaccine seems to be capable of reducing Ebola mortality, there are currently no drugs that have been proven to be clearly suitable for treating existing infections.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially proved to be promising, but formal studies showed that it offered fewer benefits in terms of preventing deaths than hoped.
In the PALM study, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that the scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatments with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts it as an absolute necessity that the Olympic family advocates for a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes, clubs, and their sport are better served by driving meaningful changes within our organization, rather than pursuing decertification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could reveal how abuse on the scale so bravely described by the survivors of Larry Nassar could have remained undetected for so long, and welcomes any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal - to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for the athletes, so they can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and self-determined environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on the upper side and light or carotenoid-colored on the underside.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but do have other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used not for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suspected that the specimen, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the plumage of an adult and not chick down.
A car bomb detonated yesterday morning at the police headquarters in the Turkish city of Gaziantep, killing two police officers and injuring over twenty other people.

They have discovered that the Sun operates according to the same fundamental principles as other stars: It was found that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
To determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow, the luminosity and rotation are jointly considered.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of reversals of the magnetic field.

The work was mostly theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth and causes the tides, the Milky Way also exerts gravitational forces on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter is located in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.

The extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said the new variant is "extremely worrisome and alarming due to its very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the pathogen in the hospital, says Dr. Moll, and at least two were medical hospital staff.
Within one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
Nevertheless, the proportion of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis is apparently still low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people who are infected in South Africa at any given time.

The government has also promised several million vials of vaccine against encephalitis, which will help to prepare the health authorities for the next year.
Plans for vaccines that were supposed to be delivered to the historically most affected areas this year were delayed due to a lack of funds and lower priority compared to other diseases.

Infrared images show temperature differences between night and day, which indicate that these are likely caves.
"They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night."
"Their thermal behavior is not as consistent as that of large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but it aligns with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: Voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet of paper with the name of their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials have confirmed the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law sets the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can confirm that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the election and that no envelopes are inserted except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
The candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Her first was the slalom, in which she received a "Did Not Finish" in her first run. 36 of the 116 participants achieved the same result in this race.
Her other race, the giant slalom, she finished in 10th place in the women's group with a combined runtime of 4:41.30. She was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Lösch and 1:09.02 minutes faster than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who came in ninth.
Four skiers in the adaptive skiing category did not finish, and 45 of the 117 skiers in total in the giant slalom failed to place in the race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and secured her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police president Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained significant head injuries.
The road on which the accident had occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
As a result, he was transferred to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was meanwhile charged with the murder of her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in pre-trial detention until charges are filed and the trial takes place, but statements from eyewitnesses could be distorted because her picture has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of photos potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish photos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is leading in the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians demand a resetting of the borders to the state before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other topics that are allegedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority, on the other hand, wants to accept such a presence only for five years.
The shooters of the accompanying attempt to contain the plague should be closely supervised by rangers, as the attempt was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Executive Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP within four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The trigger for the partly violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating with defective iPods have been reported. As a result, six fires were caused and four people suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that it had been informed by Apple of over 34 more incidents of overheating, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of the report by Apple "truly regrettable."
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management of the Northern Marianas said that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were rescued and there are so far at least six confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the seat of an elderly lady when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began his work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature labor in his free time.
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Wrestling colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels made the following comment: "Luna was just as crazy as I am ... maybe even crazier ... I love her and will miss her ... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the federal elections in 2010, the proportion of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The temporarily acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that in her opinion, Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of respondents share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of respondents stated that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medalist at the Olympic Games was supposed to swim in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle events and in three relay disciplines at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his many complaints, his fitness was doubted.
He was not able to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain because they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of Earth's water supply, along with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
Since comets collided with the Earth a long time ago, scientists hope to gain insights into how planets, particularly Earth, are formed.
Cuomo (53) took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
It is speculated that he might run for the office of president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year while reducing carbon emissions.
It relies on satellite-based technology instead of the older ground radar-based technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport services will be arranged, and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley. There are no parking spaces or park-and-ride facilities available on site.
With the concern about a lack of transportation options, the likelihood increased that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species developed within only two generations, although it had previously been assumed that this process would take much longer due to the mating between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into a variety of forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be manufactured very thin and adhered to other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures, called illuminated manuscripts, in books that are referred to as illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet in almost every house, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Even in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were toilets. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses that men and women visited in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then almost immediately reflects it back down.
The satellite was transported into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts our light and our view.
A gigantic rocket with a height of more than 100 feet is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest service the wheel has provided us is much simpler and faster transportation.
It brought us the railway, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized animals, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are still many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that each cat has, ensuring that it does not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called prides.
The packs consist of one to three related adult males as well as up to thirty females and young individuals.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and are just as deadly towards their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the full-throated roar of the lion, but rather like a series of growling, bellowing words.
Ocelots eat small animals. When they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are significantly smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate prey using their sense of smell. They sniff where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and move unnoticed. Ocelots hunt their prey by visually blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
If a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (e.g., if they move over a mountain range or a river, or if they relocate to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations look so different that they can no longer be classified as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply refers to the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen that humans inhale, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food through the sun via photosynthesis. Additionally, they provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothing from plants. We mainly feed on plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, in addition to another set on the palate, which meant there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but he might have had a forked tongue. He fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and might even have been a cannibal.
He attacked everything that came into the water; even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex was no match for him.
While most of their food might be familiar to us, the Romans did have their share of peculiar or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that the poor people and the women ate their meals sitting on chairs. In contrast, the wealthy men preferred to hold joint banquets, where they reclined on their sides while consuming their meals.
Dishes of ancient Rome could not contain foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn nor tomatoes nor potatoes nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
One offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to comply with the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were constructed as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses did not have such great significance.
The majority of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
The women cooked in the yard. Businesses simply consisted of shop counters open to the street. Stone was used for house construction.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Old Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder. When he traveled further west, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" were written. The text is located upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (which measures 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage at the beginning of its life.
It is therefore possible that the note was simply added as a label.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
He was controlled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the conquerors instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
After only two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation troops had liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is an independent culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state and also somehow defines the size of a society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and appropriate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical records and fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states initially formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, which consisted only of Congress.
The Congress was not authorized to levy taxes, and since there was neither a national executive nor a national judiciary, it relied on the authorities of the states to enforce all its laws, who often did not cooperate.
He also had no authority to suspend tax laws and duties between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, together with the German national football team, the second most successful in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motorsports.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians participate in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands, Japan is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago."
English sentence: Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century when European sailors passed by and documented the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a settlement in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a change in the indigenous cereal cultivation methods and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following their defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the government of the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better impression of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most widely used still image format worldwide is 35 mm, which corresponds to the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being manufactured today, but more importantly, its image format has been adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strictly speaking, the so-called 35 mm format confusingly measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or a very similar aspect ratio.
The much-maligned and often mocked Rule of Thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a level of order in an image.
It states that the intersection point of the lines that divide an image into vertical and horizontal thirds is the most effective place for the main subject (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was put to the test.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the European states together despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence ruled everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the important Christian beliefs states that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the churches exist for exactly this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was being upheld.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective as it cut the country off from vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated widely recognized international law that had been codified through several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, which posed a danger even to neutral ships.
Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a position with the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the USA with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his superior at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique method of indicating different ages. Each era in China and each family that was in power was its own dynasty.
Unstable times of divided provinces also prevailed between the individual dynasties. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, bitter wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
The same applies to the military, because instead of being based on class affiliation, the army rankings were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed people of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond this everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Nur" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has endured through time and offers a vivid picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you are inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
One sees nothing except the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Cheops Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures that were constructed to venerate deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis," in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, as well as the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upstroke" symbol looks like a V and the "downstroke" symbol like a bracket or a square missing the bottom line.
Upwards means that you should start at the tip and push the bow. Downwards means that you should start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Usually, the upstroke generates a softer sound, while the downstroke is stronger and more expressive.
You are welcome to add your own pencil markings; however, remember that the printed bow markings are there for musical reasons, which is why they should usually be respected.
The panicked King Louis XIV, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie-Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who were making threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At some point, a member of the enraged crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles before the eyes of the horrified queen.
The war expenditures of the US imperialists for the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the majority of expenses, and the interest from bonds flowed through the Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the ongoing exploitation of the Filipino people represented the fundamental gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that spans the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally agreed to end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. On the one hand, that the development of technology follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are more inherent than socially conditioned.
One could argue, for example, that passenger cars inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
The Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, drawing from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged in relation to this geography, and since they were in harmony with the place of society, they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of today's world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
His status declined over the course of the twelfth century, primarily due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of fashion capital of the world also shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th-11th and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the East.
However, the styles in the West lag behind by 25 to 30 years due to slow communication channels.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe slowly began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic method of cultivation that uses saved seeds native to the ecoregion and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can distinguish themselves from others in terms of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical in nature, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits, and jargon.
One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children were kept captive by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the inability of the parents to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wolf children may have experienced severe child abuse or undergone traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
If it was completely raised by animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within the scope of its physical capabilities) that are almost entirely in accordance with those of its specific caregiver animal, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning is intended to make the learning process simpler and more interesting, "scaffolding" takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an aid that supports individuals in a novel learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the little paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest, and explain work steps that the student may not be able to manage alone.
Children are placed in foster families for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to extortion.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving, and education-oriented, but many are forced to do so.
For us, the care placement system is a piece of security for these children.
Our foster family system is intended to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The foster home should meet all the needs that they were not receiving in the home from which they were previously removed.
The internet connects both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the internet have led to additional dimensions regarding the utility and reward approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "enduring relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights for the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression.
In his article, "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks demonstrated how people who, due to brain damage, can no longer understand language can still accurately assess the honesty of individuals.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may possibly be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation causes new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation between the two pools back and forth with each generation.
Outside in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant sources.
Moreover, it has severe consequences if neglected: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide large amounts of protein that contain all essential amino acids.
Overall, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how the chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional waking during normal sleep periods and falling asleep a short time (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you are someone who resets the alarm clock in their sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, which are known for their diuretic effects) before going to bed so that you are forced to get up to urinate.
The level of inner calm a person possesses inversely correlates with the level of tension in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing vitality is. Every person has the potential to find absolute calm and contentment.
Anyone can attain enlightenment. The only things standing in the way of this goal are our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded by the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation lies deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are opened, and enlightened consciousness arises.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war ended, the clash of systems, history, and culture led to the countries becoming enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and, in reality, be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already completely collapsed, and the only hope lay in a retreat and a regrouping along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became almost obsolete overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and established them, after having violated the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties by invading the eastern regions of Poland.
The use of ships for freight transport is by far the most efficient method for transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional role of the navy was to ensure that a country remains able to transport people and goods, while simultaneously hindering the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in the Second World War. The Americans tried to transport personnel and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
Had the Allies failed, Germany probably could have conquered Great Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran approximately 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them as livestock to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed on hills or other grazing areas. The goats were looked after by goatherds, much like the more well-known shepherds; these were often children or adolescents. These grazing practices are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, rail tracks were built in England.
Although the transport tracks merely consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to achieve higher speeds and pull larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of that time.
Quite early on, sleepers were introduced to secure the position of the rails. Gradually, however, the realization prevailed that rails carrying a band of iron are more efficient.
This became common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of locomotion was walking. Human beings began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as regularly.
Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little.
This is often just like a symptomatic treatment. However, if you want more than temporary solutions, then we should find and treat the root of the problem.
It is really obvious that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological advancements of mankind and that the problems caused by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people have become more severe.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are known today as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript did not endure the times.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and still live today. We call them birds.
Many do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like those of a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the processing of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or as bits, to use computer jargon.
An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indicator of poisoning by ingestion may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is derived from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adaptable in parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most widespread neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can assume parenthood.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works using the scientific method. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific investigations.
However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by asking questions and conducting observations.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were recognized.
With the loss of Greek language knowledge, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often fundamentally based on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Behavior determined by a cycle, which are not only reactions to signals from external cycles, are known in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that can perform free-running cycles for a while even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a wide range of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the cells concerned are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the wild plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns by car to drive to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic commuter traffic, everyone is in some way connected to and supports a transportation system that is based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has disrupted the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems lead to such grievances, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave somewhat consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain constancy and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of facilities on the roadway.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them evade predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them a wider selection of small shelters where they can hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold back their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the sun was at the center of the motions of the solar system.
Some people thought that he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the Earth.
That seems reasonable, as it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river in the world, at times up to six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows through the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It absorbs water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to humans since ancient times, as they can all be found in their original form in nature and can be extracted with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
This corresponded more to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, he also put forward the theory that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also other metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe in its entirety is made up of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them would fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Accordingly, after its invention, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background with the advent of newer writing methods, so it has been relegated in its status and usage.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to go near a pencil sharpener.
One can be curious about what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When the core splits again, part of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they can decay with little or no provocation.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is referred to as the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the mare and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there could be more maria, as the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Substantive theories focus on finding what motivates or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
These theories deal with what makes certain people want exactly the things they do, and which influences in their environment lead them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or one of the gals).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team did and makes everything their own.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are managed by the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet across different time zones that local management may not take into account.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the leadership team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization undertake the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One objective for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the collaborative work of an organization in overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative method to address customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must develop a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the exploration of cognition. Thus, they narrow down the field of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, such as traumas, injuries, and tumors, affect behavior and lead to changes in some brain functions.
Emerging technologies enable us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
AI is indeed strongly associated with science fiction, but it is an important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include management, developing strategies and schedules, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has also been integrated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every class. It is not uncommon for a teacher to want to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Virtual excursions represent a technical solution. Students can view museum pieces, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artworks from the classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often have sloppy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blogging experience, this usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to learn more about the world around them." The need to capture the audience's interest inspires students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' texts and present their own perspectives on certain topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, distinguished by a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north, the untouched beauty of nature extends in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more characterize Ontario as what is considered typically Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further to the north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans in the USA than Canada has citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, as far as wildlife is concerned, its own continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belong to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and it was very successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel zone, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider an assault, and that it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be consistent when rejecting men, and do not hesitate to defend your point of view (cultural differences or not; that does not mean it's okay!).
The present-day Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was used as a strategic port named Anfa by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Marinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida, and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes, and a whole range of trinkets, but that's all just for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any stay outside of Goma should be carefully planned to understand the status of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Nyiragongo Volcano and for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
This, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has turned "Timbuktu" into a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Although Timbuktu is considered a tourist attraction and has an airport, it is nowadays an impoverished city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the most important stops of Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World."
The city stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has more of an Arab than an African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
He is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily conservation and entrance fees.
It may also be worthwhile to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is the center of attention for many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline have been compared to a dazzling bar chart, which becomes visible through the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and go to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists appropriated. If you are looking for traces of the area's colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove belt in the world, stretching over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within Indian territory is referred to as the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which one third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses depart all day from the inter-district bus station (across the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since the buses between the districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses that are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis offer a quick and convenient way to reach nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 meters high, its length is 378 meters, and it has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017. It is anticipated that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will then be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group that inhabited present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the Great Province of the West Indies, emerged in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous native groups.
The Spaniards began the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be watched here at other times of the year.
You can find information about competitions and sales outlets for polo match tickets at the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is pegged to the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and at Stanley credit cards. US dollars are also frequently accepted.
On the remote islands, credit cards are likely not accepted, although British and US currency may be accepted; check in advance with the owners which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. Temperatures above +30 °C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and moisture make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons: The amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the sight of people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authority's instructions, visitors should stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful bison, elk, moose, bears, and virtually all large animals may seem, it can still happen that they go on the attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them enough space.
Also, be aware that scents can attract bears and other wildlife. Therefore, avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented foods and keep a clean camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1750s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of an inglorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except for a British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence campaign organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the town led to the killing of the high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Since Auckland stretches over two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) lie on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming opportunities, and most offer shade provided by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a beautiful shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The most important local beer is "Number One." It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be more digestible.
You can safely drink the local tap water, but if you have concerns, you can easily find bottled water as well.
For Australians, the concept of a "Flat White" coffee is foreign. A small black coffee is an "Espresso", Cappuccino is filled high with cream (not with froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are indeed expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of the authorities, heed all signs, and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear close to the shore and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They may occasionally occur outside this period as well.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea; their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the assurance that they have a place to stay upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies often have arrangements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other types of accommodations, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, transport to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should first be directed to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festival-goers decide to camp on site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to go early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that music will still be played in parts of the festival late into the night, even after the music on the main stages has stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
When crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as icebreaking can cause quite terrifying noise for those most affected.
The cruises to Saint Petersburg also offer time for a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos generally strive to keep guests on-site as long as possible and encourage them to spend a lot of money. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can sometimes be difficult to find.
They usually have a special offer on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests entertained and ensure they stay.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players understand the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who wants to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should expect snow, ice, and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, traction is low and one cannot drive as if on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
The visibility can also be impaired by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to a journey across land to observe the impressive African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and the standard equipment provides a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are often shy, and you can observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") consists of a hike that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having already been the host city in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for the year 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus did not apply until July 2020, for which the Olympic Games were planned.
It is assumed that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with an average ticket costing approximately ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels lend out irons and ironing boards, even if you are not present in the room.
If no iron is available or you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful that the material does not get too hot (this can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, lead to burns).
There are various methods for purifying water. Some of them prove to be more effective in counteracting certain dangers.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, while in others, it needs to be several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritations, or, in the worst case, even trigger allergic reactions, administer poison, or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans with violence are usually not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from duties and excise taxes at certain locations.
Travelers whose destination country has high taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is probably the greatest driving challenge, as it often passes through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay alert: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are prevalent here.
The specified speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than usual.
Interestingly, however, the mobile coverage here is much better than in many other parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite tasty. In Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, just like those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are widespread, with apples being baked into pastries year-round and cherries and plums being used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also include almonds, hazelnuts, or other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich pastries, then try what is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is typically used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is typically used.
With an assortment of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if the term is used without further attributes, it usually refers to food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simply seasoned dishes. As flavor enhancers, the Javanese prefer peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut blossom sugar), and a range of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are aids for the rider's feet, hanging down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet might get caught in them.
English sentence: If a rider falls off the horse and gets caught with their foot in the stirrup, they can be dragged along if the horse bolts. To minimize this risk as much as possible, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First and foremost, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Moreover, some saddles, particularly English saddles, are equipped with safety stirrups that allow a stirrup leather to fall from the saddle as soon as it is pulled backward by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes along the walls, which provide endless possibilities.
Sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular activities where you attach skis or a snowboard to your feet and ride down a slope over a snow-covered surface.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally also known as "ski bums," who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The origins of downhill skiing as a sport date back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Backcountry skiing with a backpack: This activity is also called ski touring or backcountry skiing.
It resembles alpine ski touring or mountaineering, but does not necessarily include them, as the latter are carried out in steep terrain and require much sturdier skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
Under good conditions, you are able to cover somewhat greater distances than when hiking – only very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing on groomed trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has numerous independent countries. Normally, one would have to apply for multiple visas and go through several passport controls if one wants to travel through multiple countries.
However, the Schengen Area functions somewhat like a country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
Accordingly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member countries individually, which saves time, money, and bureaucracy.
There is no universally valid definition of which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition shows geographical variations, where the age limit in areas like North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handcrafted products could be described as "antique" even though they are younger than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding represents an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also significant for many who work in other professions.
Even in the past, not all Sámi bred reindeer on a large scale; instead, they lived from fishing, hunting, and similar activities. They kept reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Even though the term "gypsy" is mainly used by non-Roma, it is often perceived as offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma.
If a travel advisory is issued for the country you will be visiting, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also consult the advice of governments other than your own. However, their guidance is tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Consultations are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Severe weather is the collective term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption, or loss of life.
Storms can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal storm phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to watch out for any kind of severe weather affecting their area, as this can impact all travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country considered a war zone should undergo professional training for it.
An internet search for "course on hostile environments" will probably show the address of a local company.
A course usually covers all the problems discussed here in much more detail, typically in combination with practical experience.
A course usually lasts between 2 and 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are numerous books and journals about surviving in the wilderness, but only a few publications about war zones.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they carry valid identification documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with unspecified gender (X) or documents that have been updated to the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents also varies greatly.
The searches at security checkpoints have also become far more intrusive in the period after September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals before their surgery should not expect their privacy and dignity to remain intact when passing through the scanners.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves broken on the shore, often around reefs or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper areas, and a rapid current to deep water can form there.
Most fatalities occur due to exhaustion when attempting to swim back against the current, which can prove to be impossible.
When you get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to get somewhere where you won't be caught again. Alternatively, depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their original culture.
When you come home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to another culture and abandoned some behaviors of your home culture.
When you traveled abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers need to adapt in a new country.
One might not expect that patience and understanding are also required towards returning travelers.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it is quiet before the show begins.
Usually, you constantly hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The story of the sounds and the light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as a background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, with the different pyramids being illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. In 2020, sixteen were active.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula transition here into the plateau and then rise again to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at an elevation of 4,892 meters.
In remote areas without cell coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, as you must be outside and in clear line of sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure ships, as well as by expeditions that require data and voice remote connections.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year off is study and course offerings abroad.
This is particularly popular among school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before university without affecting their studies.
In many cases, participating in a gap year program abroad can actually improve your chances of getting a higher education in your home country.
As a rule, a tuition fee is charged for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a great travel destination for boat tours. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands – in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
For the archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland; every sixth or eighth person owns a boat.
This is indeed comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty).
Most pure Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several whole days while returning in the evenings and staying overnight on the ship.
If you only go ashore during shore excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin in Germany as a destination in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and from all walks of life, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: It is nothing other than the personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
Learning more about how airplanes work and the procedures during a flight can help some people overcome the fear associated with the unknown or the feeling of having no control.
Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of items. Often, time is a very important factor for business documents, commercial goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own aircraft, but on other routes and with smaller companies, difficulties arose.
If they shipped things via air freight, unloading and customs clearance on some routes could take several days.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious method to fly in First or Business Class is to shell out a hefty sum of money for the privilege (or, even better, to get your company to cover the costs).
However, it is not cheap: As a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
In general, it is pointless to even look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The native language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, the economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova could be restored.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
The former ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, progressive, and bustling commercial center located on a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are characterized by classic red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city exudes more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves over some graves.
It's worth strolling for half an hour through the fascinating village.
In the north and in the immediate vicinity lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron described its splendor in vivid colors.
The Scotturb bus 403 regularly travels via Cabo da Roca to Sintra.
Also visit in the north the great Shrine of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima (pilgrimage site) – a place that is world-famous for its Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site as well as a place that holds almost immeasurable significance for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more with relatives who were murdered or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with the dignity, reverence, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by applying or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
Most of the signs, however, are only in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Normal announcements are made in the metro exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Even though this is often just an inaccurate cliché, one finds their way best in Paris by presenting their best side and behaving like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will significantly ease getting along.
The brusque exterior of Parisians disappears very quickly when you display basic manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and it offers a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to its numerous microclimates, various soils, and alternating altitudes, it boasts a remarkably large variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animal and bird species.
There, you can find rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wildcats, and capercaillies, as well as many more commonly occurring species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach below the knees and also cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries, there are wrap skirts available for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Analogously, men must wear trousers that reach over the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothing is not washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable in these skirts. For all men, there is one size fits all!
The Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar regions of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and always uses olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available ingredients like cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, except the word "Sie" for "you," always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to differentiate between some verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier, but writing is somewhat difficult because you have to determine whether a verb or an adjective is being used as a noun.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively easy because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g because their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also be careful to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means "dear", whereas carro means "chariot".
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
That's why reading this introductory grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand expressions.
If you speak a Romance language, it is naturally easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak some Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is so similar that it does not need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually no longer in operation today and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not the problem during its peak that it is today, they are usually located in cities or on university campuses, which are easier to access than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms, known as Hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other nobility members in the vicinity of the imperial court.
"Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even 'just one' specimen."
If you visit a formally designed garden and collect "samples", you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place where you can easily find your way around and buy almost anything upon arrival.
Since you are in the extreme tropics and only a few degrees north of the equator, you must expect both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also a few buses that travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for vacation planning.
For example, castle tours in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube, or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also represent popular hiking and cycling routes.
In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important holidays and is considered the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the festival have been adopted worldwide by non-believers in both Christian and non-Christian countries.
There is a tradition of spending the night before Easter awake in some open spot to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also quite possibly be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with community celebrations often beginning at midnight, where the resurrection of Christ is celebrated.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or washing ashore.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the first humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be accustomed to.
Suits are considered standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their surnames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with the focus being more on group performance than on praise for individual achievements.
Often, employees must obtain the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to follow their bosses' instructions unconditionally.
