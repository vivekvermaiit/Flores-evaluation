That only reinforces that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, while providing details that are generally not found in their fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.

The reason dinosaur feathers do not have a good central shaft called a rachis is because they have other feather functions, such as display and researchers conclude that the rachis is an evolution from other feather functions.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they could not be used for flight, except for helping with temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggest that, although this is a young dinosaur specimen, it shows adult feathers and not chick down.

Currently, there are not many vehicles available and the subway will not stop at Wembley, and car parking facilities and playgrounds are not available on the grounds.
Efforts are made due to the limited remaining transportation, perhaps how to feel in the middle of the room without an audience supporting the team.
The research published on Thursday in the Scientific Journal reported a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Scientists from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report the existence of a new species that evolved in two generations, whereas this process is believed to take a long time, as seen in the evolution of Darwin’s endemic finches, Geospiza fortes, and immigrant cactus finches, Geospiza conitostris.
The gold was worked into many shapes. This resulted in pieces as small as grains of rice.
That is if fibers can become threads, they can be spun and woven. They can be beaten or flattened until they become paper.
The gold here can be used for ornamentations with great elegance and is also attached to different kinds of metals. These are often used as decorations for handwritten paintings in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
That is the name of a chemical substance. It is used to make a reactor with red cabbage juice.
This cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of its chemical compounds.
The pH level indicates the concentration of hydrogen ions (H in pH) from the chemical substance being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).

The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in each house, connected with a sewage system that was sophisticated.
The blood drainage system was mostly found in the houses from the Minoan city on Crete and Santorini in Egypt.
It also became a toilet from ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, a shared toilet was simply a place in public baths where men and women gathered together.
At the time when he called his friend who was far away, he used a satellite.
A satellite in outer space receives a call and then sends it back to Earth at high speed.
The satellite is sent into outer space using a rocket. Scientists use a telescope in outer space because Earth's atmosphere refracts various light and views.
That uses a rocket with a length of 100 feet to launch satellites or telescopes into space.
The wheel has transformed the world from the paths of the past. Nowadays, the large wheel has become the essential means of transportation, being cheap and fast.
The wheel has been present in carts, cars, and other forms of transportation.
Below the grassland, there are many medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized animals such as rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
At the end, there are many small cats (including those that are kept as pets) that hunt various small creatures such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The cat's space should be a specific concept, a special creation designed for every cat so that the cat doesn't feel restricted.
A lion is a type of cat that is very social, living in large groups called prides.
The pride consists of one to three adult male lions along with up to thirty lionesses and their cubs.
Girls usually have close relationships, becoming an extended family with their female relatives and niece.
The pride of a lion does not behave like a pack of wolves or dogs; a prey sees the lion as a lion in its demeanor, and also very deadly in approaching its prey.
A form of an athlete who has remarkable intelligence, able to catch (although not always perfectly), agile, skilled at long distances and equipped with the strength of five human limbs.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four types of cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as loud as the fierce roar of a lion, but rather resembles the gentle whisper of harsh words.
An ocelot likes to eat small prey. It will hunt monkeys, snakes, turtles, and birds when it can. All prey is generally much smaller than itself.
The scientists discovered that ocelots stalk and catch prey through trails marked with scents, tracking where they are on the ground.
He is able to see very well at night using night vision, and also moves stealthily. The ocelot approaches its prey by creeping on the ground before pouncing on it.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) separates from the main population of their origin (such as when they move to the mountains or rivers, or when they move to a new island where they have no competitors), they will adapt to their new environment, which is different from their previous location.
This new environment has diverse resources and varied competitors, causing the new population to develop different characteristics or adaptations to better compete with what was previously available.
The original population was not changed even a little, they still carry the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, it starts threatening to differ from other populations.
Finally, after nine or ten million years, the two populations will look very different as they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the creation of a new species. Speciation is a consequence that cannot be avoided and is a part of what happens in evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that is breathed by humans, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that is expelled by humans (exhaled breath).
Plants produce their food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also create oxygen.
We build our houses with insects and make clothes from insects. Many of the foods we eat are from insects. Without insects, animals would not survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator in its time, so it feared nothing, except for another mosasaurus.
The shark, which has more than 70 knife-like teeth, along with an additional set of teeth embedded in the roof of its mouth, means that nothing can escape once it passes through its path.
We don't know for sure, but maybe it had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might have been cannibalistic.
They also investigate whatever enters the water; it is thought that even a big dinosaur like T. rex cannot surpass it.
The food they often eat is common to us, but the Romans really have food that is rare or uncommon, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of dormouse.
The separate dining was intended for those who have passed away and also for the wives who sit in their husband's place at the table, while the men prefer to eat together elsewhere if they have a common lounge next door when they eat.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not be included in the category of cuisines that came to Europe from America or from Asia in the later centuries.
For example, he doesn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or chocolate, and no Romans eat turkey.
The people of Babylonia built a magnificent temple for their gods which is referred to as the house of the god.
The people will offer offerings to the gods, then the priest will pray to fulfill the desires of the gods using offerings and a festival.
Every temple has an outer courtyard that is spacious and then a sacred place in the middle where only priests can enter.
The special tower here is a pyramid-shaped structure, known as a ziggurat, constructed as part of the temple.
The top of the tower is a sacred place of the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the houses are very spacious.
Many Jewish family lives took place in crowded places.
The women gathered in the front-yard; the storage was just a shop facing the road. Stones were used to build the house.

Greenland was first inhabited. In the Norse Sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for killing a person, and when traveling west, he found Greenland and named the place Greenland.
However, without discussing their findings, the Eskimo community has already settled there in that area.
Although each country is 'Scandinavia', there are many differences regarding people, kings, costumes, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you ever watch the movie National Treasure, you can learn about a treasure map inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is simply not appropriate. Although there is something written in the margins of the document, it is not just a treasure map.
Written in the corner of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The note is visible at the bottom of the document, upside down.
It is not certain who wrote it, but it is believed to have been noted at the beginning of its age, as most of the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up when stored.
Therefore, it seems that the focus is simply like a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed had secured the northern area of France, but not yet the south.
This was ordered by "Vichy" France. It refers to the French people who had collaborated with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the occupiers without any shame.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked Southern France, an attack known as "Operation Dragon".
In the second month of the week, the American and Free French forces liberated Southern France and pushed towards Germany.
Civilization is a culture that is carried out by a large group of people who live and work together, a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," meaning civil, related to the Latin word "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and this also emphasizes the importance of the community.
City-states are the origins of civilization. Civilized culture is expressed through knowledge that is passed down through many generations, the cultural traces that remain, and equitable dissemination.
The culture of young generations must not lose historical evidence that should be used and preserved as a proper civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states initially formed a central government which was guided by Congress as its component under the Articles of Confederation.
The congress lacks influence due to imposing taxes, and, because there is no national executive or judicial, this is based on state authority, which often does not wish to cooperate, by enforcing all its laws.
Moreover, this does not have the authority for legal enforcement and tax rates in the country.
This article requires the unanimous consent of all countries before any amendments and considers it neglectful if a country's representative does not attend.
The national football team of Italy, along with the national football team of Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the North, with Italians competing in international games and the Olympic events.
Japan consists of approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is called Honshu), making Japan the seventh-largest island country in the world.
Because Japan is an island cluster, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago geographically.
Taiwan was discovered in the 15th century by European sailors who crossed the seas and recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In the year 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the production practices of the native grains and employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644 - 1912) forced control over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and established Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In the year 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which required them to cede sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until the year 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the coast of the complex have been rebuilt to offer tourists a better impression of their existence.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the image photography format that is most common worldwide is 35 millimeter, which has a dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
This is still produced today, but what is more important is the aspect ratio that is inherited by the format of the digital camera image sensor.
The 35mm format is actually, although a little confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm tall.
The aspect ratio of this format (listed as twelve to obtain the most simplified integer ratio) is thus referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (APS family for example) are similar to or approach this aspect ratio.
The third principle of the third which is often misused and mocked is a simple guideline that creates dynamism and maintains the cleansing measurements by its image.
This explains that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was gaining attention.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united European countries despite differences in languages and customs.
The power that rules over all humans, from kings to common people.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial assets should ultimately follow this path.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for more than nine hundred years, and this concentration of power and wealth has made many people feel that these principles have been compromised.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain implemented a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy has already proven its effectiveness, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violates international laws that have been widely accepted and codified over the past two centuries.
England mined international rivers to prevent axes from entering all seas there, causing danger even to neutral ships.
Due to the limited response with this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar response from its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the attitudes prevalent among many of the country's citizens and nations were expressed through pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horror and brutality of World War 1, countries will avoid such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with only four cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of indicating different periods of time; each part of China and the ruling family is a distinctive dynasty.
Every dynasty is an era that is unstable due to divided provinces. The most notable epochs from these periods are the three Epochs that took place over 60 years during the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During this period, fierce battles took place among many nobles who fought to gain the throne.
These three kingdoms are among the most bloodthirsty in ancient Chinese history. Many people died as a result of vying for the highest position at the Grand Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state has a figure who becomes the sole ruler.
After the open revolutionary process, all the male applicants who demonstrated the most ambitious and successful potential succeeded.
Yes, which equally applies to the military because instead of ranking troops based on class, they are now based on Cildaber.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed workers in other countries to pursue their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very pleased with the experiences in this worldly life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
He replaced his body, which was safe at that time, providing the clearest image of Muhammad's spiritual tendency.
Marriage occurs at the top of one of the Mountains to the north of Mecca, which is extremely isolated from the outside world.
Certainly. Here's the translated sentence: Nevertheless, it's impossible to find them if they know their own existence. Upon entering the cave, it is total isolation.
There is nothing that can be seen beyond the clear and good sky above and many mountains surrounding. Only a small part of this world can be seen or heard from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Constructed by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the great pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to house the deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the valley of Ancient Egypt, consists of several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The symbol "upward direction" looks like 'V' and the symbol "downward direction" looks like a box that has four downward-facing sides.
When going up, it means you should aim from the top and tip of your bow, and when going down, it means you should aim from the bottom (where your fingers hold the bow) and hold the bow.
A relaxed bow usually produces a gentle sound, but a tense bow produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Do not hesitate to take a pencil to mark the diagram, but remember that the marked symbols printed there are generally subject to removal for specific reasons, so they should typically be erasable.
The fearful King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4), along with the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a group of women at the market.
In the car, he/she returned to Paris accompanied by those who shout and wave flags to the King and Queen.
The group of people insisted that the King and Queen open the balcony window.
During the war, King Agamemnon took one of the priest Apollo's daughters who caused a plague in the Trojan army.
The money used to finance imperialism in the struggle of the Philippines is taken from the suffering of the Filipino people.
He was forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime intended to finance expenses and bond interest incurred in the name of the Philippine government using Wall Street Banking Houses.
Ensure that the superprofits obtained from the unending exploitation of Filipinos do not become the fundamental benefit of American imperialism.
In order to know 'templar', one must understand the context that leads to the existence of ritual.
The term is generally referred to as the Middle Ages in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000 - 1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended with the convention in 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses various perspectives in practice, ranging from technological impulse or technology creation to the understanding that people are merely guided by subconscious choices linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
There are many interpretations of technological determinism that broadly fall into two categories: the view that technological development is the primary driver that dictates the path forward, leaving little room for cultural or political intervention, and the view that technology has "effects" on the society it interacts with, compared to society that is conditioned by social factors.
For example, the increasing number of cars and motorcycles results in growing traffic on highways.
However, the national road network did not quite keep up with the growing economy and the increasing number of vehicles, necessitating new production methods to reduce car manufacturing costs.
Mass car accidents have also led to an increase in road incidents, which have resulted in the discovery of new techniques in healthcare through the repair of damaged bodies.
Romanticism has a major influential element on culture, drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, Schlegel.
In the context of romance, people who are imagined through geography, and who occupy time customs and cultures that have connections with that geography arise, and this is the same with the place of community, better depicted through boundaries that are enforced and moved.
Because Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Recognized as a center of happiness starting around 400 AD and continuing until around 1100 AD.
The status still persisted until the end of the twelfth century where the Crusaders had already departed carrying gifts such as silk and spices which were more valuable than anything known in the Byzantine market.
In that era, the transfer of the title Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris took place.
The gothic style peaked during the period of the 10th to 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Previously, the accomplishments were influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, although the channels of communication are separated, the styles in the West have persisted for 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe witnessed a development of its style. One of the most significant developments was a result of the Crusades using buttons to fasten garments or clothing.
Subsistence farming is farming that is carried out to produce food that meets the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a system that is currently organic, using seeds that are native to the 'ecoregion' combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques in order to achieve maximum yields.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming and this is still carried out in developing countries.
A subculture allows individuals with similar interests to feel not constrained by social standards and encourages them to develop a sense of identity.
Subculture is influenced by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of its members.
The quality that determines subculture can arise from linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of the subculture identify their membership using distinctive and symbolic styles, which include fashion, behavior, and jargon.
One of the most commonly used methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to consider various cases of underprivileged children, unheard children, suffering, or those who experience intentional abuse, which are not socialized by the youth and elders when they are grown up.
Little ones like these are referred to as "feral" or wild. Many feral children have been confined by people (usually their elders); in many cases, these children were unheard of due to the elders' neglect in severe intellectual or physical impairments of the child.
Feral children might have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or losing themselves.
Apart from that, it is said that its identity has been exaggerated by the fugitive; there are complaints of life in the wild.
If they are cornered by humans, these feral kittens behave like wild animals that are afraid of or indifferent to humans.
However, foundational learning through projects should make learning exciting and enjoyable, which can enable children to learn a lot.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method but rather support that provides assistance to individuals who are in the process of acquiring new learning experiences, such as using a new computer program or tackling a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual and real, in other words, teachers act as such scaffolds like small paperclips found in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software and aims to ask, request, and convey procedures that are supposed to give challenges to students to develop their skills.
Children are placed in orphanages due to various reasons such as neglect, abuse, and other issues including exploitation.
There is no child who deserves to grow up in an environment that does not listen, care for, and educate them, but they experience it.
I am aware of a system to ensure a safe place for the children.
All children deserve a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and accessible healthcare.
The orphanage should provide all the necessary needs that cannot be fulfilled at home before the children are taken.
The internet connects elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The development of the internet symbolically opens up an additional dimension in the context of utilitarian approaches and gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are understood as motivational factors for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal utility" and "facilitating relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined the audience behavior from websites.
The use of video recording has resulted in important findings in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements carried out in a matter of milliseconds.
Specifically, it is said that they can find out if someone is lying by interpreting subtle micro-expressions accurately.
Oliver Sacks in his essay titled The President's Speech, demonstrated how people who do not understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
They are very capable of suggesting that such ability in interpreting human behavior can be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Variation of shuffling that separates and recombines back and forth between two ponds in each generation.
Out in the Savannah, despite having primates with digestive systems similar to humans, they fulfill their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Beyond that, failure to implement it properly can have serious consequences: Stunted Growth, Malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible factory resources are converted into preferred protein from leaves and legumes, but this is very difficult for primates like us to digest outside of their ingestion.
On the contrary, the food from the hunt (ants, grasshoppers, eggs) is not easily digested, but it provides a high quantity of protein containing all essential amino acids.
All creatures that are compared, humans cannot ignore if the elders bring up the "protein issue" using the same way as chimpanzees that inhabit the savanna until now.
Sleep disturbances are a waking process that occurs intentionally during a normal sleep period and in the deepest adult sleep (10 - 60 minutes).
This can be done by using an alarm clock that is relatively gentle so as to allow the person to wake up without shocking them.
If you find it necessary to reset your alarm clock, place it on the far side of your room, and you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Different biorhythm choices involve consuming a lot of fluids (especially water or known diuretics such as tea) before sleep, forcing the child to wake up.
The presence of inner peace acquired by him has an inverse correlation with the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force that exists. Everyone has the potential to find peace and true satisfaction.
Each individual is trying to seek enlightenment. Obstacles in achieving this goal are tension and negativity within the mind and body.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it is influenced by the love of Mahayana and uses many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In the fundamental principles of Tibetan Buddhism, this is mainly about Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the cultivation of love.
Together with Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini Energy (Enlightenment Energy) is formed using yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The place for Tibetan meditation is the divine yoga. Using visualization with the deity, the blocked energy channels, chakras are activated, and the enlightenment consciousness is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. The end of the war, system changes, processes, and culture caused the collapse of nations.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies had now become enemies, and the Cold War broke out.

On 17 September 1939, the defense of Poland had already collapsed, and the only hope was to reorganize along the Romanian border.
However, this plan was considered outdated and reckless when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union, the Red Army, entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after attacking the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga peace agreement, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is still the most efficient way to move large amounts of cargo and people across the sea.
The traditional functions of a navy include ensuring a nation's security by protecting its people and goods, and additionally, securing against enemies by controlling people and goods.
One example of a new tactic that can be cited with this idea is the Atlantic Campaign during WWII. America attempted to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the height of its power, the German navy, mainly using U-shaped boats, attempted to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies fail to act, Germany might gain control over England as it dominates within Europe.

Although the railway is only equipped with wooden planks arranged in a row, it allows the train to run at high speed and to pass large objects on roads that are slightly rough in that part.
Rail cushions were initially known to hold the track in place. However, recently, it has been discovered that it is more efficient if made of iron on the surface.
This can often be done, but the iron that grinds the wooden wheels of the carriage quickly wears out.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, all tracks made of iron were introduced.
The first transportation known was walking, humans began walking about two million years ago with the existence of Homo Erectus (which means standing human).

We have the right to start a sustainable life on Earth, we have the right to join the environmental movement, and we have the right to become active in reducing future challenges until what has been planned is accomplished.
This is like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not want to offer temporary solutions, then we must find the root of the problem, and we must solve that problem.
The earth's surface has experienced many changes due to the scientific and technological advancements of humans, and the main problem is due to an excessively high population as well as a joyous human lifestyle.
After being accepted by Congress on July 4, the draft signed by the Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent in several handwritten copies to the print shop of John Dunlap.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, which are now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".

All people are together in the community and use the transportation system. Some people complain about the transportation system.
In developed countries, people often hear complaints regarding water quality or damaged bridges.
How does improving the transportation system address complaints like this, and how does it affect daily life? Is it because the transportation engineers are incapable? Or are there fundamental issues at play?
Traffic flow is a study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, learning about the flow of traffic is difficult because the actions of drivers cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave consistently in medium-sized areas; Because of this, traffic flow is logically consistent and can be approximately represented mathematically.
Balinese sentence: Mantuka ring ngewakilin aliran lalu lintase, hubungan sampun katerapang ring embang tiga ceciren sane utama: (1) aliran, (2) kepadatan, miwah (3) kecepatan). English sentence: When representing traffic flow, the relationship is identified in three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship is helpful in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects are the first animals taken to the sky. Their ability to fly helps them evade predators and acquire food and mates more efficiently.
Too many insects have a surprise due to folding their wings back towards their bodies.

Two content theories that are well-known are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, the two performers were stressed when the manager started to lead those who were initially under him. At first glance, the spectrum seemed to try to remain "part of the man’s group" (or wife).
The manager category has the responsibility of making few decisions, enforcing disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and asking individuals to be accountable.
At the edge of a different spectrum, someone turns into a person who is unrecognized, who should change the pattern that has been established by the team and understand it as their own.
How are you, the leader at the end has responsibility for the team's success or failure.
This implementation produced many conflicts among the leaders and other team members.
The virtual team follows excellence standards like the conventional team, but there are subtle differences.
Angga's virtual team is very useful as a direct physical group contact point.
They are granted more autonomy compared to conventional teams because the team agreed to meet according to predetermined zones preferred by local management.
The presence of a "real team that is not led" (Larson and La Fasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component for virtual teams.
The team that is not visible is the management team where each member reports. The team that is not visible enforces standards upon each individual member.
What causes organizations always cross the path that leads to establishing a learning organization? One goal is by introducing the concept of organizational learning towards the practical reality of innovation.
