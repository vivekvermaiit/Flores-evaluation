This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a known theory, but also provides details that fossils often cannot offer, such as those related to colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut-brown on the top, with a pale or yellow-orange-red underside.
The discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but have other feather characteristics - barbs and tiny barbules - researchers have concluded that the rachis is likely part of a later evolutionary development in relation to other features.
The structure of these feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for temperature regulation or appearance. Researchers state that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows feathers of an adult, not a young individual.
Research has shown that even though this is a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen displays adult feathers rather than chick feathers.
A car bomb that was detonated yesterday at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.

They discovered that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars. It has been determined that the activity of all stars in the system is guided by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is associated with plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is considering the magnetic field inversions.

The completed work was mainly theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter is located around the galaxy in a sort of halo, and consists of a multitude of small particles.

Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that these are deep cavities in the ground," said Glen Cushing, a member of the Astrogeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Voting in France is conducted without technology. Voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet of paper, on which they mark the candidate they are voting for, into an envelope.

Candidates may send representatives to monitor every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

In addition to the event held on Wednesday, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the championships.
Her first race was the slalom, where she did not finish in the first race. The same result in that race was recorded by 36 out of 116 competitors.
In her second race, the giant slalom, she placed tenth in the women's group with a combined race time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished in ninth place.
Four female skiers in the women's Paralympic category did not manage to finish the run, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not manage to finish the race.
Police from the Madhya Pradesh region have found and returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya stated: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and we have found and returned her mobile phone and laptop to her."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially placed in the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since appeared before the sheriff court in Edinburgh, charged with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any witness evidence may be dismissed because her picture has been published many times.
That is a regular practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish judiciary functions differently and the courts have considered that releasing photographs may be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee points out that "it seems that journalists are really walking a fine line if they publish photos of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is fully responsible for criminal prosecution, indicated to the journalists that no additional comments will be made, at least until the indictment is filed.
The document, according to leaked information, will pertain to the dispute over borders that Palestine wants to base on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in this valley for a period of ten years after the agreement is signed, while PA accepts military presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary trial program for pest control needed to be under the close supervision of the rangers, as the trial program was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited in accordance with the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters' Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director for conservation and heritage of the park within the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received detailed safety instructions and training.
Yesterday, in the new Temporary Electoral Council (CEP), nine members were sworn in before Martelly.
That is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission suggested that the former CEO resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
At times, violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod overheating have been reported, which caused a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported having information on 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple informed them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company states "are not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in reporting "truly unfortunate."
The earthquake struck Marijana at 07:19 in the morning local time (Friday at 09:19 PM GMT).
The Office of Emergency Management of the Northern Mariana Islands announced that no damage has been reported in the country.
Moreover, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there are no indicators of a tsunami.
A former police officer from the Philippines held tourists from Hong Kong hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued so far, and at least six have been confirmed dead.
Earlier, six hostages were released, including children, the elderly, and photographers from the Philippines.
The photographers later took the place of the older lady when she needed the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins began a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While he was working at Liggins Hospital, he researched premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that hormone intake will accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs.
The Xinhua agency reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" for recording data during the flight on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated that "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of a blue moon. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was as strange as I am...maybe even more...I love her and will miss her...I hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the federal elections in 2010, the number of those opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
As part of the campaign for the 2010 federal elections, the interim government Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed she believes that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
This opinion is shared by 34 percent of respondents who hope that Queen Elizabeth II will be the last monarch in Australia.
The survey revealed two types of extreme views: 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle events, as well as in three stages at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness is in doubt due to complaints.
He could not take the medication necessary for pain relief because those drugs are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery by the beginning of February using different hardware and software, which was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source for delivering water to Earth, along with organic matter that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, aged 53, became governor earlier this year and last month he signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors political chatter and nonsense.
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that NextGen is a system that would enable aircraft to fly shorter routes, thereby saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and simultaneously reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of outdated ground radar-based technology, so that air traffic controllers can locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be provided and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and park and ride facilities are not available near the stadium.
The fear of a lack of transport has increased the likelihood that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science claimed the formation of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have announced that a new species developed in just two generations, although it was believed that this process took much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made in various shapes. It can be twisted into small forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used for decorating hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
It is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemicals are.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders, then with clean, wet hands, form a ball from them.
Moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, leading to a strange feeling and creating a kind of protection.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flushing toilet that was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the homes of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Bathrooms existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, bathrooms were sometimes parts of public baths where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and then reflects it back down, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists in space use telescopes because Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and view.
To place a satellite or telescope in space, a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel has provided us is much easier and faster transportation.
He brought us a train, a car, and many other transportation devices.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging in size from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including lost pet cats) that eat much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a special skill that each cat possesses, which is why they do not compete with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats and live in large groups called prides.
The pack consists of one to three adult males who are related and up to thirty females and younglings.
Women are usually closely connected to each other because it is a large family of sisters and daughters.
Packs of lions operate similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals whose behavior is surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not other big cats), and also very deadly to their prey.
A tiger, like a true decathlete, can climb (although not well), swim, jump large distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) with lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four cats that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of angrily shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate the animals they feed on (prey) based on scent by sniffing the ground where those animals were present.
They see very well in the dark due to their night vision, and they move very quietly. Ocelots hunt prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on the prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originate (for example, during crossing over a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island, making it difficult to return), they will often find themselves in an environment that differs from the one they were previously in.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population, in order to be a strong competitor, will need different characteristics or adaptations compared to what was needed before.
The initial population has not changed at all, they still need adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to the new environment, it starts to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will differ so much that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in, and they take in the carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants produce food through photosynthesis using the sun. They also provide shade.
We build houses and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time. It feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws contained more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional row on the roof of the mouth, meaning there was no escape for any creature that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but maybe it had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe it was even a cannibal.
He attacked anything that entered the water. Even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for him.
While most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans also ate some strange or unusual food at banquets, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that, while poor men and women ate sitting on chairs, wealthy men liked to host banquets together where they would recline on their sides while eating.
Old Roman dishes could not include food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their deities, which was considered the home of that deity.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could access.
Sometimes special tower structures in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower represented a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not that important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; the shops were just open cash registers facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was incredibly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it that name.
However, regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there during that period.
Although each country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might think there is a map to a treasure written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" are written. The text is inverted at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that this great document on parchment (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was initially rolled up and placed in an archive.
So, it is possible that the note was added simply as a label.
The Normandy landings (D-Day) and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
The north of France was ruled by the French "Vichyists." These were the French who in 1940 made peace with the Germans and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting against them.
The Allies attacked southern France on August 15, 1940, and the attack was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization originates from the Latin word civilis, which means civil and relates to the Latin word civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state and which in some way defines the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. Civilizational culture entails the transmission of knowledge through several generations, a long-lasting cultural footprint, and fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
According to the Articles of Confederation, during the War of Independence, the thirteen federal states first formed a weak central government, whose only component was Congress.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive authority or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, which often did not cooperate, to enforce acts.
He also did not have the authority to nullify tax laws and tariffs between states.
The members required full consent of all states before any changes could be made, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and they were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective.
The origin of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan in 1624, initiated a change in indigenous grain production practices, and employed Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
In Machu Picchu, there are three main structures - the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been restored so tourists can get a better insight into how they originally looked.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and restoration has continued to this day.
For example, the most common static image format in the world is 35 mm, which dominated at the end of the analog film period.
It is still produced today, but even more important is that the display format has been adopted in the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually somewhat confusing - 36 mm in width with 24 mm in height.
Therefore, the scale proportion of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of the whole number) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format family) are equal to or approximate this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often misused and often mocked, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in the image.
It is stated that the most effective position for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
In that period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, found itself under control.
The Christian religion united European countries for over a thousand years despite different languages and customs.
Her dominant power influenced everyone - from the king to the common man.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the financial resources of the church serve precisely this purpose.
The central organ of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and because of this concentration of power and money, many wonder whether this rule is being followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of the conflict, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in disrupting the delivery of vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated internationally accepted law codified in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering parts of the ocean, causing danger even to ships from neutral countries.
Considering the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted warfare beneath the sea.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes among most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and crimes of war during the First World War, the countries wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States because he accepted a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) for Thomas Edison.
Old China had a unique way of depicting different historical periods. Each phase in China's history or each family in power was recognized as a distinct dynasty.
Additionally, the period between each dynasty represented a time of divided provinces. The most famous such period was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those periods, fierce wars were waged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for the highest position in the great palace in Xi’an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the occupations of the revolution were opened to all male applicants, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military, because instead of ranking military ranks based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in topics beyond this earthly life. He often spent time in a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) and contemplated.
The cave itself, which has survived all times, provides a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if someone knows it exists. Once you enter the cave, it is complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky and numerous mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, which the Egyptians built in the third century BC, is one of the many large pyramidal structures constructed in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
On the Giza Plateau or the "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, there is a series of pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The marking "bow up" looks like a V, and "bow down" is like a bracket or a square missing its bottom side.
"Up means you need to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you need to start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow."
Bow up usually creates a softer sound, while bow down is stronger and more declarative.
Feel free to write your markings in pencil, but remember that the printed bow markings are provided for musical purposes, so they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
In the carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who were screaming and shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to have the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a mafia member waved the head of the royal guard member killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The costs of war from American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a large portion of the costs and interest on the bonds that were initiated in the name of the Government of the Philippines through banks on Wall Street.
Of course, the super profits stemming from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic profit of U.S. imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that prompted the founding of the order.
The period in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the medieval period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is conventionally agreed to have ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice implies a wide range of ideas, from technological drive or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by the fundamental logic associated with the laws of science and their representation in technology.
Two general ideas are common to most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond the influence of culture or politics, and that technology in turn has "impacts" on societies that are intrinsic rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that motor vehicles necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, the network of roads throughout the country is not economically sustainable for just a few cars, which is why new methods of production have been developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a greater number of accidents on the roads, which leads to the discovery of new techniques in healthcare for repairing injured bodies.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism, adopted from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture associated with those geographical areas emerged, and they were, in harmony with the society's place, better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury was established around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
His status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than anything the Byzantine market offered.
At that time, the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
The style of clothing in the beginning was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Western Europe towards the end of the Middle Ages began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of that time as a result of the Crusades is when people began using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture aimed at producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seeds from a specific eco-region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence farming, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together people with the same worldviews who feel that social standards neglect them and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be identifiable by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
Qualities that make a subculture different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often demonstrate their affiliation through a specific and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behavior, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is pointing to several unfortunate cases of children who were not provided socialization by adults during their development due to neglect, accidents, or intentional abuse.
Such children are called "feral" children. Some feral children were kept in captivity (usually by their parents); in some cases, the children were abandoned because their parents rejected their severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Rejected children may have experienced violence or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
It is believed that the others were raised by animals. Some are believed to have lived independently in the wild.
After being entirely raised by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behavior (within physical limitations) that completely resembles the behavior of the animal that took care of him, such as fear and indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning simpler and more interesting, the "scaffolding" method goes a step further.
"Scaffolding" is not a method of learning, but a means of assistance that provides support to individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Help can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is one form of help but also the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into software and are intended for testing, guiding, and explaining procedures that might be challenging for a student to conduct independently.
Children enter the foster care system for various reasons ranging from neglect, abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where care, affection, and education are not expressed, but it happens.
We believe that the Foster Care system represents a safe zone for these children.
Our foster system needs to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should meet all the needs that were unmet in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
Different characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of access to benefits and satisfaction of needs.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered important motives for using the Internet (James et al. 1995).
"When they researched audience reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified 'personal involvement' and 'ongoing connections' as new aspects of motivation."
The use of video has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that through correct interpretation of microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks indicated in his work, The President's Speech, that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still correctly assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior may be present in animals like domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century pointed to the fact that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix variations between those two bases in each generation.
For a primate with a digestive system like humans, it can be difficult to satisfy amino acid needs from available plant resources in the savanna.
Moreover, if it is not done that way, it leads to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and pods, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
Unlike them, animal-origin food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but it also provides a huge amount of proteins containing essential amino acids.
When all is taken into account, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees do today in the savannas.
Interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally waking up during the normal sleep period and going back to sleep a bit later (10-60 minutes).
That can easily be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock in your sleep again, you can leave it on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm involve consuming a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, which is a known diuretic) before sleeping, which will force the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in the body and spirit of the person.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force will be. Every person has the potential to find their absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only things that stand in the way of this goal are our own tensions and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it is expanded with the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of complete love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, conflicts between systems, processes, and cultures led to disagreements between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies have now become enemies, and the Cold War has begun.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be conducted indirectly, through proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17th September 1939, the defense of Poland had already been crushed and the only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became practically obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of the eastern parts of Poland, thereby violating the Peace Agreement of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for the transportation of goods is by far the most efficient way of transferring large quantities of goods and a large number of people across the ocean.
The traditional task of the navy is to ensure that the country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously disrupting the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this practice is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans attempted to transfer soldiers and materials across the Atlantic Ocean in order to provide assistance to Britain.
At the same time, the German navy mainly tried to stop this trade using U-boats.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain the way it conquered the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were domesticated for the first time almost 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were most often kept in herds that roamed hills or other grazing areas, and they were often tended by goatherds, mainly children or adolescents, similar to today's shepherds. These livestock raising methods are still used today.
The wagons were being produced in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach greater speeds and carry more loads than was the case on the somewhat rougher roads of that era.
Railway sleepers were introduced quite early for fixing the rails. However, it was gradually realized that the rails would be much more efficient if they had a metal strip on top.
It became a common practice, but the iron caused greater wear on the wooden wagon wheels.
The wooden wheels were eventually replaced with iron wheels. The first full iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known means of transport was walking, people began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations have been observed in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, though there is a possibility that Sahelanthropus was walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental protection movement, and we can even become activists to reduce suffering in the future to some extent.
This resembles symptomatic treatment in many cases. But if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problem and eliminate it.
It is clear that the world has changed considerably due to the scientific and technological advancement of humanity and that problems have become greater because of overpopulation and people's extravagant lifestyle.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the nearby printing house of John Dunlap.
Between 150 and 200 copies, known today as the Dunlap broadsides, were made during the night.
The first public reading of that document was held by John Nixon on July 8, in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
25 Dunlap posters known to exist are the oldest surviving examples of that document. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and exists today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many things about birds that still make them resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with chandeliers and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their back two legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two possible values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms like vomiting are rather general for a diagnosis to be immediately established.
The best indicator of poisoning is the presence of an open box of medications or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in a formal context for this group of insects.
This expression derives from a long-standing familiarity with bedbugs, insects that are highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and common bed bugs are crimson, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 confirmed cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among younger adults and middle-aged individuals.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
The couple might decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to raise the baby.
These couples can make a decision to create a plan for adopting a baby.
In the adoption process, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to determine how the world works using the scientific method. In fact, most scientific research is conducted using this method.
However, it is not only experimentation, as an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, but also asking questions and making observations that lead to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of the Greeks diminished, the West became cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which do not merely represent responses to external periodic stimuli, have been recorded in a large number of living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to run even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the leading assumptions that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or labeled the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the specific part of genetic material, and whether germ cells are affected.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photographing, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
Example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small towns on the outskirts by car and head to their workplaces, passing by those who work in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected and supportive, a transport system based on private cars.
Science now shows that this high carbon-emission economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or crumbling bridges.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
The study of traffic flow is the examination of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with complete certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave quite consistently. Therefore, traffic flow has a kind of reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To improve the representation of traffic flow, connections have been established between three basic characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily avoid predators and to search for food and mates more effectively.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along their bodies.
It provides them with a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings backward are dragonflies and mayflies.
More than a thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but the majority believed the opposite claim - that the Solar System, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
It sounds reasonable because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and at the same time the largest river on Earth. It has more than eight times the water volume compared to the second largest river.
Amazon is simultaneously the widest river on Earth, at some places it is up to six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river, the Amazon, is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from a thousand smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of their size and technical perfection of construction.
The New Kingdom of the ancient Egyptians admired the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were more than a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian language for legislation and official communication.
Italian is simultaneously the everyday language spoken by the majority of employees in that country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of Vatican City are of Roman Catholic faith.
Since ancient times, people have been aware of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper because they can all be found in nature in their original form and can be relatively easily exploited using primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that everything is made from a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also had a theory that they change into new substances and form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain non-metallic elements, such as carbon, in small quantities.
All things in the universe are made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many after it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the development of newer ways of writing, the pencil has fallen to a lower status and is used less frequently.
People now write messages on computers and never need to get a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer appears.
A fission bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with a multitude of protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing a heavy cart uphill. The fission of the nucleus releases part of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they have a tendency to decay with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
Thinner under the seas, and thicker under the mountains.
On the near side, there might be more maria because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what drives people's behavior or attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have developed during maturation into adulthood.
These theories observe what it is that drives some people to want what they do and what in their environment will compel them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of satisfaction are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can emerge when managers start leading their former peers. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulties in making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, evaluating staff, assigning tasks, and demanding accountability from employees.
On the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, it is the leader who ultimately bears responsibility for both the team's success and failure.
Such behavior often results in disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, yet there are small differences.
Members of the virtual team often function as a contact point for their physical groups.
They often have more autonomy than other team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
A unique component of a virtual team is the presence of the true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
"The 'Invisible Team' is a management team to which each member is responsible. This team sets standards for every member."
Why would an organization want to go through a time-consuming process to establish a learning organization? One goal of implementing the concepts of organizational learning in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are efficiently utilized in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity may emerge.
As a result, the process of organizing where collaboration aims to overcome obstacles can lead to a new innovative process to meet clients' needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must establish a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the approach to the continuum as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of operation.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, they narrow the scope of the research and make it much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and brain tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advancement of new technologies allows us to observe and explore brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It gives us a large amount of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction context, it represents an extremely significant branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, and scheduling, the ability to provide responses to client diagnoses and inquiries, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice, and faces.
Such matters have become separate disciplines focused on providing solutions to everyday problems.
The artificial intelligence system is often used today in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and it is also integrated into several applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of every class. The teacher would often like to take her students to places where traveling by bus is not an option.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual trips. Students can view artifacts in museums, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
The virtual trip is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future students.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. This website changes every year, but the old versions are retained online and serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Considering that students are often the audience with the most criticism, the blog writer starts striving to improve his writing to avoid criticisms.
Also, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to enhance the interests of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing blogs is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend the learning process beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can encourage students to start thinking more analytically and critically. By actively responding to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of what others write and can express their own opinion on certain issues (Oravec, 2002)."
The city of Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital of Canada, home to numerous art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Niagara Falls is located further south, while in the north lies the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and other areas.
All of this and much more highlights Ontario as what outsiders consider quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas further to the north are quite sparsely populated, and some represent almost uninhabited wilderness.
Here’s a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the USA than Canadian citizens.
East African islands are in the Indian Ocean along the right coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and represents a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
The majority of smaller islands are independent countries or are associated with France and are known as luxury resorts with beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to those countries, which particularly took hold in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area to the north is surrounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It can also help if you wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to something they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow them, grab their hand, etc.
Be resolute in rejecting men and do not be afraid to stand your ground (regardless of cultural differences, it is not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by a fisherman from the Berber tribe in the 10th century BCE, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake that occurred in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badža, and the name Casablanca was given by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old city of Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of geomags, but this is all made for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, at the easternmost part of the country, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the ongoing fighting situation in North Kivu province.
This city is also the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo with one of the cheapest climbs to see Mountain Gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The standard (local) price for a short ride is approximately 500 Congolese francs.
Due to the fact that it is quite inaccessible, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for an exotic, distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although it is a tourist attraction because of its reputation and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat from desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during PBS's special program Wonders of the African World hosted by Henry Louis Gates.
This city is completely different from other cities in the country because it has more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River forming its southern boundary.
The park spans 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading South African national park (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It can be useful to buy a Wild Card that allows entry into some parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gave the territory of Hong Kong its name and represents a place that many tourists consider the main point of visit.
A parade of buildings forming the skyline of Hong Kong is connected with a shimmering graphic visible thanks to the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon Bay on the other side.
Most of the urban part of Hong Kong Island is densely situated on cleared land along the northern shore.
This is the place that British colonizers took for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, you can start at this place.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just salt marshes - they include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which almost one-third is covered by water/swamp areas.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is believed that about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and nearly 30,000 spotted deer live in this area today.
Buses depart from the bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxi rides are a quick and easy way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River, connecting the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyjapock in French Guiana.
Two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous community that lived in the area of present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurúa and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering fruits, and fishing.
Paraguay, whose earlier name was "The Giant Province of India," was established in the 16th century after encounters between Spanish conquerors and indigenous native groups.
The Spaniards began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the largest annual tournament is held at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Here, at any other time of the year, small tournaments and matches can be watched.
For news about tournaments and locations where you can buy tickets for polo matches, check with the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one British pound (GBP).
On the islands, money can be exchanged at the only bank located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands, and in the city of Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, although it is possible that British currency and the currency of the United States may be accepted; check in advance with the owners what the acceptable method of payment is.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside of the islands, so exchange the money before you leave them.
Considering that Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer there occurs when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical climate; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to encounters with people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park owners require that you stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
Despite appearing to be docile animals, bison, elk, moose, bears, and nearly all large animals can attack.
Every year dozens of visitors get injured because they do not maintain an appropriate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous. So give them space.
Moreover, do not forget that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant food products and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has fewer than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious maritime standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town ended with the murder of the supreme leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches as Auckland borders two harbors. The most famous beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches on the north shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy where it is safe to swim, and a large number receive shade from pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the suburbs of the upper part of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
Those are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good range of shops stretching along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number 1", and it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that can be drunk, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better for travel.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you're worried, you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is "espresso," cappuccino is topped with a lot of cream (not foam), and tea is drunk without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but they are excellent.
Throughout the year, tours to the reef are organized, and injuries on the reef are rare.
However, listen to the advice given by the authorities, respect all signs, and pay special attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April, north of the town of 1770. From time to time, they can also be spotted outside this period.
Sharks exist, however they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live permanently in the ocean. Their primary habitat is the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance provides the traveler with peace of mind because they know they will have accommodation upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with certain hotels, although you may see that it is possible to book other types of accommodation through the agency, such as campsites.
Tourist agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to/from the airport, or even a combination of flights and hotel accommodation.
They can hold your reservation if you want to think about the offer or obtain other documents needed for travel to that destination (e.g., a visa).
All changes or requests should first be directed to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
When it comes to some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on-site, and most attendees consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to arrive early to secure a camping spot near the music.
Remember that although the musical content on the main stages is finished, music might be played late into the night in some parts of the festival.
At some festivals, there are special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the position of your cabin as passing through the ice causes a terrible noise for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the money and time guests spend. There are typically no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They mainly have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and retain them on the premises.
In some places, alcoholic drinks are served on the house. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all experienced gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and it is not possible to drive as on clear asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall very quickly for you to get stuck.
Visibility can be limited by falling snow or blizzard or condensation or ice forming on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal occurrences in many countries, and traffic generally continues without disruptions throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the best tourist experience in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular use refers to a journey over land to see the stunning African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and the standard equipment will enable you to have a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better if you look through binoculars.
Safari walk (also known as "bush walk," "safari hiking," or "trekking") consists of walking for several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some sporting events will also take place at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics as it was already the host in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, you might find yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March, most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus are not being extended until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Most tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with the price of standard tickets being around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can speed up their drying. In many hotels, it is possible to borrow an iron and an ironing board, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if it is available to you.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are different methods for purifying water, and some are more effective depending on specific threats.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil the water for one minute, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters differ in efficiency, and if you are concerned, consider buying bottled water from a reputable manufacturer.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they have not seen in their regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, an allergic reaction, spread poison, or transmit infectious diseases.
Only infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill humans are usually not classified as pests.
Shopping in duty-free stores is an opportunity to purchase products that are exempt from taxes and excises at certain locations.
Passengers traveling to countries with high tax rates can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, as the road often runs through isolated forest areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay calm: the road is dominated by steep terrain, narrow lanes, and sharp bends.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on the preceding and following sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence is even more important than usual.
It is interesting that the mobile reception here is much stronger than in many other sections of the route, e.g., in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite rich and diverse, similar to those made by their southern neighbors, the Austrians.
Fruit pastries are common - apples are cooked in pastry throughout the year, and cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often make a good combination with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but rich pastry, try the pastry, which, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries. Coconut milk is frequently used in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines present throughout the nation.
However, if used without additional qualifiers, the term usually refers to food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now available across the archipelago, features a range of simply spiced dishes. The dominant flavors enjoyed by the Javanese are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are support for the rider's feet hanging on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, but they can create safety issues because the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and their foot remains in the stirrup, the horse could drag them if it starts to run away. To minimize risk, many safety measures can be taken as a precaution.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a flat, fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the leather stirrup leathers to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls them during a fall.
In the Cochamó Valley - a top climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, there are various granite big walls and cracks.
The ascents include breathtaking views from the peaks. Climbers from all parts of the world constantly find new routes through its endless potential of walls.
Snow sports that involve descending slopes, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that entail descending snow-covered terrain on skis or a board attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main travel activity for many enthusiasts, occasionally also known as "skiing fanatics," who plan entire vacations in terms of skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, but usually does not include them, with the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a trail similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover greater distances than by walking, but you will rarely achieve cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack and on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean having to go through the visa process and passport control multiple times.
However, in that regard, the Schengen area acts as one country.
As long as you are in this zone, you can cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each Schengen member country, saving time, money, and reducing paperwork.
There is no universal definition that determines which items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographic variations, where the age limit might be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products could be defined as antiques, even though they are newer compared to similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important means of livelihood for the Sami, and the culture around trade is also important for many with other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and raised reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Today, many members of the Sámi people engage in modern commerce. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the region where the Sámi live.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani populations, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma.
If the country you are planning to visit becomes subject to a travel advisory, it may affect your travel insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You can also consult the advice of governments that are not your own, but their advice is intended for their own citizens.
One example is the fact that American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice represents only a summary of the political situation in a particular country.
The expressed views are often brief, general, and simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world. Disasters can be of various types, which may depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Storms, hail, excessive precipitation, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, downpours, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of any risks posed by severe weather affecting their area, as adverse weather conditions can impact travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that may be considered a war zone should have professional training.
By searching the Internet for "Hostile Environment Course" you will likely find the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, often with practical experience.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and involves role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but there are few publications that cover the topic of war zones.
Passengers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documents for their return journey.
There is an inconsistent willingness among governments to issue passports that do not specify gender (X) or documents that are updated to match the desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to act in accordance with these documents also varies greatly.
Searches at checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the period after September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to pass through the scanner and retain their privacy and dignity.
Return currents are the backward flows of waves that hit the shore, often a reef or something similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper parts, and there can be a rapid current towards deep water.
Most fatalities occur due to exhaustion that happens when a swimmer tries to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you break away from the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to aim somewhere you won't be caught again or, depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
The shock of re-entry often comes before cultural shock (there is less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more difficult.
Passengers who easily adapted to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to a new culture and lost some habits from your original culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
People may not expect that both patience and understanding are necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light effects of the pyramids are some of the most interesting things in the children's section.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can also see them in the silence before the show starts.
Usually, you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is set in the background and tells a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries claim the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and they have the most bases, as many as sixteen active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is situated 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with a settlement called Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is the area south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into a plateau, and then rise again into the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, cleaved by the Minnesota Glacier.
Most of the mountains in Antarctica are located in the northern part of the Sentinel Range, called the Vinson Massif, whose peak, named Mount Vinson, is 4,892 m high.
In remote areas not covered by a mobile network, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally does not serve as a replacement for a mobile phone because you need to make calls outdoors, with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
This service is often used in the transportation of cargo by ship, including recreational vessels, as well as in expeditions that require the exchange of data and voice messages over long distances.
Your local telephone service provider should provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
It is an increasingly popular option for those planning to travel and learn for a year.
This is very popular among high school graduates, as it allows them to take a gap year before enrolling in college without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can actually improve your chances of transitioning to higher education in your country.
Usually, a tuition fee is charged for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht on the archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are truly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
The activity is almost the same in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands, this number is from one to forty).
Most Baltic Sea cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days and return to the ship to sleep at night.
If during the boat trip you only go ashore, you will not need a special visa (since 2009).
Some cruises in their brochures include Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map, Berlin is not even near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
That's not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and aversions to other things that many people have.
Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during the flight can help some people overcome the fear that is based on the unknown and lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of goods. Time is often of crucial importance for business documents, goods, or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
For some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, problems have arisen.
If things are shipped by air, it may take several days for unloading and customs on some routes.
The only way to get the package through was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
An obvious way to travel first or business class is to loosen the purse strings and shell out a heap of money for that privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: you can generally expect to pay up to four times the regular economy class price for business class and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point even asking for discounts on business or first-class seats for direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
Chișinău is the capital city of Moldova. The native language is Romanian, but Russian is used in many places.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has gone through an ethnic conflict.
That conflict in 1994 resulted in the establishment of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has a government and a currency, but has not been recognized by any UN member states.
Economic ties have been established between these two parts of Moldova despite unsuccessful political negotiations.
The most widespread religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with close to 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Once it was the old city of Smyrna, and now it is a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center located around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are adorned with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although this city has more of the feel of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldarsvik, there is a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and in the village, there is an unusual octagonal church.
Above some of the graves in the churchyard, there are interesting sculptures of doves made of marble.
It was worth taking a walk through the intriguing village for half an hour.

Please treat this place with the dignity, formality, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not desecrate the place by making or carving graffiti on the buildings.
In Barcelona, Catalan and Spanish are official languages. Almost half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most of the signs are listed only in Catalan since it is by law the first official language.
However, the Spanish language is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for their reputation as egocentric, rude, and arrogant people.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with others in Paris is to behave politely, like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make navigating considerably easier.
The sudden exterior of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show basic kindness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is located in large forests, mainly beech, spruce, and fir, and boasts a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to the range of microclimates, different soils, and varying levels of altitude, there is a very wide selection of plant communities.
This area is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be found there, as well as many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts below the knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide scarves to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially those with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monks or nuns at the entrance.
In the same way, men are required to wear trousers that go below the knee.
And you can borrow this at the entrance, but this clothing is not washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these robes. One size fits all for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like the cuisines of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil for everything.

All nouns, along with the word Sie for "you," are always written with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs and objects.
It can undoubtedly facilitate reading, although writing is somewhat more complex due to the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is used in a noun form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
You need to be careful with the letters c and g because their pronunciation depends on the following vowel.

Premodern observatories are now obsolete and are maintained as museums, or places for education.
Considering that mild pollution at its peak was not the problem it is today, they are usually found in cities or campuses and it is easier to reach them than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures located in remote places with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Observing cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
That concept originated in China, where the plum blossom was the flower of choice.
The emperor organized the first cherry blossom viewing party in Japan just for himself and other members of the aristocracy gathered around the imperial court.
Plants look their best when in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally organized garden, you will also be thrown out without discussion for collecting "samples".
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay, easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
However, if you are in the "high tropics", just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to endure both the heat (always) and the intense sun (less often when the sky is clear).
Several buses go north towards Hebron, the traditional site where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are buried.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the day of Jesus's birth.
Many traditions related to holidays have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of not sleeping on Easter night and watching the sunrise in an open place.
There are, of course, also Christian theological explanations for that tradition, but it can also be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
Traditional churches hold Easter vigils on Saturday evening during Easter weekend, and the congregation members begin celebrating exactly at midnight to commemorate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to reach the island, which made the giant tortoise the main herbivore on the Galapagos.
Since man came to the Galapagos, many mammals have also arrived, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during winter, you will experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, as the sky will be dark for 24 hours.
Light pollution often does not pose a problem because the areas are sparsely populated, and you will be able to enjoy the view of the stars.
Japanese work culture is based on hierarchy and formality more than Westerners are accustomed to.
Suits are standard business attire, and employees address each other by their surnames or positions they hold.
