A little way down the road, there is a cat that is half the size of a typical one and it eats animals ranging in size from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
There are now many kittens (including the house cat) that eat small animals such as small insects and flying insects, mice and lizards, geckos, and birds.

The type of cat, the Ocelot, likes to eat small animals. They will hunt rabbits, snakes, mice, and even birds if they can. Almost all the animals killed by the ocelot are smaller in size compared to it.
The researchers believe that ocelots follow their prey by tracking their scent trails to find the places they frequent.
They are able to see very well in the dark because of the glow of the night, and move in ways that are unnoticed, too. The ocelot hunts by camouflaging itself to blend with its surroundings and stealthily approaches and captures its prey.
The time when a group of animals (a smaller portion) separates from the larger group (such as when they climb over mountain ranges or cross a river, or move to a new island and cannot easily move) they will easily find themselves in a new environment compared to where they were accustomed to before.
The situation in this new land will alter the sources of life and the conflicts found there, and it will require newcomers to adapt so they can engage in stronger disputes than those they previously desired.
The group that was separated has not changed at all, they still want the previous situation.
As time goes on, as the new group begins to move to their new locations, they start to look different from the main group they separated from.
It will come to pass, after thousands or millions of years, that the appearance of these two groups is so different that they can no longer be considered as belonging to the same kind.
These things are called speciation, which means the establishment of a new species. Speciation is something unavoidable and is a very important part of the evolution of life.

Education is often based on the practice of something that makes learning easier and more enjoyable, which is a step ahead of scaffolding.

The scaffold can be used for both online learning and face-to-face learning, or in other words, the teacher is a type of scaffold as well as the Microsoft Office paperclip assistant.

The nutrition from foods like proteins and legumes found in vegetables is difficult to obtain directly for certain animal species, including humans, and must be sourced before it can be consumed.
However, if the foods of animals (goat, rabbit, eggs) are compared, not only are they edible, but they are also rich in nutrients with all the amino acids needed.
However, if we consider, we should not be surprised by the way our ancestors used their wisdom to address what is called a "protein problem" like the monkeys in areas where they are raised in the savanna today.
