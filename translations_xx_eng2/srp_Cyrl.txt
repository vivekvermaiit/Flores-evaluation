In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, this also provides us with details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid-colored on the underside.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called rachis, but have other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – researchers concluded that the rachis probably developed later in evolutionary history compared to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but for temperature regulation and display. The researchers' stance is that, although it is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample suggests that it is the feathers of an adult specimen, not a juvenile.
Researchers stated that, although this is a juvenile dinosaur's tail, the specimen shows adult feathers rather than chick down.

The brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which relates to the flow of plasma.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of its magnetic reversal.

The work done is mostly theoretical in nature, but the program is written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
To the effect the team was searching for would lead tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
By the same principle by which the Moon pulls the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around the galaxy is located around the galaxy in the form of a halo, and it is composed of numerous tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new strain is “extremely problematic and disturbing due to the high mortality rate.”
Dr. Mol thinks that some patients may have been infected in the hospital, and at least two were hospital healthcare workers.

Candidates may send representatives to attend each part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

In her second race, the Giant Slalom, she finished in tenth place in the female seated category, with a combined race time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winner, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers in the seated category did not manage to finish their races, and 45 out of 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not manage to make it to the race ranking list.
Police in Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and returned her mobile and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Buta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chanda Shekar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when it was hit by the car, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services were freeing the driver from the red Audi TT.
In the beginning, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoja has been charged with the murder of her son at the sheriff court in Edinburgh.
He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be compromised since her picture was published in numerous media outlets.
This is common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish legal system operates differently and the courts consider publishing photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee noted, "It seems that journalists are treading a dangerous line if they publish images of suspects or anything else."
The Scottish public prosecutor's office, which is generally responsible for criminal prosecution, told reporters that there would be no further comments at least until the indictment is raised.
According to leaked information, the document will pertain to the discussion about borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-Six-Day War borders of 1967.
Other discussed topics reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian authorities agree to that presence only for five years.
The marksmen in the supplementary pest control action were supposed to be under the strict supervision of the rangers, as the action was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Thanks to the partnership between NPWS and the corporation named the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were engaged within the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting Director of Park and Heritage Protection at the NPWS agency, four marksmen selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
The new electoral commission (CEP) of nine members was sworn in yesterday under Martelly.
That is Martelli's fifth election commission in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the former resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
This commission was Martelli's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests are caused by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been due since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating defective iPod devices have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the given devices.
Last week, META announced that Apple informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "insignificant."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's report delay "truly regrettable."
An earthquake struck Marijana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM on Friday GMT).
The Office of Emergency Management in the Northern Mariana Islands said no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held tourists hostage in Hong Kong by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Ronaldo Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of the elderly lady since she needed the toilet. Mendoza was shot down by a firearm.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began to build a career in the field of medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that in the case of hormone application, fetal maturation of the baby's lungs would accelerate.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black boxes," containing flight records, on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a two-month night. Quite uniquely like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was just as weird as I am... maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the number of those opposing Australia's transition to a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of respondents share this opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
In the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold Olympic medalist was supposed to swim 100 and 200 meters freestyle in three relays at the "Commonwealth Games," but due to his complaints, there are doubts about his fitness.
He could not take the medication he needed for pain relief because they were banned at the Olympic Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several individuals confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software by the beginning of February, and it was also announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water that reached Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets have been colliding with Earth since ancient times.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, became governor earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He said the rumors were "political chatter and nonsense."
It is rumored that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will enable aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to earlier technologies based on ground radars, so that air traffic controllers can determine a more precise position of the aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate data.
No additional transport placed on overground trains will stop at Wembley, and park and ride facilities are not available above ground.
Fear of a lack of transportation has increased the likelihood that the match will have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" reports the creation of a new bird species on Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species evolved in just two generations, although it is believed that this process takes much longer, due to the mating between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into all kinds of forms. It can be rolled into fine shapes.
It can be processed into a thin wire, which can be twisted or braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made in a very thin form, as well as glued to another metal. It can be so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate pictures in books known as "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (considering that hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix those two dry powders together and then press them into a ball with clean, damp hands.
Moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a sort of sheath.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house, which were connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of the sewage system were found in the homes of Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women shared the same company together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and then sends it back down almost instantly.
The rocket sent a satellite into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and images.
Sending a satellite or a telescope into space requires a huge rocket, over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is that it has enabled us much easier and faster transportation.
That brought us the train, car, and many other means of transport.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming pet cats) that prey on much more numerous small animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of an ecological niche, a specific task each cat performs that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social among cats, and they live in large groups known as prides.
Packs consist of one to three related adult males, alongside up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions in behavior (but not to other big cats), and they are also very deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb a tree (though not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with a force five times greater than a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion, but more like a sentence full of growling, exclaimed words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and, if they can, birds. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists think that ocelots track and seek out animals they will eat (prey) through scent, by smelling the spot on the ground where they were.
They can see very well in the dark with the help of night vision and also move very silently. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with the surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originates (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need to have different characteristics or adapt to be a stronger competitor than was previously required.
The original population has not changed at all, so they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it resembles the other population less and less.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the creation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in, and take in carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide us with shade.
We make houses from plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time and feared nothing except other mosasauruses.
His long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set of teeth on the hard palate, which meant that nothing in its path could escape.
We cannot say for certain, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that would enter the water; even a huge dinosaur like the T-Rex would not be a match for him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had some of their own strange or unusual things for a feast, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor men and women would eat their food sitting on chairs, the wealthy preferred to organize banquets where they would recline on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not contain foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to appease the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard in front of the temple and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The largest part of the everyday life of a Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard; the shops were merely open stalls overlooking the street. Stone was used for building houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian," there were numerous differences among the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that somewhere at the beginning of its creation this large document on parchment (its dimensions are 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Well, most likely the label was added purely for marking.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was led by "Vichy" French. These were the French who, in 1940, made peace with the Germans and joined them instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated the south of France and headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work in cooperation, i.e., a society.
The word civilization originates from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which in a way also defines the size of the community.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. Civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and equitable dissemination.
Smaller cultures usually disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence, so they are often not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with Congress as the only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, which were often uncooperative in enforcing all its legislative documents.
He also had no right to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
It was necessary to have unanimous approval from all states before members could be altered, and the states took the central administration so lightly that their representatives were often absent from the sessions.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, was the second most successful team in the world and they were the winners of the World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international games or Olympic events.
Japan is made up of almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical representations.
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name of this island as "Ilha Formosa," or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating the transformation of indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894 - 1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, granting Japan sovereignty over Taiwan, which it ruled until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photo format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The ratio of dimensions of this format is considered to be 3:2 (divided by 12 to get the simplest whole number ratio).
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) are equal to or nearly approximate this ratio.
The rule of thirds, often misused and frequently mocked, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while simultaneously maintaining a measure of order in the image.
It states that the most striking place for the main subject is at the intersections of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, oversight began to be exercised over the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful.
The Christian religion has connected European states for thousands of years, despite differences in language and customs.
With her inexhaustible power, she influenced everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds exist precisely for that reason.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
It turned out that the strategy was effective, as it interrupted the supply of key military and civilian resources, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the last two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire parts of the ocean, thereby posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Considering that responses to this tactic were limited, Germany anticipated a similar response to its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of the majority of citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
To accept a job at the New York company Edison, Tesla moved to the United States in 1884.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each period of China or each ruling family represented a distinct dynasty.
There was also an unstable era of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most famous period of all was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted sixty years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce warfare occurred between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the throne in the vast palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political outcomes such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
Also, after the revolution, occupations were open to all men who applied, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the army, because instead of military ranks being based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed people from the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that were beyond his ordinary life. He often went to contemplate in the cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Nur" (light).
The cave itself, which has survived various times, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
Situated on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it is hard to find it, even if one knows it exists. After entering the cave, complete isolation occurs.
Nothing more can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, is one of the many large pyramidal structures that pay tribute to the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, consists of several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "with the arch" symbol looks like a V, and the "down the arch symbol" looks like a paperclip or a square missing the bottom side.
"Up" means you should start from the top and push the bow, while "down" means you should start from the frog (the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Raising the bow usually produces a quieter sound, while lowering the bow produces a stronger and more assertive one.
Feel free to write your markings in pencil, but remember that printed articulation marks are there for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
Terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two small children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), along with the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced on October 6, 1789, to move to Paris from Versailles, driven by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a mob of people who were screaming and shouting threats directed at the king and queen.
The crowd ordered the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the mob waved the head of a royal guardsman killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino citizens themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover the majority of costs and interest on securities that circulated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the enormous profit derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people represented the fundamental gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must also understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The era in which these events took place is often called the Late Middle Ages, and it is a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and after it follows the Late Middle Ages, which officially ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas: that technological development proceeds on a path that is beyond cultural and political influences and that, in turn, technology has its "effects" on societies which are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that a motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically sustainable for just a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher frequency of road accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a significant dose of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture related to that geography would emerge, which, in accordance with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around the year 400 and lasted until around the year 1100.
His status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned carrying gifts, such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
At just this time, the transfer of the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris was executed.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th - 11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West could lag behind by some 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest inventions of that era, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is farming conducted to produce enough food solely for the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses saved seeds, native to a given ecoregion, in combination with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signify their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to show the importance of socialization is to look at some tragic cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or physical abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "brutal" or wild. Some wild children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this kind of child abandonment occurs because parents refuse to accept the child's severe intellectual and physical disabilities.
The feral children may have experienced severe abuse in childhood or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
It is claimed for some that they were raised by animals; for others, it is said that they lived alone in the wilderness.
When fully raised by animals that are not humans, feral children exhibit behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely like the behavior of those animals that took care of them, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, learning through the "scaffolding" system goes a step further.
Metacognitive scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that is provided to individuals, through which they go through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is actually a type of scaffolder, as well as the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual supports are an integral part of the software and should review, encourage, and explain procedures that might be too complicated for students to carry out on their own.
Children are placed in foster families for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, yet it still happens.
We consider the foster care system a protective zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, caring caregivers, continuous education, and reliable healthcare.
Family accommodation for children should provide all the necessities that were lacking in the homes from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of use and access to satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important purposes of using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal involvement" and "maintained relationships" as new motivational aspects in their study of audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
It is particularly claimed that if you interpret microexpressions correctly, you can notice if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his work "The President's Speech," indicated that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even believes that such abilities in understanding human behavior might also be possessed by animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two forms of genetic variation: hidden and unhidden.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination affect the constant mixing of variations between the two gene pools in each generation.
In the savanna, a primate with a digestive tract similar to that of a human struggles to meet its amino acid needs from the plant sources available to it.
Even if this is not done, serious consequences may occur: growth of depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
Plant resources that are the easiest to access were the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but primates like us have difficulty digesting them if they are not cooked.
In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides a large amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
When all is considered, it shouldn't surprise us if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in roughly the same way as savanna chimpanzees do today.
Interruption of sleep is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleeping period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be accomplished with a relatively quiet alarm clock that would bring you to a conscious state without fully waking you up.
If you reset the clock during sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known diuretics) before sleep, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in that person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and tranquility.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only things standing in the way of this goal are our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they were expanded with the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of comprehensive love.
Through Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. By visualizing different deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, conflicts between systems, processes, and cultures led to those two countries becoming antagonistic.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It is planned to last 40 years, and the fight would be real, through conflicts of smaller countries representing the interests of larger military powers, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, as well as in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Transoceanic shipping is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and large quantities of goods across the ocean.
The traditional job of the navy has been to ensure that your country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while also preventing the enemy from transporting its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and weapons across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easier access to milk, wool, meat, and hide.
Domestic goats were mostly kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often accompanied by goatherds who were mostly children or young people, similar to the more well-known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
Tracks for wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the early railways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses pulling the wagons to achieve higher speeds and carry larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of that time.
Railroad sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it gradually became clear that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
This has become a common practice, but the iron has caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the cart.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, rails made of solid iron were used for the first time.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. People started to walk upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as is common.
Refinement in bipedalism is found in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus might have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the ecological movement, and we can even become activists to somewhat reduce suffering in the future.
In many cases, this is like symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and extinguish them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and the problems have become greater due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After adoption by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away, to the printing office of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides."
John Nixon was the first to publicly read this document on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and was read to his troops on July 9 in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
25 of Dunlap's records that are still known to exist are the oldest extant copies of the document. The hand-written original has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still make them look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet with claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Practically all computers in use today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits in computer jargon.
It does not have to be immediately obvious that it is a case of internal poisoning. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open package of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the label to see specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term originates from ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects very well adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and common bed bugs are species that stay with their parents for a long time and are adapted to living in the nest or home of the host.
Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known across the United States, making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged individuals.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS symptoms than men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest or in the interest of their child.
These couples may decide to plan the adoption of a baby.
During adoption, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main task of science is to understand the way the world functions using the scientific method. This method actually governs most scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only thing, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and observing also guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's conceptions of all scientific questions, including psychology, were respected.
As the knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many noted rhythms in physiology and behavior often critically depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic biological rhythms that are not merely responses to the periodic alternation of external influences have been observed in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue with a free-running period even in the absence of external signals.
Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading indicators that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the genetic material that is affected, and whether the affected cells are reproductive cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including the plant and animal wildlife.
Field activities include, for example: hunting, fishing, photographing, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem data.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small villages by car to get to their workplaces, passing by those whose workplace is exactly where they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation process, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this high-carbon consumption economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported the evolution of humans over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints and why do they make mistakes every day? Are the transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more serious happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers mostly behave within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, connections have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of facilities on the road.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily evade enemies and more effectively find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage that they can fold their wings against their bodies.
This gives them a greater choice of different small places to hide from predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years earlier, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people believed that he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This sounds reasonable, since it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with its occasional width of six miles.
A full twenty percent of the water flowing from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing surpassed the pyramids of Giza in their size and technical excellence of construction.
The Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which by then were already over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
Vatican uses Italian in its laws and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious rites.
All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, considering that they can be found in nature in their native form and can be relatively easily extracted with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, had a theory that everything is made of a mixture of just one or a few of the four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
This resembled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, plasma, although it was also theorized that they transform into new substances, in order to form what we see.
Alloys are actually mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that consist of a small amount of non-metals such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that billions of them can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Hence, the pen was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, when new writing methods emerged, the pen was relegated to a lower status and used less frequently.
People now write messages on a computer screen, without ever having been near a typesetting machine.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will turn into when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle of taking energy to assemble a core with many protons and neutrons.
It's roughly like pushing a heavy cart uphill. The fission then releases a certain amount of energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
Thinner under the lunar sea, thicker under the hills.
There might be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what motivates people or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they matured into adults.
These theories study what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they do, and which things from their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two forms of behavior can emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. On one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels the need to change everything the team has worked on and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is the one responsible for the team's success and failure.
Such behavior often results in a gap between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams need to meet the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team often function as a contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet according to different time zones which local management might not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
"The 'Invisible Team' is a management team to which each member reports. The Invisible Team sets standards for each member."
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of applying organizational learning concepts in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are efficiently utilized in an organization's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can come to the fore.
As a result, the process of organizing in which people work together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that will meet the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Eynjel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of productivity.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of cognitive abilities. This narrows the field of research and makes it much more accurate.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists' claims in their research.
For a long time, it has been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of data and material for creating simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although AI carries a strong connotation towards science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and client inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such matters have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence (AI) system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and for military purposes, given that it is embedded in several home computers and software applications for video games.
Field trips are a big part of every classroom. Often, the teacher would like to take her students to places where traveling by bus is not an option.
Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual tours. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their class.
Virtually sharing experiences from the excursion is also an excellent way to reflect on the excursion and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; the website is redesigned every year, but old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with messy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve the writing in order to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to become more resourceful regarding the world around them." The need to stimulate audience interest inspires students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their views in the context of others' texts, as well as present their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital city of Canada, and it has a whole range of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, while the north is a haven of the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this further emphasizes Ontario as something that foreigners essentially consider Canadian.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost entirely uninhabited wilderness.
For a comparison of the population that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the USA than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest island and a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the mainland, and it was largely adopted in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, since the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is useful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to something they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be resolute in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and also the Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake in 1755.
Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Dar al-Badi'a, and Spanish traders who established trading bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but all of this is intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
Goma was destroyed in 2002 by the lava of Mount Nyiragongo, which covered most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is quite safe, any visits outside of Goma should be thoroughly examined in order to understand the state of the ongoing conflicts in the North Kivu province.
This city is also the base from which the ascent to the Nyiragongo volcano begins, along with some of the cheapest tracking of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation places it among tourist attractions, and there is also an airport in it.
Due to the threat of desert sand, Timbuktu was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1990.
That was one of Henry Louis Gates' main stops while filming "Wonders of the African World" on PBS.
This city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it has more of an Arab than African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while its southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each home to a variety of wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the main attraction of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It is also worth considering purchasing the wildcard, which allows entry to certain South African parks or all national parks of the Republic of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name, and it is a place that many tourists consider the main focus.
A series of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline is compared to a shimmering bar chart, made evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Most of the urban part of Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This place was taken by British colonizers as their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good starting point.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², of which one third is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in this area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As intercity buses are often full, it is advised to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi is a fast and comfortable way to reach nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, and the bridge is 378 meters long with two lanes, each 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully opened for use in September 2017, when the completion of customs checkpoints on the Brazilian side is expected.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group that inhabited present-day eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in sustainable agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaicurú and Payaguá, which survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, which was formerly called "The Giant Province of India," was established in the 16th century as a result of encounters between Spanish conquistadors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción has managed to retain much of Paraguay's indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
You can also see smaller tournaments and matches here at other times of the year.
For all news about tournaments and information on where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Association (Asociación Argentina de Polo).
The official Falkland Islands currency is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), whose value is set equivalent to the value of one British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands and within Stanley credit cards, and US dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British currency and United States currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine which method of payment is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical climate; in the summer months, temperatures over 30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel much colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park management, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
Regardless of their docile appearance, bison, North American and European elk, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not maintain an appropriate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Additionally, be aware that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented food, and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has slightly fewer than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has officially held the title of the capital of Samoa since 1959.
Luka was the site of a notorious naval conflict in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships, except for one British cruiser, were sunk. Nearly two hundred American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Considering that Auckland spreads across two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular ones are in three areas:
The beaches of the North Shore (in the area of North Harbor) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy with safe swimming areas, and most of them have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
Those are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a rich range of shops lining the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer "Number One" is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that are good to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines might withstand the journey better.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
For Australians, the coffee "flat white" is an unfamiliar concept. A short black is "espresso," cappuccino comes topped with a large amount of whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but exceptional.
Throughout the year, numerous trips to the reef are organized, and injuries caused by any of these reasons on the reef are rare.
However, follow the authorities' advice, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of the town of 1770. They can sometimes be found outside of this timeframe.
There are sharks, however, they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away from you.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, although you may also be able to book other types of accommodation through them, such as campgrounds.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, provided transportation to/from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel arrangements.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents you need for the destination you are visiting (e.g., a visa).
Any amendment or request should first be sent to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most attendees consider it a significant part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will need to arrive early to secure a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages may have stopped, there might be parts of the festival where music is played late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic during winter, check the location of the hut, as passing through the ice causes quite terrifying sounds for those most affected.
Cruises in Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually put a lot of effort into maximizing the time and money visitors spend. There are generally no windows or clocks, and the exits are hard to find.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and to encourage them to stay on the premises.
In some places, alcoholic drinks are served on the house. However, drunkenness affects judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high latitudes or across mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or subzero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, traction is weak, and you cannot drive as if you are on asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short period to get you stuck.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow, as well as fogging or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snowy and icy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic generally operates without interruption throughout the year.
A safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to land trips where you can see amazing African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to slowly approach cars, so the standard equipment provides a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you'll have a better chance of spotting them with binoculars.
Walking safari (also called “nature walk,” “hiking safari,” or “walking tour”) consists of hiking, which lasts a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, as it hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for the year 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since late March, most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus are not valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
The expected price of most event tickets will range from 2,500 to 130,000 Japanese yen, and the price of a typical ticket will be around 7,000 yen.
Ironing helps wet clothes to dry. Numerous hotels allow renting an iron and ironing board, even if you don't have them in your room.
If an iron is not available to you, or if you do not like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if it is available.
Be careful that the fabric does not become too hot (which can lead to shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are several methods for purifying water, with some providing better results against certain threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in others, a few minutes are needed.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned, then you should consider purchasing water from reputable companies in a sealed bottle.
Travelers may encounter pest animals that they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritations, or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Contagious diseases or dangerous animals that can harm or kill humans by force are usually not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excises at certain locations.
Passengers traveling to countries with high taxes can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, as it often passes through isolated rural areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be ready to react quickly: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns dominate.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on the preceding and following sections—typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Interestingly, however, the mobile phone network is much stronger here than along many other parts of the road, for example, in the Pennsylvania Wilds reserve.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and diverse, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastry is common, with apples baked throughout the year, while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what is called, depending on the region, a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is typically used.
Considering it encompasses 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that covers a wide range of regional cuisines across the country.
But, when used without additional qualifiers, the term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a range of simply spiced dishes, among which the predominant flavors preferred by the Javanese include peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang from both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, but they can pose a safety issue due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off the horse but their foot gets stuck in the stirrup, they may be dragged if the horse continues to run. To minimize this risk, several preventive measures can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots, with a heel and a smooth, quite narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the leather stirrup to drop from the saddle if pulled by the rider at the moment of falling.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with numerous big granite walls and cliffs.
From the highest peaks, breathtaking views unfold. Mountaineers from all parts of the world continuously establish new routes among the boundless potentials of the mountain sides.
Snow mountain sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main activity during the trip, and many enthusiasts, often known as "ski bums," plan entire vacations spent skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is extremely old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BCE!
Alpine skiing as a sport has existed since at least the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Hiking with skiing: This activity is often called rural skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to, but usually does not include ski touring or alpine style climbing; the latter is performed on steep terrain and requires much sturdier skis and boots.
Imagine a ski route as similar to a hiking route.
In good conditions, you'll be able to cover a slightly greater distance than walking – but you will very rarely reach the speed of Nordic skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean you have to go through visa requirements and passport control multiple times.
In that regard, however, the Schengen Area functions similarly to a single country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can mostly cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for visas for each of the Schengen member states, which saves time, money, and avoids paperwork.
There is no universal definition according to which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax agencies define products over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit might be lower in places such as North America compared to Europe.
Handcrafted products can be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than some similar mass-produced items.
Raising reindeer is important for the life of the Sami people, and the culture within trade is also important for many who engage in other professions.
However, even traditionally, not all Sami were largely dedicated to reindeer herding, but lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and primarily used reindeer for hauling and carrying loads.
Today, many Samis engage in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, a region located in the Sami area.
Even though it is common, especially outside the Roma community, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it evokes negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma.

You may also wish to hear the advice of other governments in addition to your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different scenarios compared to Europeans or Arabs.
Reports are only brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The presented views are often superficial, general, and simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is a generic term for any weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruptions, or lead to loss of human life.
Bad weather can happen anywhere in the world, and there are different types that depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and consequences of severe weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, flooding, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal hazardous weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Passengers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks posed by bad weather in the area where they are located, as it may affect their travel plans.
Anyone who wishes to travel to a country that could be considered a war zone would need to undergo professional training in advance.
If you type "hostile environment course" into an internet search, you will likely get the address of a local company.
The course will usually cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, mainly with practical experience.
The course will usually last from 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons handling training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but there are few publications dedicated to war zones.
Passengers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documents for their return.
Willingness of the government to issue passports that do not specify the person's gender (X) or documents that are updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies equally.
Checks at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the era following September 11, 2001.
Pre-operative transgender individuals should not expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are a backward flow of waves that separate from the beach, often present on a reef or similar locations.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper parts and a fast current to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion when attempting to swim upstream, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is not harder than it normally is.
Try to aim for somewhere you won't get caught again or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you might want to wait to be rescued.
Shock upon returning occurs earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapted to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you adapted to a new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding towards you, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
People may not expect that travelers returning home also need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show in the pyramid is one of the most interesting things here for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is set as the background and the narrator of a long story.
Scenes are displayed on pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
On the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, many nations claim rights and have the most bases there, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into a plateau, and then reappear to form the 360 km Ellsworth Mountain range, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak Vinson reaching 4,892 meters.
In remote places without mobile phone signal coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a replacement for a mobile phone because to make a call, you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
This service is often used when traveling by ship, including yachts, as well as for expeditions that require remote data and voice communication.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular with those who are finishing school, as it allows them to take a gap year before college without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, attending a course abroad during a gap year can improve the prospects for advancing towards higher education in one's home country.
There is usually a tuition fee for enrolling in any of these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for sailing. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and on the coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, a yacht is not necessary for you.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boat rowing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand correspond to this, but it is otherwise very unique (for example, in the Netherlands, that number is from one to forty).
The majority of different Baltic cruises have an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of whole days, and return to sleep on the ship during the night.
If you go ashore only as part of ship excursions, a special visa is not required for you (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures highlight Berlin in Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not even close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all backgrounds and age groups, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
That is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and dislikes regarding other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how an aircraft works and what happens during a flight can help them overcome the fear that is based on the unknown or the inability to have control over events.
Courier companies are well-paid for the fast delivery of items. Timing is often very crucial when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes or for smaller firms, it was a problem.
If they shipped the items via air freight, on some routes it might have taken days to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to get through faster was to send the baggage as checked. Airline regulations won't allow them to send luggage without a passenger, which is where you come into the story.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to set aside a thick pile of money for that privilege (or, even better, persuade the company you work for to do it instead of you).
However, this is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the usual economy fare for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point in even asking for discounts for business class and first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay extra for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered due to ethnic conflict.
This conflict resulted in the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova in 1994, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been re-established between the two parts of Moldova, despite the failure in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, it is the second largest port after Istanbul, and also a very good transportation hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is today a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center located in a large bay surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass walls, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than that of traditional Turkey.

Please bear in mind that you are visiting a site of mass graves, as well as a place that holds almost immeasurable significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived being here, and many more whose loved ones were killed or exploited to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this place with the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by marking or engraving graffiti on objects.
Official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understands it, and actually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, considering that it has been established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are automatically announced in a large number of languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, unfriendly, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is to behave nicely - like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make getting around much easier.
Unfriendly behavior of Parisians quickly evaporates if you show a little basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and contains a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has an exceptionally wide range of plant communities due to its range of microclimates, varying soils, and diverse elevation levels.
This area is also home to an exceptionally large number of diverse species of animals and birds.
Rare animal species can be found here, including the brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cats, and the western capercaillie, as well as many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts below the knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide skirts for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own skirt, especially with bright colors, you will bring a smile to the face of the monk or nun at the entrance.
According to the same rule, men must wear pants that cover the knees.
And you can borrow these from the stock at the entrance, but that clothing is not washed after each wearing, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men, it's a universal size!
Majorcan cuisine, like those in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and overall uses olive oil.
A simple popular dinner, especially during summer, is "pa amb oli": bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word "Sie," which represents the word "You," are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to differentiate between some verbs and the object.
It can also be said that it facilitates reading, although writing is somewhat complicated due to the need to determine whether the verb or adverb is used in the form of a pronoun.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, because most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are č and g, considering that their pronunciation varies depending on the accompanying consonant.
Also make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: "caro" means dear, while "carro" means carriage.
The Persian language has relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar primer would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.

However, people who speak a little Spanish might quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Premodern observatories are mostly obsolete today, and they exist as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution during their heyday was not the problem it is today, they can usually be found in cities or on campuses, where they were more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes are large facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Observing cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China where plum blossoms were the flowers of choice.
In Japan, the first celebrations of cherry blossom were organized by the emperor exclusively for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look their best when in a natural environment, so resist the urge to remove "just one" specimen.
If you are visiting a formally arranged garden, collecting "samples" will also get you expelled, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit and very easy to get around, and you can buy almost everything upon arrival.
But considering that it is located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is rare).
A couple of buses also go north to Hebron, where the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives is located.
Make sure that the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron itself, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
River routes in the interior can be a good basis for planning a vacation.
For example, a tour of the castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, a cruise to interesting places on the Danube, or a boat ride along the Iria Canal.
They also define routes for popular walking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition to spend Easter night without sleeping, at some open place in order to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is quite possible that this spring and fertility ritual originated before the appearance of Christians.
Traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, while communities often start celebrating as soon as midnight strikes to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to travel, making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during the winter, you will experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, considering that the sky will be dark more or less throughout the entire day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is often not a problem, you will be able to enjoy the stars as well.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal compared to what Westerners might be accustomed to.
Suits are part of business attire, and colleagues address each other by surname or title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to seek approval from their superiors for every decision made, and they are also expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
