This not only confirms the widely-accepted theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils usually cannot offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal are chestnut-colored at the top and light or carotenoid-colored at the bottom.
This discovery also allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Due to the fact that dinosaur feathers did not have developed rachises (known as "feather shafts"), but did possess other feather characteristics (barbs and barbules), researchers inferred that the rachis might have developed from the later evolution of other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers shows that they were not used for flying, but for regulating temperature or display. Researchers believe that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows mature dinosaur feathers rather than juvenile feathers.
The researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of an adult dinosaur, not juvenile feathers.

Current senator and First Lady of Argentina, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, announced her candidacy for president last night in the city of La Plata, located 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.
Kirchner announced her intention to run for president at the Teatro Argentino, which was also the venue where, as a member of the Buenos Aires provincial delegation, she launched her senatorial campaign in 2005.
The cause of this debate is due to controversies over relief and reconstruction spending after Hurricane Katrina; some fiscal conservatives jokingly call it "Bush's New Orleans Agreement."
The criticism of the liberal party's reconstruction work focuses on awarding reconstruction contracts to those considered Washington insiders.

The community's anger has led to the current drafting of a policy that targets sexual content on websites with millions of pieces of publicly licensed media.
Most of the completed research is theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate the observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team is looking for is caused by the tidal gravity between the galaxy dark matter and the Milky Way dark matter.
Just as the moon's gravity creates tides on Earth, the Milky Way also exerts gravitational force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists can conclude that the effect of dark matter on other dark matter is the same as on ordinary matter.
The theory suggests that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located in a place similar to a halo of the galaxy and consists of many small particles.
The news report shows white smoke coming out from the nuclear power plant.
The local government warned residents near the nuclear power plant to stay indoors, turn off the air conditioning, and not to drink tap water.

Authorities speculate that this indicates the containers storing uranium fuel on site may have already ruptured and are leaking.
Dr. Tony Moll discovered extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that this new variant is "very disturbing and concerning because its mortality rate is very high."
Dr. Mo believes that some patients may have contracted this bacteria in the hospital, and at least two are hospital staff members.
Within a year, one infected person may infect 10 to 15 close contacts.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters, alone in a voting booth, fill out their chosen candidate on a pre-printed paper and place it into an envelope.
After election staff verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter register.
The French election law adopts rather strict criteria to compile the election procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes in the box at the start of voting, and that no additional envelopes are inserted except those by duly checked and authorized voters.
The candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the electoral process. In the evening, under strict supervision, the volunteers count the votes according to the designated procedures.

Schneider testified via video at the U.S. Air Force Base in his hometown.
Besides Wednesday's match, Carpenedo also participated in two individual events in the championship.
Her first event was the slalom, but she was unable to complete it. Out of 116 competitors, 36 had the same result in that event.
Her other competition was the giant slalom, where she ranked tenth in the women's combined category with a total time of 4 minutes 41.30 seconds, 2 minutes 11.60 seconds slower than the top-ranked Austrian athlete Claudia Loesch, and 1 minute 09.02 seconds slower than the ninth-placed Hungarian athlete Gonji Dani.
In the women's sitting group, four skiers did not finish the race, while in the giant slalom event, 45 out of a total of 117 participants did not get a ranking.
The Central State police have found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested the 5 individuals who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Qian De La Xie Ka Suo Lan Ji stated that the defendant appeared in court with their face covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, fortunately, no one was injured.
However, the driver's head was severely injured.
The road at the scene of the accident is temporarily closed to allow emergency personnel to rescue the driver from the red Audi TT.
At first, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Thereafter, Adekoya was charged with murdering her son and stood trial at the High Court of Edinburgh.
She is currently being detained, awaiting prosecution and trial, but because her photos have been widely circulated, any witnesses' evidence may be influenced.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scotland's judicial system is different, and the court believes that publishing photos could constitute prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee pointed out, "It seems to be a dangerous thing if journalists publish photos of suspects and the like."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is fully responsible for the prosecution, told reporters that no further comments would be made at least before the prosecution.
According to leaked information, the document involves border disputes, with Palestine hoping to use the pre-1967 Middle East war borders as a basis.
According to reports, other discussion topics include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the Jordan River issue.
Israel demands that after signing a ceasefire agreement, it continues to station troops in the Jordan Valley area for 10 years, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to Israeli troops being stationed for 5 years.
The shooters participating in the supplementary pest control experiment will be closely supervised by rangers, the experiment will also be monitored, and its effectiveness will be evaluated.
The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) is collaborating with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) to recruit qualified volunteers to participate in the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of park conservation and heritage at the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four marksmen selected for the first shooting operation have undergone comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in to establish a provisional electoral council (CEP) composed of 9 members.
This is the fifth CEP for Martell in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the former CEP to resign as part of measures to push the country towards new elections.
This committee is Martelly's response to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
The protests were triggered by the absence of elections (some elections have not been held since 2011) and sometimes escalated into violent clashes.
There were approximately 60 reports of iPod malfunctions due to overheating, resulting in six fires, with four people sustaining minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan has stated that authorities have noted 27 incidents related to the device.
METI announced last week that Apple had reported another 34 cases of overheating, which the company considers "not serious."
The ministry's response indicated that Apple's delay in releasing the report is "truly regrettable."
The earthquake in Mariana occurred at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands stated that the country has not received any damage reports.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami at that time.
A former Philippine policeman hijacked a bus carrying Hong Kong tourists in the Philippine capital, Manila, and took them as hostages.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on the tourists with an M16 rifle.
Some of the hostages have been rescued, and at least six people have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, and a Filipino photographer were released early.
Later, those photographers replaced an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a medical career.
He received training as an obstetrician and started working at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his time working in the hospital, Liggins began using his spare time to research the issue of premature births.
His research shows that taking a hormone will accelerate fetal lung growth.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators found two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestling athletes also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first extreme queen and my first manager. Luna passed away on a night with two moons, just as unique and strong as she was."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was as eccentric as I am... maybe even more so... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she has gone to a better place."
Among the 1,400 respondents interviewed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election that she believes Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
34% of respondents share the same view, hoping that Queen Elizabeth II will be the last monarch of Australia.
From an extreme perspective, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to participate in the 100m and 200m freestyle events and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have cast doubts on his health condition.
He has been unable to take the medication needed to overcome the pain because these drugs are banned by the Olympics.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri in the United States, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
In early February, several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of water and organic materials on Earth, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth was formed, because a long time ago comets collided with Earth.
53-year-old Cuomo began his tenure as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described these rumors as "political noise and stupidity."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration of the United States claims that the NextGen system can shorten the flight paths of airplanes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of the outdated technology of ground radar, enabling air traffic controllers to more accurately locate planes and provide pilots with more precise information.
There are no additional transportation options available, overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there are no parking lots or park-and-ride facilities on the ground.
Due to public concerns about the lack of transportation, the match might be forced to play behind closed doors without any team supporters.
On Thursday, a study published in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that it has long been believed that evolution requires a long time, but due to the breeding between local Darwin's finches (Geospiza fortes) and the introduced cactus finches (Geospiza conirostris), a new species evolved in just two generations.
Gold can be shaped into different forms and can also be rolled into fine shapes.
It can be pulled into fine strands, then twisted and braided. Alternatively, it can also be pressed or rolled into sheets.
Gold can also be made into very thin sheets and adhered to other metals. Sometimes it is even thin enough to be used for decorating hand-drawn illustrations in books, known as "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can use purple cabbage juice to make an indicator.
The color change of cabbage juice depends on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemicals.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions in the chemical substance being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton after removing an electron (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two kinds of dry powder together, then use clean, damp hands to squeeze them into balls.
The moisture in the hands will react with the outer layer of the substance, resulting in a strange texture and forming a shell-like shape.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost all houses had flush toilets connected to an intricate sewage system.
Traces of sewage systems have been found in the homes of Minoan towns on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, and men and women would use them together.
When you make a call to someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space will almost immediately reflect back after receiving a call.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
A gigantic rocket needs to reach over 100 feet high to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in extraordinary ways. The greatest contribution of the wheel is that it has given us simpler and faster means of transportation.
It brings us trains, cars, and many other different kinds of transportation.
Under them are medium-sized felines, and the medium-sized prey they eat includes rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Finally, many small felines (including free-range pet cats) will eat a variety of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success lies in proper division of labor, with each cat assigned a specific task, allowing them to avoid competition with other cats.
Lions are the most social of the cat family, living in groups known as "prides."
A pride is composed of one to three adult male lions who are related, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Female individuals usually have close relationships and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
The behavior of lion prides is similar to that of wolf packs or dog packs; their behavior is surprisingly similar to lions (but different from other large cats) and is extremely lethal to their prey.
The tiger is an all-around athlete; it can climb (though not very well), swim, leap long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers and lions, leopards and jaguars all belong to the same genus (Panthera). Among the feline animals, only these four types can roar.
The roar of a tiger differs from the loud roar of a lion and is more like a low growl with bared teeth.
Leopard cats like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds whenever possible. Almost all the animals hunted by leopard cats are much smaller in size than the leopard cats themselves.
Scientists believe that leopard cats use their sense of smell to detect where prey has been on the ground to find animals to eat (prey).
Their night vision ability in the dark is very high, and they can move silently. The way leopard cats hunt for prey is by first blending into the environment surrounding the prey, then pouncing on it.
When a small group of organisms (a smaller population) separates from their main population where they were born (for example, crossing a mountain or river, or migrating to a new island, and are unable to easily return after reaching their destination), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from before.
In a new environment with different resources and competitors, this new group needs to develop habits or adaptive abilities that differ from before in order to become stronger competitors than ever.
The original group has not changed at all; they still need the same adaptability as before.
As time goes by, this new group begins to adapt to the new environment, and the differences between them and another group start to become greater.
Finally, after being tempered for thousands or even millions of years, these two groups of organisms will look completely different and can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which is the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants release the oxygen that humans need to breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants obtain food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build houses and make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so they feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw is filled with more than 70 knife-like sharp teeth, with additional teeth on the upper jaw, which means that nothing in its path can escape.
We are not sure, but it may have a forked tongue. Its diet includes sea turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even practice cannibalism.
It also attacks everything in the water. Even a giant dinosaur like the Tyrannosaurus rex is no match for it.
Although much of their food was similar to ours, the Romans also had their peculiar tastes and unusual banquet foods, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called dormouse.
Another difference is that poor people and women sit on chairs to eat, while wealthy people prefer to gather at banquets and recline while dining.
The food of ancient Rome could not possibly include ingredients that were transported to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, the ancient Romans did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa beans, and they had never tasted turkey.
The Babylonians would construct a main temple for each deity, which was regarded as the home of the deity.
People offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests try to satisfy the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Every temple has an open-style temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests are allowed to enter.
Sometimes, pyramid-shaped towers known as ziggurats are constructed as part of temples.
The top of the tower is the special sanctuary of the deities.
Due to the warm climate of the Middle East, houses have become less important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life takes place outdoors.
The women cooked in the backyard; the shops were just open counters facing the street. The stones were used for building houses.
Due to the lack of large forests in Canaan's territory, timber is extremely expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and during his westward voyage, he discovered the island and named it Greenland.
No matter what his discoveries were, the Eskimo tribe was already living there at that time.
Although each country has been "Scandinavia," there are still many differences in the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think that there is a treasure map drawn on the back of the "Declaration of Independence."
But the fact is not so. Although there are some words written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence is "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". This text is shown upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is already established that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was originally stored rolled up.
So adding symbols is likely just for labeling purposes.
The Normandy landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but southern France remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces advanced into southern France, and this offensive was called "Operation Dragoon."
The U.S. military and the Free French forces liberated southern France in just two weeks and then turned towards Germany.
Civilization refers to a single culture shared by a large group of people (i.e., society) who live and work together cooperatively.
The term “civilization” originates from the Latin word civilis (meaning civil), which is related to the Latin words civis (meaning citizen) and civitas (meaning city or city-state), defining to some extent the scale of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture signifies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, the continuation of cultural footprints, and a certain degree of dissemination.
The cultures of minority ethnic groups often vanish without leaving historical evidence, and thus cannot be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a fragile central government under the Articles of Confederation (having only Congress as its sole component).
The Congress lacked any power to levy taxes. Moreover, since there was no national executive or judiciary at the time, the Congress could only rely on the often uncooperative state governments to enforce all its laws.
The parliament also has no authority to overturn tax laws and tariffs between the various states.
The regulation requires unanimous consent from all states to be amended, yet these states do not respect the central government, and even their representatives often fail to attend.
The Italy national football team and the Germany national football team are tied for second in the world, and they were also the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include: soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern region, and Italians in that area also participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest one being Honshu), making it the world's 7th largest island country!
Since Japan has a group of islands, it is often referred to as an "archipelago" on a geographical level.
The origins of Taiwan can be traced back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, began reforming the indigenous people's grain production methods, and employed Chinese laborers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops gained control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki. This treaty ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, and Japan's rule over the island did not end until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, which are Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of this complex have been rebuilt, allowing visitors to better understand their original appearance.
Until 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, 35mm is the most common still image photography format in the world, and it was also the most widely used size at the end of the analog film photography era.
Although production still continues to this day, more importantly, the image sensor format of digital cameras that followed also adopted its aspect ratio.
The name of the 35mm format is a bit misleading, as it is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
This format's aspect ratio (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) can therefore be described as three to two.
Many common formats (such as the format of the Advanced Photo System) share the same or similar aspect ratio.
The often abused and mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates a sense of vibrancy while maintaining order in the image.
It points out that the most effective position of the subject is at the intersection points of the lines dividing the image into three equal parts horizontally and vertically (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church came under strict scrutiny for becoming wealthy and powerful.
For thousands of years, although there are still some differences in language and customs, Christianity has kept the relationships between European countries inextricably linked.
Its omnipresent power affects everyone, whether king or commoner.
One of the main tenets of Christianity states that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and hence the funds of the church exist.
The central power structure of the Roman Church has a history of a thousand years, and such concentrated power and money make many people question whether it aligns with the doctrine.
Following the outbreak of war, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proven effective in cutting off essential military and civilian supplies, but this blockade violates international law established by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom has deployed in international waters to prevent any vessels from entering the entire maritime area, posing a threat even to neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this strategy, Germany expects that its unrestricted submarine warfare would receive a similar response.
In the 1920s, most citizens and nations upheld positions of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities brought by war during World War I, countries hoped to avoid such situations from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work at the Edison Company located in New York City.
He arrived in America with four cents of savings, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there were unique ways to represent different periods; each stage of China or each ruling family was a unique dynasty.
Between every dynasty, there existed unstable periods with divided provinces. Among these periods, the most famous is the 60-year Three Kingdoms Period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars occurred as many nobles vied for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people losing their lives in the quest to ascend the highest throne of the Xi'an Great Palace.
Numerous social and political influences emerged one after another, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the idea that the state belongs to the people rather than a single ruler.
Additionally, after the revolution, all professions were opened to applications from all men, allowing the most ambitious and successful individuals to succeed.
The army is also in the same situation because ranks are no longer tied to class but are determined by capability.
The French Revolution simultaneously awakened many oppressed working-class masses in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond earthly life. He often went to a cave called Hira on Mount Noor (meaning "light") to meditate.
The cave was formed through the test of time, giving a distinct spiritual image to Muhammad.
Resting at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is isolated from the world.
In fact, even if you know of its existence, it's hard to find. When you are in the cave, you are completely isolated from the world.
Here, you will only see the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains. Looking out from the cave, you see and hear only a small piece of the world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC and is one of the many large pyramids constructed to commemorate deceased pharaohs.
Situated in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, the Giza Plateau (also known as the "Giza Necropolis") features several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to commemorate Pharaoh Khufu's wives and family members.
The symbol for "up bow" looks like a V, and the symbol for "down bow" looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
The meaning of "upward" is that you should start pushing the bow from the tip, and the meaning of "downward" is that you should start pulling the bow from the base (where you hold the bow).
The up-bow usually produces a softer sound, while the down-bow produces a stronger and more solid sound.
Feel free to write down your own markings, but remember that the printed bowing markings have musical reasons, so generally, they should be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister Madame Élisabeth were forced by a group of market women to return from the Palace of Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris by carriage, surrounded by crowds who were roaring and loudly threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows.
A rioter suddenly waved the head of a royal guard, which had been severed at the Palace of Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The United States' imperialism conquered the Philippines, and in the end, the war expenses were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime, with most of the expenses and bond interest paid in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super profits generated by the long-exploited Filipinos will constitute the basic earnings of American imperialism.
Before understanding the Knights Templar, we must comprehend the sequence of events that led to its establishment.
The time of the incident is often considered the High Middle Ages in European history, which is the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 - 1300 AD).
Before the High Middle Ages was the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally believed to have ended around 1500 AD.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a range of active ideas, from technological push or technological imperatives to, in a strict sense, the belief that human destiny is driven by deep-seated logic related to scientific laws and their technological manifestations.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two common perspectives: the developmental trajectory of technology itself largely transcends cultural or political influences, and technology, in turn, inherently "impacts" society rather than being constrained by society.
For example, someone might say that cars will inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, if there are only a few cars, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible, so new production methods will be developed to reduce the cost of owning cars.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to more road accidents, resulting in new medical technology inventions to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism has significant cultural determinism elements, coming from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Under the backdrop of romanticism, the geographical environment shapes the individual, while customs and cultures related to the geographical environment emerge over time. Those cultural customs are more in harmony with the positioning of society than with arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Since the year 400 AD, it has been famous as a luxury goods center, continuing until around 1100 AD.
In the 12th century, its status gradually declined, mainly because the Crusades brought back spoils such as silk and spices, which were more popular than the goods offered in the Byzantine market.
From this moment on, the title of fashion capital of Constantinople was gracefully handed over to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak of popularity in the 10th to 11th centuries and the 14th century.
The initial dress designs were greatly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication between the east and west, the popular styles in the west lagged 25 to 30 years behind those in the east.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own clothing style. The most significant development at the time came from the Crusades, leading people to start using buttons to fasten clothes.
Sustainable agriculture advocates producing just enough food to feed the farmers and their families.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple and mostly organic system that uses seeds native to the local ecological zone, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in sustainable agriculture, and this is still common in many developing countries today.
Subculture brings together a group of like-minded individuals who feel ignored by societal norms, and it allows them to develop a sense of identity.
The uniqueness of a subculture can stem from the age, ethnicity, class, region, and/or gender of its members.
The distinctive qualities that determine a subculture can be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexual orientation, geography, or a combination of different factors.
Members of a subculture often express their identity through distinctive and symbolic ways, including clothing, behavior, and jargon.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is by citing examples of a few unfortunate children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse during their upbringing, did not receive social education from adults.
These children are generally referred to as "feral children." Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their parents), while other cases involve children being abandoned because their parents refuse to accept the children's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Before being abandoned or running away from home, wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma.
Some people are said to have been raised by animals, while others have survived alone in the wild.
When a wild child is raised by non-human animals, their behavior (within physical limitations) is almost entirely similar to that of the animals that care for them, such as feeling fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, while the scaffolding theory goes a step further.
Scaffolding theory is not a learning method, but a form of support that assists people who are experiencing a new learning process, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be virtual or real. In other words, teachers can be a form of scaffolding, and the Microsoft Office paperclip assistant can also be a form.
The virtual scaffolding is internalized within the software, aiming to pose questions, inspire, and explain processes that students find difficult to handle on their own.
There are many reasons why a child is placed in foster care, such as neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment lacking care, love, and education, but these children are experiencing all of this.
We believe the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system will provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide them with all the necessities they lacked in their previous home.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The obvious characteristics of the Internet have expanded the scope of use and ways of satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998), in their study on users' reactions to websites, identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" as new motivations.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in interpreting fleeting micro-expressions and facial movements.
Especially, it is claimed that accurately interpreting micro-expressions can reveal whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks pointed out in his article "The President's Speech" that even people who cannot understand the content of a speech due to brain damage can still accurately judge the speaker's sincerity.
He even suggested that domestic animals like dogs might also have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century shows that genetic variation is divided into two types: recessive and dominant.
Mutations introduce new genetic variations and selectively remove dominant variations from the gene pool.
Separation and recombination cause changes in the gene pools of each generation.
On the savannah, primates (whose digestive systems are similar to humans) have difficulty obtaining the necessary amino acids from available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure can lead to severe consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and even ultimately result in death.
The easiest plant resources to obtain are proteins from leafy or leguminous plants, but if these plants are not cooked, they are difficult for primates like us to digest.
On the contrary, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide a large amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Considering all of this, it is not surprising that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" using methods similar to those adopted by chimpanzees on the savanna today.
Waking up during sleep is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and then falling back asleep within a short period (ten to sixty minutes).
As long as you use a relatively quiet alarm clock that makes you aware without completely waking you up, you can easily achieve it.
If you tend to reset the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get up to turn it off.
Other choices based on biological rhythms include drinking a large amount of fluids (especially water or tea known to be diuretic) before sleeping, causing one to be forced to get up to urinate.
The inner peace one possesses is inversely related to the tension one experiences physically and mentally.
The less anxious you are, the more positive the energy you exhibit in life. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone is capable of enlightenment. The only thing that obstructs progress toward this goal is our own tension and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded through the love of Mahayana Buddhism and many techniques derived from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path to great love.
Kundalini Yoga awakens the Kundalini energy (the energy of awakening) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga, which involves visualizing various deities, purifying energy channels, unblocking chakras, and generating a consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, prompting cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. As the war ended, conflicts in systems, processes, and culture between the two countries led to disharmony.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies have now become enemies, and the Cold War has officially begun.
It will continue for the next forty years and will be waged by proxy armies in real wars on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat along the Romanian bridgehead and regroup.
However, these plans became almost obsolete overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army violated the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties to invade the eastern regions of Poland, entering and establishing the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using shipping is currently the most effective method for transporting large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
The traditional duty of the navy is to ensure your country has the ability to transport its people and goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to transport his people and goods.
One of the most notable modern examples is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. The United States attempted to cross the Atlantic to send manpower and supplies to assist the United Kingdom.
At the same time, the German navy primarily used U-boats to try to stop transportation.
If the Allies fail, Germany might conquer Britain, just like they previously conquered other European nations.
The goat was first domesticated about ten thousand years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
The domesticated goats are usually herded in groups on mountains or other pasture areas, taken care of by shepherds who are typically children or teenagers, similar to the shepherds we are more familiar with. These herding methods are still in use today.
England built carriageways as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriageways were made only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to move faster and pull heavier loads compared to the slightly more uneven roads of the time.
In the very early days, sleepers were used to fix the tracks. However, gradually, people found that adding a small amount of iron on the track surface was more effective.
This evolved into a common practice, but iron would cause greater wear on the wooden wheels of carts.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels and all-iron rails were first introduced in 1767.
The earliest known means of transportation was walking, and with the appearance of Homo erectus (referring to upright humans), humans began walking upright two million years ago.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
Bipedal adaptations were found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus tchadensis might have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can participate in environmental movements, and even become activists to some extent, reducing harm to the future.
This is like prescribing the right remedy for many situations. However, if we do not just want to address the problem temporarily, then we should find the root cause of the problem and eliminate it at its source.
Clearly, as human technology and techniques advance rapidly, the world has been completely changed. Due to overpopulation and humans' excessively extravagant lifestyles, the problems have become more severe.
After the Congress passed the bill on July 4th, the handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, located several blocks away.
Produced 150 to 200 copies throughout the night, now known as the "Dunlap Broadside".
The document was first publicly read by John Nixon in the front yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and he read it aloud to his troops in New York on July 9. Another copy was sent to London on August 10.
The 25 known Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving versions of the document, while the original handwritten ones no longer exist.
Nowadays, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs has survived to the present day. We call them birds.
Because they have feathers and can fly, many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs.
However, there are still many things about birds that are similar to dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, they lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
In modern times, almost all computers in use are based on the manipulation of information, and the encoding of information is in the form of binary numbers.
A binary digit can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits in computer terminology.
Poisoning of the internal organs might not show immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are very common and cannot be used for immediate diagnosis.
The most obvious sign of poisoning in the body may be the presence of opened medicine containers or toxic household chemicals left at the scene.
Check the label of the specific poison to obtain the designated first aid instructions.
The word "insect" used by entomologists, in the formal sense, refers to this group of insects.
This term originates from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are very well adapted to parasitizing humans.
Assassin bugs and bedbugs are both nidicolous animals, accustomed to living in the nests or homes of their hosts.
Throughout the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disorder among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple might think that raising a baby is not in their best interest or in the best interest of the child.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their children.
During the adoption process, the biological parents terminate their parental rights to allow another couple to become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through scientific methods. In fact, this approach indeed guides most scientific research.
Conducting experiments is not the only method; an experiment is a test to rule out one or more feasible hypotheses, and raising questions and making observations can also guide scientific research.
Natural historians and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters (including psychology) are widely recognized.
As Greek knowledge declined, the Western world diverged from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
The rhythms observed in many physiological and behavioral aspects usually depend primarily on the presence of endogenous cycles and their operation through the biological clock.
Cyclical rhythms are not only responses to external periodic cues, but are also recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator, which will continue to have a free-running cycle for a period of time even without external cues.
Hershey and Chase's experiment is one of the important proposals suggesting that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, one marking the DNA in bacteriophages with radioactive phosphorus, and the other marking the protein in bacteriophages with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells, mutations can have a variety of different impacts.
Only variations in the germ cell lineage can be inherited by children, while other variations may lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism allows the appreciation of scenery, including wildlife, and is very attractive to nature enthusiasts.
On-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits, and studying information related to ecosystems.
One example is visiting, photographing, and getting to know the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive away from the small town to their workplaces and brush past those whose work destination is exactly the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is, to some extent, connected to and supporting the transportation system with private cars.
Contemporary science indicates that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere away from one of its stable states, which has been the foundation of human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in social activities and uses the transportation system, almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
You rarely hear complaints about water quality or bridge collapses of a similar degree in developed countries.
Why does the transportation system cause complaints? Why does it break down every day? Are the transportation engineers so incompetent, or is it due to some more fundamental issues?
The study of traffic flow concerns the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, traffic flow studies are not easy because we cannot predict drivers' behavior with 100% accuracy.
Luckily, the driver's behavior tends to fall within a reasonable and stable range; therefore, traffic flow tends to exhibit a certain reasonable consistency and can be approximately expressed mathematically.
To better express traffic flow, the relationships between three main characteristics are established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the sky. Their ability to fly helps them evade predators more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings backward along their bodies.
This allows them to hide in more confined spaces to avoid predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward are dragonflies and flies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people believe he is right, but many think the opposite is true: the solar system (including the sun, and even other celestial bodies) revolves around the Earth.
Seems reasonable, after all, it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. Its volume of water is more than 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
20 percent of the water that flows from rivers to the ocean on Earth comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It gathers the waters of thousands of small rivers.
Even though the construction of pyramids with stones continued until the end of the Old Kingdom period, the scale and advanced construction techniques of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments from the previous period, which had a history of over a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is about eight hundred people. It is the smallest independent country in the world by both area and population.
The official language for laws and official communication of Vatican City is Italian.
The everyday language used by most people working in that country is Italian, while Latin is more commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens within Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they could all be found in nature in their native form and were relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These four elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (arranged in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. But his theory also points out that the different forms of these elements will transform into new substances, forming the things we see before us.
Alloys are basically mixtures composed of two or more metals. Don't forget there are many more elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are regarded as metals. Of course, there are other metals as well, such as silver and gold.
There are also some alloys that contain small amounts of non-metal elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are extremely small, so small that the period at the end of this sentence can accommodate trillions of atoms.
Therefore, when the pencil was launched, many people saw it as a good friend.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of newer writing methods, the status and frequency of use of pencils have declined.
People now type messages on computer screens and no longer need pencil sharpeners.
People can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when newer things appear.
English sentence: The operating principle of a fission bomb is that combining nuclei with many protons and neutrons requires energy.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the nucleus again, and releasing some energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that even with slight vibrations or no vibrations, they tend to separate.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 kilometers thick on the front and 100 kilometers thick on the back.
The Earth's crust beneath the lunar seas is thinner, while it is thicker beneath the highlands.
Due to the thinner crust, the near side may have more lunar seas, allowing lava to more easily rise to the surface.
The content theory focuses on finding out the reasons why humans do certain things or what sparks their interest.
These theories propose that certain needs and/or desires become internalized during the process of growing into adulthood.
These theories explore what it means when certain people have the desire to do certain things, and what factors in their environment influence them to do or not do certain things.
Two well-known content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when a manager begins to lead former peers, two types of behavior may emerge. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of them."
Managers of this type have difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, assessing performance, assigning job responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum is the manager who becomes a completely different person, believing it is necessary to change everything constant in the team and take full responsibility themselves.
After all, the leader must ultimately take responsibility for the team's success or failure.
This behavior can sometimes lead to disagreements between the leader and other team members.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are still slight differences between the two.
The function of virtual team members is often to serve as the point of contact for their direct physical group.
Due to the fact that their team can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by local management, they often have greater autonomy than traditional team members.
The true existence of an "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why are organizations willing to spend time building themselves into learning organizations? One of the objectives of practicing the concept of organizational learning is innovation.
When all available resources are fully utilized by the functional departments within the organization, creativity and uniqueness will be elevated.
Ultimately, the process of internal cooperation within the organization to overcome difficulties can lead to an innovative process that meets the needs of serving customers.
Before innovating an organization, leaders must establish a culture of innovation and promote the sharing of knowledge and organizational learning.
Angie (2006) explained that the continuity method is used to help organizations improve performance.
The data of neurobiology provides physical evidence for the theoretical approaches of cognitive research, thus narrowing its research scope and making it more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior confirmed the scientists' research.
A long time ago, people already knew that different types of brain injuries, traumas, damages, and tumors could affect behavior and lead to changes in certain psychological functions.
The rise of new technology allows us to observe and study previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This provides a lot of information and materials, allowing us to build a simulated model to help us understand the functioning of the brain.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction connotation, it still constitutes a very important branch of computer science, dealing with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptability.
Research on artificial intelligence involves automating tasks that require intelligent behavior in machines.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnostics and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and facial recognition.
The above items have now become independent fields, focusing on providing solutions to problems encountered in real life.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, and have already been integrated into software applications for some home computers and electronic games.
Field trips are an important part of all teaching. Teachers often want to take students to places that buses cannot directly reach for the trips.
Technology offers virtual field trip solutions. Students can sit comfortably in the classroom to visit museum artifacts, explore aquariums, or admire beautiful artworks.
Virtual field trips are also a good way to reflect on excursions and share experiences in future teaching.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital, which is updated annually, but previous versions are also kept online as a memento.
Blogging can also improve students' writing skills. When students first start writing blogs, they usually have careless grammatical and spelling mistakes, but the presence of readers generally changes this.
Due to students usually being the most critical audience, the blog author will begin to work hard to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
In addition, the blog "enhancing students' understanding of their surroundings" satisfies readers' interest by inspiring students to become smarter and more interesting (Toto, 2004).
A blog is a tool to inspire students' cooperation outside of school and encourage students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can enhance students' analytical skills and critical thinking; by actively responding to internet materials, students can define their own positions based on the meanings of others' articles, and outline their views on specific issues" (Olavek, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, featuring a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south is Niagara Falls, while to the north are the undeveloped natural landscapes like the Muskoka River.
All of this further highlights Ontario and is considered by outsiders to be a typical Canadian place.
Most of the northern areas are sparsely populated, with some even being uninhabited wilderness.
This is a surprising population comparison: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest continent so far and also a habitat for wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent countries or associated with France, and are also known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this land and carried out large-scale occupation in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism dates back to the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route from Europe to India via the Cape of Good Hope.
The northern region is surrounded by the Sahara, while the south and west are surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female travelers, regardless of marital status, say that they are married.
Wearing a ring helps too (just don't make it look too expensive).
Women should understand that certain cultural differences might lead to being perceived as harassment, such as being followed or having one's arm grabbed, which are quite common.
When rejecting a man, you must be firm in your attitude and not afraid to express your stance (cultural differences are not an excuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was established by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinids, under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it as the House of Braganza, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar al-Baida, where Spanish traders established a trading post and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
It's easy to find places near the old Medina selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and various trinkets, but they are all targeted at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is located at the easternmost part, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano. The volcanic lava buried most of the town's streets, especially the town center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, research should be conducted before visiting any place outside of Goma to understand the ongoing fighting situation in North Kivu province.
This city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, and it offers the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking service in Africa.
You can take a Bodaboda motorcycle taxi to tour Goma. The normal (local) price for a short trip is about 500 Congolese Francs.
Combined with its relatively difficult accessibility, “Timbuktu” has become a metaphor for something exotic and faraway.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, but its historical fame has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, due to the attack of desert winds and sand, this place was listed as an endangered World Heritage site.
The PBS special "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates Jr. lists this place as one of the major stops.
This city contrasts sharply with other cities in the country, as it has a more Arabic flair compared to African cities.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into fourteen different ecological zones, each providing a habitat for different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the flagship park of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and park entry fees.
If you buy a Wild Card, there are also benefits; it allows you to enter designated South African parks or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is synonymous with Hong Kong and is also the focal destination for many tourists.
The numerous skyscrapers that make up Hong Kong's skyline resemble a shimmering bar chart, appearing especially striking against the waters of Victoria Harbour.
If you want to enjoy the most beautiful scenery of Hong Kong, leave Hong Kong Island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite shore.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed land on the northern shore.
This place was once occupied by British colonizers, making it a good starting point for finding evidence of colonial history on this territory.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland from the coast to Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The forest located in India is known as Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests here are not just mangrove swamps; they also include the last remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Ganges plains.
The area of the Sudaneta is 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is water/swamp area.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the section bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most of them are concentrated between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang.
Due to inter-regional buses often being fully booked, it is recommended to purchase tickets several days in advance.
Most areas are serviced by small Japanese Coaster buses, offering comfort and stability.
Riding a shared taxi is a quick and comfortable way to reach nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French Guianese city of Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock.
The twin towers are 83 meters tall, and the bridge is 378 meters long, with two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. It was completed in August 2011 and did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017 when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is completed.
The Guarani people live in present-day eastern Paraguay and are the largest indigenous group in the area. They lead a semi-nomadic hunter lifestyle and also practice subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua. They live by hunting, gathering food, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Province of the Giant Indians," was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous people.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has successfully retained many of its indigenous features and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The grandest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo grounds in La Canitas.
The rest of the year, you can also watch smaller tournaments and competitions.
Regarding match information and locations to purchase polo match tickets, please refer to the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is set at a value equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Currency can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located opposite the FIC West store in Stanley.
You can use pounds anywhere on the island, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are usually accepted.
Credit cards are generally not accepted on the outlying islands, but British and American currency may be accepted; it is advisable to confirm acceptable payment methods with the shop owner in advance.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so be sure to exchange your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there during the winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures exceeding thirty degrees Celsius are very common.
In winter, one might mistakenly think it's very cold; the temperature rarely drops below zero, but with the wind and humidity, it feels colder than the temperature on the thermometer.
There is no specific "rainy season" and "dry season" there: the annual rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park have become accustomed to seeing humans, these wild animals still retain their wild nature and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park regulations, you must maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards/meters from other wildlife!
No matter how gentle their appearance may seem, bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can potentially attack humans.
Each year, dozens of tourists are injured because they fail to maintain a proper distance from the animals. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so please keep your distance from them.
In addition, be aware that smells can attract bears or other wildlife, so please avoid bringing or cooking strongly scented foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu, with a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was once the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven vessels from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom all refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the struggle for independence in the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the town led to the death of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to Auckland spanning two harbors, there are many beaches in this area. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
North Shore Beach (Beigang District) is located on the Pacific Ocean, extending from Changwan in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of the beaches here are suitable for swimming, and most are planted with New Zealand Christmas trees to provide shade.
Tamaki Drive beach is in the Waitemata Harbour, located between Mission Bay in central Auckland and the affluent suburb of St Heliers.
This place is very popular with family swimmers and can be quite crowded at times, with many shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The local main beer is "Number One." It's not a complex beer, but it feels pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta."
You can buy a lot of French wine here, but the ones from New Zealand and Australia might have been shipped better.
The local tap water is very safe to drink. However, if you're worried, bottled water is also easy to find.
For Australians, "white" coffee is a foreign concept. A short black coffee is "espresso," a cappuccino has a high amount of cream (not milk froth), and tea is without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although fruit juice is expensive, the quality is excellent.
Throughout the year, many people visit the coral reefs. However, injuries due to any of the aforementioned reasons are quite rare on the coral reefs.
Despite this, it is still necessary to follow the authorities' advice, adhere to all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
From October to April in 1770, box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths. Outside of this period, they can occasionally be found.
Sharks do indeed exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away on their own.
Saltwater crocodiles do not primarily live in the ocean. Their main habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance allows travelers to have a place to stay as soon as they arrive at their destination, giving them peace of mind.
Travel agencies usually have partnerships with certain hotels, but you can also book other forms of accommodation such as campsites through the travel agency.
The travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers, and even combinations of flights and hotels.
If you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for the destination (such as a visa), they can also hold the reservation for you.
Any modifications or requests should be made through the travel agency first, rather than directly with the hotel.
At some music festivals, most of the attendees choose to camp on-site and they believe it's an essential part of the festival experience.
If you want to get closer to the event site, you should arrive early and find a camping spot close to the music.
Remember, although the music on the main stage may have already ended, some parts of the music festival might still be playing music late into the night.
Some music festivals set up special camping areas for families with children.
If traveling across the northern Baltic Sea in winter, it's necessary to check the location of the cabin, as the cabins most affected during the crossing of the icy sea will have very terrible noise.
The St. Petersburg cruise includes time in the city. Cruise passengers can be exempted from visa requirements (for details, please refer to the terms).
Casinos usually try their best to make guests spend as much time and money as possible. There are typically no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment arrangements to keep the guests in a good mood and stay inside the casino.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages for free. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibilities of snow, ice, and cold temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is lower, and you cannot drive in the same manner as on regular asphalt roads.
During a blizzard, snowfall in a very short time is enough to trap you.
Visibility may be restricted due to snowfall, blowing snow, or condensation or ice formation on car windows.
On the other hand, freezing and snowy conditions are very common in many countries, and transportation is hardly ever interrupted throughout the year.
A hunting safari might be the most attractive tourist activity in Africa and is also the itinerary that many travelers look forward to the most.
The term "safari" generally refers to traveling by land to observe the amazing African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals (like elephants and giraffes) enjoy approaching cars, and you can see them clearly with standard equipment.
Sometimes lions, leopards, and cheetahs can be quite shy, making them easier to see with binoculars.
Hiking trips (also known as "jungle walks," "hunting hikes," or "walking") can include hikes that last several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other regions within Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, with the previous occasion being in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before announcing the delay, you might find yourself in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not include July 2020 (the original time for the Olympics).
The expected ticket prices for most events range from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket price being around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them become dry. Many hotels can lend you an iron and ironing board even if the room doesn’t have them.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then if you have a hairdryer, you can try using it.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (this may cause it to shrink, or in extreme cases, to scorch).
There are many different methods of water purification on the market, some of which are effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in other places it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies; if you have concerns, you might consider purchasing bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animals and pests that are not common in their hometown.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in worse cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals capable of harming or killing people by force, usually do not meet the criteria for becoming pests.
Duty-free shopping refers to purchasing tax-free goods at specific locations.
Travelers can sometimes save a lot of money in heavily taxed countries, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway between Marion Point and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving environment, often traversing the terrain of remote and isolated areas.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, please stay alert: it's mainly steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns here.
The legally mandated speed limit is significantly lower than the preceding and subsequent sections, usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour), and strictly adhering to the speed limit is more important than other matters.
However, the strange thing is that the cell phone service signal here is much stronger than many other sections along the way, such as the wilderness in Pennsylvania.
The pastries in Germany are delicious, and Bavarian pastries are similar to those of its southern neighbor Austria, offering a wide variety of styles.
Fruity pastries are very common, with apple pastries seen year-round, while cherries and plums are regulars in the summer.
Many German baked goods also include almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes paired with a cup of rich coffee are usually an excellent combination.
If you want to try some small and delicious pastries, you can try the Berlin jam rolls, which may also be called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish primarily made with herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of liquid.

Indonesia has 17,000 islands to choose from, and Indonesian food is a general term that covers a wide variety of local cuisines from across the country.
However, without further modifiers, the term tends to be interpreted as food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Nowadays, Javanese cuisine can be found everywhere in the archipelago, including a range of simply seasoned dishes. The main seasonings favored by Javanese people are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the riders, but there is also a safety risk because the rider's foot might get stuck inside.
If a jockey is thrown off the horse but one foot is caught in the stirrup and the horse runs off, they could be dragged. To minimize this risk, some safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riding boots worn by riders have heels and smooth, fairly narrow soles.
Secondly, some saddles (especially English saddles) are equipped with a safety bar that allows the rider to pull back when falling, causing the leather of the stirrup to come off the saddle.
The top climbing location in Chile, Cochamó Valley, also known as the Yosemite of South America, boasts various massive granite walls and cliffs.
The scenery of the mountain peaks leaves people in awe. Climbers from all over the world continuously develop new routes along the endless rock walls of the valley.
Alpine skiing (including skiing and snowboarding) is very popular, and it involves attaching skis or a snowboard to your feet and sliding down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is a major tourist activity, and there are many enthusiasts (sometimes also referred to as "skiing fanatics"), who plan their entire holidays around skiing at specific locations.
The concept of skiing is very ancient—cave paintings depicting skiers can be traced back to 5000 BC!
The sport of downhill skiing can be traced back to at least the 17th century. In 1861, Norwegians established the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
Although related to alpine-style ski tourism or mountaineering, most do not involve it. The latter is conducted on steep slopes and requires sturdier skis and boots.
Imagine ski trails as similar to hiking trails.
Under good conditions, your skiing range can exceed the distance you can walk. But in rare cases, you can achieve cross-country skiing speeds without having to carry a heavy backpack while skiing on well-groomed trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small in area, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to multiple countries means having to apply for multiple visas and undergo passport checks many times.
However, the operation method in terms of this aspect in the Shen Gen area is like a country.
As long as you stay within the Shengun area, usually you do not need to pass through a passport checkpoint when crossing borders.
In the same way, as long as you have a Shengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas to each Schengen member country one by one, thus saving time, money, and avoiding paperwork.
There is no unified definition of what constitutes an antique product. Some tax authorities define items with a history of over one hundred years as antiques.
The definition has regional differences; the age limit for antiques in North America and other places may be shorter than in Europe.
Handicrafts may be classified as antiques even though they are younger than mass-produced products of the same kind.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture of reindeer trade is also significant to many other professions.
Traditionally, not all Sami people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but instead made a living through fishing, hunting, and similar activities, with reindeer mainly serving as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people are engaged in modern commerce. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Although the term "Gypsy" is widely used (especially by non-Romani people), it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Romani people.
If the country you are visiting has a travel advisory issued, your travel medical insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
In addition to referring to your own government's advice, you can also refer to the advice of other governments, but their advice is often intended for their citizens.
To cite an example, an American citizen in the Middle East may face a different situation from Europeans or Arabs.
The travel advisory is merely a simple summary of the political situation in a country.
Compared to the more detailed information from other places, the suggestions presented here are rather vague, general, and overly concise.
The term "adverse weather" refers to any hazardous weather conditions that might cause damage, severe social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and come in different types, which may depend on geography, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and impacts of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, ice storms, and sandstorms, among others.
Strongly advise travelers to be aware of any risks posed by severe weather in their area, as they may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that is considered a war zone must first undergo professional training.
Searching the internet for "hostile environment courses" might provide addresses of local companies.
A course typically covers all the topics discussed here, with detailed analysis, and usually includes practical experience.
A course generally lasts 2 - 5 days, including role-playing, extensive first aid training, and some weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are very common, but those that mention war zones are few and far between.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry the valid documents needed for their return.
The willingness of governments varies when it comes to issuing passports without specifying gender (X) or updating documents to match the required name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to implement these documents also varies greatly.
After September 11, 2001, the searches at security checkpoints also became more intrusive.
Pre-operative transgender individuals should not expect to maintain their privacy and dignity when passing through scanners.
Rip currents are backflows of waves crashing onto the beach, usually occurring near reefs or similar places.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in some deeper parts, and the rapid tide toward deep water may originate from here.
Most of the deaths resulted from exhaustion caused by trying to swim against the current, which is unlikely to succeed.
Once you break free from the current, swimming back is just as easy as usual.
When you still haven't been found, try aiming for other places, but it also depends on your abilities and whether you have been noticed, because you might want to wait for rescue.
The impact of returning to the workplace comes faster than cultural shock (with a shorter honeymoon period), lasts longer, and can potentially be more serious.
Travelers who once easily adapted to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to readapt to their native culture.
When you return to your home country after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some habits from your own country's culture.
When you first go abroad, people may show patience and understanding because they know that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
People might not realize that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
For the children, the sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You can view the pyramids in the dark and admire them in silence before the performance begins.
Usually, you always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is set as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scene is displayed on the pyramid, while different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are currently claimed by several countries, and have the highest number of bases on the islands, with 16 operational bases as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which is the site of the town of Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a still-active volcanic crater has been flooded, forming a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the peninsula and is surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountain range of the peninsula merges into the plateau, then re-emerges as the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains, divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The Sentinel Range in the north boasts the highest mountain in Antarctica, named Vinson Massif, at the summit of Mount Vinson at 4,892 meters.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
Satellite phones cannot replace mobile phones under normal circumstances, because you have to be outdoors and have an unobstructed line of sight to the satellite in order to make a call.
This type of service is often used for shipping, including yachts, and expeditions with remote data and voice communication needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
For those planning a gap year, travel and learning are increasingly popular choices.
This is especially popular among high school graduates as it allows them to take a gap year before starting university without affecting their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year program abroad can actually enhance your chances of receiving higher education in your own country.
Generally speaking, attending these educational courses requires paying tuition fees.
Finland is very suitable for rowing. This "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
A yacht is not essential for touring the islands and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are sufficient to accommodate any yacht, small boats and even rowboats can provide a different kind of experience.
Rowing is a very common pastime for Finns, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
In Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, there are similar situations, but compared to other countries, Finland is very unique (for example, in the Netherlands, this number is one in forty).
Most unique Baltic cruises make longer stops in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend two whole days visiting this historic city and then return to the ship to sleep at night.
As of 2009, if you only disembark from the ship for a tour, you will not need an additional visa.
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and tours of the city are not included in the cruise price.
For people of any age and background, flying can be a frightening experience, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
This is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and dislikes many people have towards other things.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during the flight may help overcome a fear based on the unknown or lack of control.
The courier company earns rich rewards for fast delivery of items. Time is often of the essence for business documents, goods, or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own aircraft, but other routes and smaller companies have problems.
English sentence: If they use airplanes to transport goods, it may take several days to unload and clear customs on certain routes.
The fastest way is to check it in as baggage and send it out. Airlines have regulations prohibiting the transport of luggage without a passenger, and that's exactly where you come in.
The most obvious way to enjoy the privilege of flying first class or business class is to spend a significant amount of money (a better way is to have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect business class fares to be about 4 times the price of regular economy class, and first class fares to be 11 times as much!
Generally speaking, it doesn't make sense to look for deals on business class or first class seats for direct flights from place A to place B.
Due to the fact that airlines are well aware that some core passengers are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the emergence of the self-proclaimed Transnistria Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any United Nations member states.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between the two parts of Moldova have been re-established.
The main religion of Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.

The regular announcements on the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions will be announced by the automated broadcasting system in multiple languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is usually just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to interact with people in Paris is still to show your best side, like a person with "bien élevé" (good manners). This will make your visit much easier.
If you show some basic courtesy, the rude facade of Parisians will quickly disappear.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is dense with forests, mainly composed of beech, spruce, and fir trees, along with a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and various elevation levels, there is clearly a particularly diverse array of plant communities.

At the same time, men must wear knee-length pants.
This can also be borrowed from the inventory at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each use, so you might feel uncomfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
The cuisine of Mallorca is similar to that of other Mediterranean regions, based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
Pa amb Oli is a simple and popular dinner especially beloved in the summer: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns used with "Sie" must start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.

Pre-modern observatories are usually abandoned by now and preserved as museums or educational sites.
Due to the fact that light pollution was not as severe during their flourishing period as it is now, they are usually located in cities or campuses, making them more accessible than modern observatories.
Most modern research telescopes are large facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, also known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept comes from China. There, people choose to admire plum blossoms.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom party was held near the Imperial Palace, hosted by the Emperor for himself and other royal nobles.

Singapore is generally a very safe place and very easy to explore, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
However, Singapore is located a few degrees north of the equator in the "high tropical zone," where you need to get used to (often) hot weather and intense sunshine (which is less encountered when the weather is clear).

All the animals that initially came to the island arrived by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the distance from the mainland, mammals cannot travel long distances, which makes giant tortoises the main grazing animals of the Galápagos Islands.
Since humans came to the Galapagos Islands, they have brought many mammals, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience a polar night, which means the sun will not rise above the horizon.
This provides a great opportunity to view the aurora, as the sky will be in darkness 24 hours a day.
Due to the sparse population in these areas, light pollution is usually not an issue, and you can also enjoy the stars.
