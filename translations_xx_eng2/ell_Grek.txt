This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and their three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that the wings of this animal were brown on top with a light or carrot color on the underside.
The finding also provides information about the evolution of plumage in birds.
Because the wings of dinosaurs do not have a fully developed shaft, called a rachis, but do have other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development compared to the other characteristics.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used for flying but for regulating temperature or for display. Scientists argue that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen reveals adult plumage rather than chick down.
Researchers claim that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample indicates adult feathers and not those of a hatchling.

In France, elections have always been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper with the name of their chosen candidate in an envelope.
Once the employees verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The process is encoded with great strictness by the French electoral law.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be visible so that those voting and the witnesses can certify that there are no envelopes at the start of the vote and that no additional envelopes are introduced beyond those legally counted and those of the lawful voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe each part of the process. Late in the afternoon, the votes are counted by volunteers, under strict supervision, who follow specific procedures.

Director of Public Prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, announced this morning the prosecution of Huhne and Pryce.
Hyun resigned and will be replaced in the cabinet by MP Ed Davey. MP Norman Lamb is expected to take the position of Business Secretary left vacant by Davey.
Hyun and Price were scheduled to appear at the Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
The victims were Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21, who was the driver.
Edgar Beguilla suffered injuries to his hand and jaw, while Christopher Schneider ended up needing reconstructive surgery on his face.
The weapon of Giuka missed, as it was aimed at a man's head. Schneider suffers from constant pain, blindness in one eye, loss of part of the skull, and facial reconstruction with titanium.
Snyder testified via live link from a U.S. Air Force base in his homeland.
Beyond Wednesday’s event, Karpeneto also competed in two individual championship races.
Her first event was the Slalom, where she earned a "Did Not Finish" in her first run. Thirty-six out of her 116 opponents received the same result in that race.
In her other race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting skiing team with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch who finished first and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani who finished ninth.
Four skiers from the women's sitting skiing category were unable to complete their runs, while 45 out of the 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to rank in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya stated: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered her mobile and laptop.
The accused are Baba Kanjhar, Bota Kanjhar, Rabro Kanjhar, Gaza Kanjhar, and Vishnu Kanjhar.
The police chief, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, stated that the defendants appeared in court with covered faces.
Although 3 people were inside the house during the car crash, no one was injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road of the accident was temporarily closed, while the emergency services were removing the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He then went to an Addenbrooke's clinic in Cambridge.
Since then, Antekoia has been accused by the High Court of Edinburgh of the murder of her son.
He is in custody with charges and a trial pending, but any eyewitness evidence may have been influenced as her image has been widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, however, justice in Scotland operates differently, and the courts have ruled that publishing photographs is potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee states that "journalists seem to be walking a tightrope if they publish photos, etc., of the suspects."
The Prosecution, which is generally responsible for prosecutions, has informed journalists that there will be no further comments at least until charges are pressed.
According to the leaked information, the document will refer to the conflict over the borders that Palestine desires based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
According to reports, among the other issues covered was the future status of Jerusalem, which is a holy site for both states, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian authority agrees to allow this kind of presence only for five years.
The marksmen in the supplementary test for pest control would be under close supervision by the forest rangers, as the test would be monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In collaboration with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW), specialized volunteers were recruited as part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters' Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Director of Maintenance and Heritage of the Parks for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received thorough safety and training instructions.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn into a new Provisional Electoral Council (PEC) that consisted of nine members.
It is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee proposed the prior resignation of the Provisional Election Council as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Some brutal protests occurred due to the non-holding of elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Based on official reports, about 60 cases of iPod malfunctions occurred, resulting in high temperatures, starting six fire outbreaks, and leaving four people with minor fire-related injuries.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it was aware of the 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time on Friday).
The Mariana Islands emergency management office said there were no reports of damage in their territory.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A Filipino who was a former police officer took Hong Kong visitors hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of his country.
Rolando Mendoza fired, targeting the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least 6 dead have been confirmed so far.
Six of the hostages, along with the children and the elderly, were released early; so were the photographers who came from the Philippines.
The photographers later replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the toilet. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a career in medicine.
He trained and became a gynecologist, starting to work in 1959 at the state female clinic in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching pre-term birth in his free time.
According to his research, if a hormone were given, the fetal lung would mature.
Xinhua stated that on Wednesday government investigators located two flight data recorders of the "black box" type.
The fellow wrestlers paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first winner of the Queen of Extreme contest. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Unique just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as bizarre as I am... maybe more so... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
34% of those who participated in the survey agreed with this idea, because they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Regarding the two extremes of the poll, 29% of all respondents believe that Australia should become a republic without a monarchy as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic without a monarchy.
The gold Olympian was expected to participate in the 100 meters and 200 meters freestyle swimming and in three swimming relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his discomfort, his physical condition is in question.
He couldn't receive the medication he needed to prevent pain because they are banned by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number found to date on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of transporting water to Earth as well as organic matter which can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, as comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, became governor early in the year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration claims that the next-generation air transportation system would allow aircraft to conduct shorter routes, save gallons of fuel every year, and reduce carbon emissions.
The technology it uses is satellite –as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology– to allow air traffic controllers to locate an aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
There are no additional transfers, and underground trains will not stop at Wembley. Car parks and park and ride facilities are not available on the grounds.
The fears of a shortage of transportation raise the possibility that the match will be held behind closed doors, without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in Science talked about the existence of a new type of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though the process is believed to have taken much longer, due to the breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch of the genus Geospiza fortes and the migratory finch of the genus Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be molded into all shapes. It can be formed into shapes of minimal size.
It can be sculpted into thin wire, and then bent and woven. It can be forged or rolled into sheets.
It can become very thin and stick to other metals. It can become so thin that sometimes it was used as decoration in handmade book images called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using juice from red cabbage.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) of the chemical substance being examined.
Hydrogen ions are protons that no longer have their electrons (as a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Rotate the two dry powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, press them to form a ball.
The moisture on your palms will react with the outer shells, creating a peculiar sensation and forming something like a peel.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet for each house, connected to an advanced sewage system.
Also, in Greece, in the dwellings of Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, ruins of sewage systems have been found.
Toilets also appeared in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. The toilets in Rome were often part of public baths, where everyone, regardless of gender, constituted a mixed crowd.
When you call someone who is far away, you use a satellite.
The satellite that is in space receives the call and then sends it back to Earth almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched via rocket. Experts have space telescopes because the atmosphere of our planet causes distortions in light and our visibility.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is required to send a satellite or a telescope into space.
The contribution of the wheel to the world is amazing. The most important of all is the simpler and faster movement.
Thanks to him we have trains, cars, and many other transportation machines.
Below them are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from hares to antelopes and deer.
Ultimately, there are many kitten predators (including household cats that are allowed to roam freely) that hunt the numerous insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of place, a special role that each cat has, which prevents competition among them.
Lions are the most social feline species, as they live in large groups called prides.
Herds consist of one to three adult males that are related to each other along with up to thirty females with their young.
Females usually have a close connection with each other, as they form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act in much the same way as wolf or dog packs, animals that are remarkably similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and are also extremely deadly to their prey.
The tiger, as a complete athlete, can climb (not very well), swim, make huge leaps, and exert five times more force than a strong human to lift something.
The tiger belongs to the same category (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion, but rather resembles a phrase of angry, shouted words.
Ocelots prefer small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and even birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to hunt through their sense of smell, sniffing the ground to determine their location.
They see very well in the dark through night vision and move silently. Ocelots hunt their prey by adapting to their environment and then suddenly attacking their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return) they will often encounter a different environment than in the past.
This new environment features new resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what was required in the past.
The indigenous inhabitants have not changed at all; the same adjustments need to be made as in the past.
As time goes on, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, the similarity with the rest of the population continually decreases.
At some point, after thousands or perhaps millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, release with breathing).
The plants create their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
The houses and our clothes are made from plants. The foods we eat are mostly plants. Without plants, the survival of animals would be impossible.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything except other Mosasauruses.
His long jaws had over 70 razor-sharp teeth combined with an additional set of teeth at the top of his mouth, indicating that there was no escape for anything that crossed his path.
We do not know for sure, but it might have had a forked tongue. It fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might have been a cannibal.
It launched attacks on anything that entered the water. Even the giant dinosaur, the Tyrannosaurus, would not be a match for it.
Although most of their foods would be familiar to us, the Romans also had various strange or unusual festive dishes, including the following: wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
Another difference is that the poor and women ate their food sitting on chairs, while wealthy men preferred to eat at banquets where they could recline on their side while dining.
The meals in ancient Rome could not have included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, there was no corn, tomato, potato, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever eaten turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the residence of the god.
The people would dedicate sacrifices to the deities, and the priesthood would attempt to fulfill the deities' desires by organizing mysteries and celebrations.
In every temple, there is an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary which only priests can access.
Sometimes, specific towers were built in a pyramid shape called ziggurats, and they were part of the temples.
The top of the tower served as a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the roof was not so important.
The Jewish family spent the majority of their lives outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard while the shops were open stalls facing the street. Stone was used as a building material.
The land of Canaan did not have large forested areas, therefore wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian saga, it is mentioned that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he found Greenland and gave it that name.
However, despite his discovery, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian," the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differed greatly.
If you have watched the movie National Treasure, you might believe that on the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence there is a treasure map written.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the following was written: "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." This is inscribed below, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that from the beginning the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, the note might have been added simply as a remark.
The landing in Normandy and the subsequent battles liberated the French North, but the South was still not free.
It was governed by the Vichy Government. It consisted of French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; this raid was called Operation "Dragon."
Within two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and next in line was Germany.
Culture is a unique tradition shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization (πολιτισμός) comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil (πολιτικός), which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this indeed somewhat describes the size of society.
City-states are the ancestors of nations. A cultural ethos involves the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, in a continuous cultural footprint and an exquisite diffusion.
Often, smaller civilizations are lost without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially created a weak central government - with Congress being the only component - based on the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, which were uncooperative, for the enforcement of all laws.
Additionally, he had no jurisdiction to overlook the tax legislation and tariffs between the states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, but the states took the government so lightly that often their representatives were absent.
The national football teams of Italy and Germany are the second most successful teams worldwide and were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the countries of the North, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic Games events.
In Japan, there are almost 7,000 islands (the largest one is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, it is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective.
The beginning of Taiwan is lost in the past, in the 15th century, where passing European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan and initiated a transformation in the practices by which the native grains were produced, employing Chinese workers on the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern parts of Taiwan, making it an administrative region of their empire in 1885.
After losing in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty then signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, where Taiwan was ceded to the Japanese until 1945.
The Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, specifically the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings in the complex have been built from scratch in order to give tourists a better idea of what their original appearance was like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and its restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common form of still image photography is 35 mm worldwide, which was the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is produced up to today, but the most important thing is the aspect ratio that has been inherited from the forms of image sensors of the digital camera.
The 35mm format is actually 36mm wide, which causes confusion, and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this arrangement (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest ratio of whole numbers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common forms (the category of APS forms, for example) are equal to or closely approximate these image ratios.
The rule of three, often subject to abuse and mockery, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while simultaneously maintaining order to a degree in an image.
It states that the most effective point for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which now possessed wealth and power, was subjected to scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has established unbreakable bonds among the European states despite any differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power influenced everyone, from kings to common mortals.
One of the main beliefs of Christianity is that wealth should be used to relieve the poor and those who suffer, and the churches' funds are specifically collected for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether the doctrine was being implemented correctly.
The United Kingdom began to blockade Germany by sea immediately after the start of the attacks.
The strategy was effective, as cuts were made to vital military and political supplies, even though the blockade in question violated generally accepted international law, which has been codified by various international agreements of the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom placed mines in international waters with the aim of hindering the movement of ships in every part of the sea, even threatening neutral ships.
Since there was limited reaction to this tactic, Germany anticipated the same for its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was peace and isolation.
The states, having witnessed the horror and atrocities of war during World War I, wanted to avoid a repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take up a job at the Edison company.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing each distinct time period. Each stage of China or each ruling family constituted a separate dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable era of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was that of the Three Kingdoms, which prevailed for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those times, a fierce war raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, as thousands of people lost their lives fighting for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
The social and political consequences are numerous, including the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to democratization, patriotism, and the belief that the country does not belong to a single ruler, but to all the people.
Additionally, after the Revolution, professions became accessible to all male job applicants, providing the opportunity for the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applied to the army, as instead of enlisting based on category, it was now done based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed individuals of the working classes from other countries to start their own revolution.
Mohammed was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the "Nur" (light) mountain for reflection.
The cave itself, where it survived through time, provides a very vivid image of the spiritual inclination of Muhammad.
The cave is far from the world as it is located on the edge of a hill north of Mecca.
In reality, it is not easy at all for someone to find it even if they know of its existence. Once you enter the cave, you are in complete isolation.
Nothing is visible beyond the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very few things of this world are visible or can be heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, which was built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many large pyramid-shaped structures constructed in honor of the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Necropolis of Giza" located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, features various pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), several small tombs, numerous temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was constructed in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, as well as the smaller tombs and temples, were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family members.
The symbol indicating that the bow should move upwards looks like a V, and the symbol indicating downward movement resembles a staple wire or a square that lacks its bottom side.
Playing up-bow means that you should start from the tip, pushing the bow, and playing down-bow means that you should start from the frog (the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull it.
The upward movement of the bow produces a softer sound, while the downward movement is stronger and more dynamic.
You are free to put your own marks, but keep in mind that those that exist perform some musical function, so they often need to be taken into account.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of market women forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (eleven-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, who were all terrified, to return from Versailles to Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people who were screaming and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At some point, a person from the crowd began to brandish the head of a member of the royal guard who was killed at Versailles, in front of the terrified queen's eyes.
The expenses of the imperialistic war of the United States for the conquest of the Philippines were provided by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the USA to cover a large portion of the expenses, and the interest rate of the bonds was motivated on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking institutions.
Certainly, the excess profits arising from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people were to be the main profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must perceive the context that led to the formation of the order.
The period when the events occurred is often referred to as the Late Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which by conditions ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, from the promotion or imposition of technology to the strict interpretation that humanity's future is governed by an underlying logic directly linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two central ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely away from cultural and political influence and that technology, in turn, exerts "influence" on societies of an inherent nature, rather than on societies adapted to the present day.
For example, one might argue that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a small number of vehicles, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The regime of mass ownership also leads to higher rates of traffic accidents, which in turn lead to new methods in healthcare for the rehabilitation of physical injuries.
Romanticism possessed an important element of cultural determinism, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the framework of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time customs and cultural elements emerged in conjunction with this geography, which, being in harmony with the position of society, were better than laws arbitrarily imposed.
Just as Paris is considered the source of style in the modern era, so was Constantinople the corresponding European source during feudal times.
His reputation as the center of abundance began to spread around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its prestige declined in the twelfth century, mainly due to the Crusaders who brought back materials such as silk and spices, which were of higher value than the products of the Byzantine markets.
It was then that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as in the 14th century.
In the beginning, the dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, the slow channels of communication entailed delays of 25 to 30 years in style in the West.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the era, which resulted from the Crusades, was that people started fastening their clothes with buttons.
Conservation agriculture is the type of farming that takes place to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, usually organic system of using stored seeds sourced from the local ecosystem, combined with crop rotations or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Traditionally, the majority of farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this still happens in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite individuals with similar views, who feel marginalized by social norms, giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are divided based on how old the member is, where they come from, their social class, where they are located, and/or racial discrimination.
The characteristics of a subculture that make it distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
To signify their identity, members of a subculture often adopt a characteristic and symbolic style, which includes various fashions, particular behaviors, and slang.
Main technique for the meaning of socialization is to rely on the minimally unfortunate incidents of children who, due to negligence, misfortune, or mistreatment, did not interact with adults during their lifetime.
Such children are called "wildlings" or wild. Some wild children have been isolated by people, usually by their own parents. In some cases, this abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection because of the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Wild children are likely to have experienced severe abuse or traumatic experiences before being abandoned or running away.
For some, it is said that they were raised by animals; for others, it is speculated that they have lived alone in the wild.
A wild child, when it has been raised entirely by animals without any contact with humans, exhibits behaviors (within natural limits) that almost completely resemble those of the specific animal that cared for it, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based teaching makes learning easier and more interesting, aids take it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a way of learning but more of a helping hand to people undergoing a new teaching experience, such as learning a new computer program or starting a new project.
There are virtual and real scaffolds, in other words, the teacher constitutes a form of scaffold, but the same applies to the Microsoft Office paperclip character.
Virtual aids are integrated into the software and are intended to ask, promote, and explain the processes whose handling may have been very difficult for students.
Children are placed in the care of foster parents for various reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment without care, love, and education, yet it happens.
We perceive the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
The foster care system we have is considered to provide safe homes, caring individuals who offer care, stable education, and reliable medical care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that the child was not receiving in the home from which they were removed.
The internet includes elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet result in additional dimensions with regard to the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are considered important motives for someone to use the internet (James et al., 1995).
The "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) in their research on audience reactions to websites.
The videotaping helped in significant findings in understanding microexpressions, that is, our expressions that last for a very brief moment.
Specifically, it is said that one can perceive if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks in his dissertation titled "The President's Speech" mentions that individuals who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to discern sincerity accurately.
It is further considered that these abilities in understanding human behavior are present in animals such as domestic dogs.
A twentieth-century study showed that there are two forms of genetic diversity, latent and expressed.
The mutation adds new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
The distinction and mixing redistribute the diversity between the two sides in each family.
Outside in the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to satisfy its need for amino acids from the available plant resources.
Moreover, their failure in the specific task had serious consequences: reduced growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would be the proteins that can adhere to leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest by primate mammals like us, unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, the feed (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they are also significant sources of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Taking all the facts into account, it is not surprising that our ancestors faced the "protein issue" as chimpanzees do on the savannah at this moment.
The interruption of sleep is the process by which you consciously wake up during the normal period of your sleep and fall asleep again after a while (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you regain your senses without fully waking up.
If you catch yourself turning off the alarm clock while you're asleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, so you need to get up to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm include consuming plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties) before bedtime, so that one is forced to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the intensity in their body and spirit.
The less the pressure, the better the vital force that is present. Each person has the potential to find ultimate serenity and pleasure.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacles to this goal are each individual's tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism, in principle, is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that embraces everything.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightening) awakens due to movements, breathing practices, mantras, and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, conflicts on the level of systems, processes, and culture led the two countries to a rupture.
As two years had passed since the war ended, the former allies were now enemies, and the beginning of the Cold War had occurred.
It would last for 40 years and involve proxy wars, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other regions.
By September 17, 1939, the defense of Poland had already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans ceased to be beneficial almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian front and the Ukrainian front, after invading the eastern territories of Poland, violating the Peace Treaty of Riga, the non-aggression Pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is by far the most efficient way for the transoceanic movement of large parts of the population and merchandise.
The work of sailors has long aimed to ensure that your country can transport your people and goods, while also preventing your enemy from transporting theirs and their goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples was the campaign in the North Atlantic during World War II. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was attempting to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies failed, the Germans would probably be able to conquer Britain as they did with the rest of Europe.
Goats were likely domesticated for the first time in the Zagros Mountains of Iran 10,000 years ago.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed on hills or other pastures, often tended by goatherds who were usually children or teenagers, equivalent to the more commonly known shepherds. These methods of breeding are still used today.
Wooden railways were being built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wooden rails consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to achieve higher speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
Wooden railway fasteners appeared quite early and were intended to hold the railroad tracks in place. Gradually, however, it became apparent that the tracks would be much more functional with an iron support on top.
Such a method was common, but the iron caused more damage to the wheels of the wooden wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first railway tracks made entirely of iron appeared.
The first known means of transportation was walking; humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright as is customary.
Elements of bipedal movement have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We have the ability to lead a more sustainable life, to become part of the environmental movement, and perhaps to act activist-wise in order to somehow mitigate the problems of the future.
It's like dealing with symptoms in many cases. However, if we do not wish for a temporary solution, we will need to discover the source of the issues and neutralize them.
It is quite apparent that the world has changed greatly due to humanity's scientific and technological achievements, and that problems have increased due to overpopulation and wasteful lifestyles.
After its approval by Congress on July 4, the handwritten note signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away, to the printing office of John Dunlap.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were printed, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon on July 8th outside the Independence Hall.
A copy was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. Another arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that we know still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a species of dinosaur has survived to the present day. They are referring to birds.
They are not considered to be in the category of dinosaurs by many because they have feathers and possess the ability to fly.
However, many things about birds make them resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two legs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Computers are now based on the management of information that is encoded with a binary system.
To use computer terminology, a binary number can only take one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are quite general, making an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The most reliable sign that someone has been internally poisoned is an open bottle of medicine or some toxic household chemical in the area.
Read the label for special first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "koreos" is officially used by etymologists for this group of insects.
This term originates from the familiarity of the ancients with bedbugs, which were insects that easily adapted to parasitize humans.
The assassin bug and the bedbug are nidicolous, adapted to live in the nest or shell of their host.
In the United States of America, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, making it the main neurological condition among the young and middle-aged.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, of which the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve are parts.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis compared to men.
Two partners may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of the child they have.
These couples can plan an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method essentially directs most scientific research.
However, experimentation does not exist on its own, and specifically the experiment is a test conducted to refute one or more possible hypotheses; questioning and observation also direct scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and specifically on the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on scientific matters, including psychology, were widely accepted.
As Greek intellectualism lost ground, the West became severed from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that often the rhythms noted in physiology and behavior depend on the existence of endogenous cycles, as well as their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that perpetually continue their cyclic function even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main demonstrations that DNA is genetic material.
The Hersey and Chase took phages, or microbes, to insert their genetic material into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled either the DNA in the phage using radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein using radioactive sulfur.
Mutations may lead to a wide variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the role of the segment of genetic material it affects, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ line cells can be inherited by offspring, as mutations in other cells may cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are looking for natural landscapes to enjoy nature, along with the area's wild flora and fauna.
Examples of activities in a given location include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as studying information concerning the ecosystem.
For example, some visit, photograph, and learn about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their workplace and meet with others whose work destination is the place the former just left.
In dynamic shuttle transport, everyone is connected in some way and supports a transport system based on private vehicles.
Today, science shows that this vast carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of a stable state that has supported the evolution of the human species over the last two million years.
Every person participates in society and uses some transportation system. And almost everyone expresses complaints about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges are rarely heard at the same level.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental to blame?
Traffic Flow is the analysis of the traffic of specific drivers and cars between two places and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is not easy, as it is impossible to predict drivers' behavior with complete certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a range of reasonable consistency; thus, traffic flows tend to have some logical consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established among the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assisted in the preparation, design, and operations of road network facilities.
The first animals to take flight were insects. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies backwards.
This provides them with a greater variety of small hiding places from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Many years ago, Aristarchus stated that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some believed he was right, but many thought the opposite, that is, that the Solar System moved around the Earth and the Sun (even around other stars).
It seems logical, since the Earth doesn't seem like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest overall river on the planet. It carries more than 8 times the amount of water compared to the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the river with the greatest width worldwide, sometimes reaching 6 miles.
20% of the water discharged by the Earth's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It gathers water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the pyramids of Giza in size and technical perfection in construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were impressed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The residents of Vatican City number approximately 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses the Italian language in its legislation and official announcements.
The Italian language is also used in everyday life by most people working for the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
The man knew of the existence of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as all of these can be found in nature in raw form and their extraction with primitive tools is relatively easy.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is created from the mixture of one or more of the four elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
Mainly it seemed like the four forms of matter (in this sequence): solid, liquid, air, and plasma, although he assumed they still transformed into new substances in order to form this presence.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many chemical elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. There are, of course, other metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include small amounts of non-metal elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of very small particles, the atoms.
The size of atoms is so extremely small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil, when it appeared, became a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods emerge, the position and usefulness of the pencil have been downgraded.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever needing to use a pencil sharpener.
One might wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer appears.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like a heavy cart rolling down a hill. Breaking the core again releases some of that energy.
Some individuals have unstable nuclei, and this leads them to disintegration if they are subjected to little or even no pressure.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner beneath the seas and thicker beneath the highlands.
There might be more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. The lava could more easily reach the surface this way.
Content theories focus on discovering what makes people click or what attracts them.
These theories argue that individuals have certain needs and/or desires which have been internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
These theories study what makes certain people want what they want and what exists in their environment that will lead them to do or not do specific things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general terms, two behaviors can occur when managers begin to supervise their former peers. One end of the spectrum is to try to remain as "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary actions, conduct evaluations, assign responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one can transform into an unrecognizable person who feels that they must change everything the group has done and take credit for it.
After all, the one ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure is the captain.
This behavior often leads to a rift between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are created with the same principles of integrity as conventional teams, although there are small differences.
The virtual team members often serve as a link to their immediate physical team.
Often, they are more autonomous than conventional team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones, which may not be acceptable to their local management.
The existence of an "invisible team" truth (Larson and La Fasto, 1989, p. 109) is yet another unique feature of a virtual team.
Everyone is introduced to the "invisible team" of management. This team sets out the requirements for all participants.
Why would an organization want to go through this time-consuming process of establishing capability learning? One of the goals of practically applying the concepts of capability learning is innovation.
Creativity and intelligence are favored when appropriate use is made of all available resources in the operational units of an organization.
As a result, the process within which an organization collaborates to overcome an obstacle can lead to new and innovative processes in favor of meeting customer needs.
For an organization to be innovative, management must create an environment of innovation, knowledge exchange, and organizational learning.
The explanation given by Angel (2006) for the approach of continuous learning describes it as a method used to help organizations increase their level of performance.
Neurobiological evidence offers tangible proof for a theoretical study of cognition. Therefore, it limits the breadth of the research by making it clearer.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is an aid for researchers and their study.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and may cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that humans have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to create simulation models that will help us understand the processes happening in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence largely alludes to science fiction, it is nonetheless an important branch of computer science that deals with the adaptation of behavior, learning, and intelligence in a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence involves the construction of machines with the aim of automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
The examples include control, programming, responses to customer diagnostics and inquiries, as well as handwriting recognition, speech recognition, and facial recognition.
These are now separate entities, which focus on providing solutions to real everyday problems.
The AI system nowadays often operates in the fields of finance, healthcare, engineering, and the military, and it is also inherent in various home computer software applications and cyberspace games.
Field trips are an important element of every class. Very often a teacher would like to go with their students to places where access by bus, however, is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual tours. Students can see museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while in their classroom.
Essentially, participating in a trip also serves as an important opportunity to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year it is updated, but the old versions are kept online and serve as an album.
Blogs can also contribute to improving a student's writing skills. While students' experiences with blogs often begin with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes this.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to make an effort to improve his writing style in order to avoid criticism.
Also, participating in blogs "forces students to become more understanding about the world around them." The need to maintain the audience's interest inspires students to become clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Managing a website is a technique that promotes teamwork and encourages students to learn things beyond what they traditionally learn at school in the morning.
The proper use of blogs "can encourage students to employ more analytical and critical thinking, as through active engagement with online material, students can establish their positions within the context of texts from other individuals, as well as express their own perceptions on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the enchanting, bilingual capital of Canada, which includes a wide range of galleries and museums showcasing both the old and modern Canada.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north is the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and even beyond.
All these and many more characterize Ontario as the quintessence of the Canadian character as it is perceived by foreigners.
Large areas in the even more northern part are quite sparsely populated, while some are almost uninhabited wilderness zones.
For a population comparison that surprises many: African Americans living in the USA are more numerous than Canadians.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and constitutes a continent of its own in terms of its wildlife species.
Almost all the islets are independent or have French origins, and are famous for providing luxurious marine sanctuaries.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them to the area, and it spread significantly to the Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonization began in the 15th century, when the explorer Vasco da Gama, who was from Portugal, found the route that circumnavigates the Cape and leads from Europe to India.
The area is bordered to the north by the Sahel, while the Atlantic encloses it on the southern and western sides of the place.
Women: It is recommended that every woman traveling declares herself married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
The women must understand that habits differing in culture can lead to actions that would be considered harassment, and it is not uncommon to approach them from behind, grab them by the hand, etc.
Be unwavering when rejecting a man and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that's no excuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was created by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and became a strategic port for the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Merinids who gave it the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Batya, while the name Casablanca was given by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is among the places that present the least interest for shopping in all of Morocco.
It's easy to find places around the old Medina that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of trinkets, but they are all touristy.
Goma is a city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with high tourist traffic in the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma suffered devastation due to the Nyiragongo volcano, whose lava covered almost all the roads of the city, primarily the center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside of Goma should be studied to understand the situation of the ongoing conflicts in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest gorilla tracking and observation programs in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. Usually, the fare (local) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
In combination with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has acquired the metaphorical meaning of an exotic, distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and it also has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage monuments because it is threatened by desert sand.
It is one of the most important stops during Henry Louis Gates's show on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) about the special Wonders of the African World.
The city differs completely from the other cities of the country, as it mainly has an Arabic atmosphere rather than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northern and eastern part of South Africa and is located along the border line of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while its southern border is considered to be the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different areas of ecological interest, each supporting different species of wildlife.
It is one of the most remarkable attractions in South Africa and is referred to as the emblem of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As with all National Parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation entry tickets for the park.
Perhaps it is beneficial for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access either to selected parks in South Africa or to all its national parks.
The island of Hong Kong is also the name of the territory of Hong Kong and is a major attraction for many visitors.
The grandeur of the buildings shaping the urban skyline of Hong Kong has been likened to a glittering bar graph highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For a better view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head across to the Kowloon waterfront.
The urban development of Hong Kong Island has mostly been densely packed on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place that British colonizers occupied and, therefore, if you are looking for traces of the area's colonial past, it is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest area in the world, extending 80 km inland in Bangladesh and India's coastal part.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps; they include some of the last remnants of the imposing jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is covered by water/swamp zones.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are about 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area today.
The buses depart from the interregional station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 7:30.
Due to the fact that the buses between regions are usually full, it is recommended to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster-type buses, which are characterized by their comfort and durability.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River, connecting the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters, a length of 378 meters, and have two corridors with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, and it remained closed to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group that inhabited the lands now known as eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called the "Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the conflict between the Spanish conquerors and the native groups.
The period of colonization, which lasted three centuries, began with the Spaniards.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its domestic character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The main annual tournament is held in the last month of the year at the Las Canitas water polo pools.
Here you can watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and ticket sales points for water polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), whose value is equal to that of the British pound sterling (GBP).
You can exchange currency at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards as well as US dollars are usually accepted.
In remote islands, credit cards are likely not to be accepted, although British and American currency might be; ask the owners in advance to ascertain which payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so be sure to exchange currency before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it has summer when the northern hemisphere is experiencing winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone. In the summer, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
The cold in winter is deceptive: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to create the sensation that it is colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to human presence, their wild nature remains untamed, which is why we should not feed or disturb them.
According to park authorities, maintain at least 100 yards/meters distance from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters distance from all other wild animals!
However calm bison, Canadian deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals may seem, they can still attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep appropriate distances. These animals are large, wild, and can become dangerous, so give them space.
Also, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking foods with strong odors and keep the camping area clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has nearly 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
At the port, a famous naval confrontation took place in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to depart from it.
All the ships sank except for one British cruiser. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the murder of the high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland has two harbors. The most popular ones are located in this area.
The beaches of the Northern Shores (in the North Harbour district) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the North to Devonport in the South.
Almost all are sandy beaches suitable for safe swimming, and most even have shade from pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in Waitemata Harbour of the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes filled with families and have a variety of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is called "Number One" and it is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
A wide variety of French wines are available for tasting, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia may be a better choice.
The local tap water is absolutely safe to drink, but if you're concerned, you can easily find bottled water.
In Australia, the idea of a flat white coffee is foreign. The short black is the espresso, the cappuccino is topped with cream and not foam, and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but amazing.
Throughout the year, many trips are carried out on the reef and injuries caused by any of these reasons on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, you follow the authorities' advice, comply with all the signs, and pay close attention to the safety warnings.
Since 1770, box jellyfish have been appearing near beaches and river mouths from October to April. Occasionally, one may encounter them at a different time of year.
Sharks do indeed exist, however, they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of them and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not inhabit the sea; their primary natural habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, travelers ensure that they will have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often make agreements with specific hotels, but you can also make reservations through an agent for other forms of accommodation like camping.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, arrangements for transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
Your application may be put on hold if you need time to reconsider the offer or to gather other documents for your trip (e.g., visa).
However, any modifications or requests should be referred to the travel agent first and not sent directly to the hotel.
Regarding certain festivals, the majority of attendees at music festivals decide to camp there, and most consider it a very important part of the experience.
If you wish to be close to the action, you should start early to find a camping spot near the music.
Remember that while the music may end at the main stages, there might be parts of the festival where the music continues late into the night.
Some festivals provide special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in the winter, check the location of your cabin, as when the ship passes through ice, terrible noises are created for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time you will stay in the city. Those boarding the ship are not required to have a visa (see the terms).
Casinos typically make a great effort to maximize the time and money visitors spend. Windows and clocks are absent, and exits are hard to find.
Many times there are special offers on food, drink, and entertainment to keep customers in a good mood and within the business premises.
In various venues, free alcoholic drinks are offered. However, intoxication affects judgment, and a good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to travel by road at high altitude or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, and very low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is not enough traction and driving is difficult compared to bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, it can snow so much that it traps you in a very short period of time.
Visibility can also be reduced due to snowfall, moisture, or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, where traffic mostly continues without interruptions throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest travel attractions in Africa and a sightseeing highlight for many visitors.
The term safari is widely used to refer to a land journey aimed at visiting the spectacular African wildlife, especially in the savanna.

Stirrups are used as a support for the rider's lower limbs and are held on the right and left side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, however, they may pose safety challenges due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If someone riding a horse falls off but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse might drag them along the road as it runs. To prevent this, some safety precautions are taken.
Initially, most riders have special shoes with heels, a soft and relatively small sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English ones, feature safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to fall from the saddle if pulled backward by the rider when falling.
Cochamó Valley - A prime climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America with a variety of big walls and granite rocks.

Backpacking with skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is related to alpine skiing and mountaineering, but usually does not include them, as the latter are done on steep terrain and require much harder skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as a similar coverage of distance by hiking.
Under ideal conditions, you will be able to cover relatively greater distances than by walking - but you will very rarely achieve the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on specially designed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, visiting many countries during a trip would require visa applications and multiple passport checks.
The Schengen Area, however, one could say, functions as a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you are generally allowed to cross borders without passing through passport control points again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the member states of the Schengen area, saving time, money, and bureaucratic procedures.
There is no universal definition by which a processed product is classified as an antique. Certain tax services define antiques as goods over 100 years old.

The security checkpoint inspections have also become much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender individuals in a pre-surgical state cannot expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Surface currents are the returning flows from waves that break on the beach, often on a reef or something similar.
Due to the underwater topology, return flows are concentrated in certain deeper sections where strong currents may form at great depths.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which is not always possible.
Once you are off the current, swimming to shore will not be more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a point where you haven't been trapped before, or, based on your skills and whether you've been detected, it might be preferable to wait to be rescued.
The shock of returning starts before the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase shortens), lasts longer, and can be more severe.

Others include Livingston and Deception Islands where the flooded crater of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the peninsula, which is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula join at this point with the plateau, and then reappear to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth mountain range, which is divided by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest elevation being the summit of Mount Vinson at 4,892 m.
In remote places where there is no telephone signal, a satellite phone might be your only option.
The satellite phone does not generally replace the mobile phone, because you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used in navigation, including leisure boats, as well as for missions that use remote data and have voice communication needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.

The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a bunch of money for the privileged seat (or even better, ask your company to do it for you).
However, this comes at a cost: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the regular economy fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
Generally, there is no reason even to look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a key category of passengers who are willing to spend a lot of money for the privilege of a quick and comfortable journey to their destination, and they charge accordingly.
