This confirms not only the widespread idea that dinosaurs had feathers, but also details that fossils cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers stated that this animal's feather color is a bright brown on top and white or orange underneath.
The discovery provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a developed rachis (a central shaft), but possessed other feather characteristics — barbs and barbules — researchers believe that the rachis is a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were used for temperature regulation or display, rather than flight. Researchers stated that although this might be a juvenile dinosaur's tail, the specimen is a collection of adult feathers, not those of a chick.
Researchers say that while this is a juvenile dinosaur tail, the specimen is a collection of adult feathers, not chicken.

Although the work done was largely supported by theory, the program was written to simulate observations from the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The impact the team was looking for is caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon has a gravitational pull on Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way has a gravitational pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located in a halo around the galaxy and is made up of many small particles.

Candidates can send representatives to observe each part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT, and the road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Next, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adeyko has been accused in Edinburgh Sheriff Court of killing her daughter since then.
She is in custody awaiting charges and evidence, but any eyewitness testimony may be inadmissible because she has been widely talked about in the community.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts view publishing photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said, "It seems that journalists are treading a dangerous line if they publish photos and other information of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is the general prosecuting authority, has said it will not comment to journalists until there is evidence of charges.
The document, based on the leaked information, refers to Palestine's border dispute, seeking borders based on those existing before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other covered topics reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to such a presence for only five years.
In the additional pest control experiment, shooters will be closely monitored by guards because the experiment is under control and its effectiveness is being evaluated.
Qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program, in partnership with NPWS and the Australian Sports Shooters Association (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Park Conservation and Heritage Director with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial cull received a comprehensive safety and training briefing.
Martelly has been sworn into a new nine-member transitional electoral council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended that the incumbent CEP (Chief Electoral Planner) resign early as part of a package of steps the country should take towards the new election.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Some violent peaceful protests arise from not holding elections, some since 2011.
Approximately 60 overheating incidents involving iPods, resulting in malfunctions, have been reported; in total, six fires have occurred, causing minor burns to four people.
Japan's Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it has identified 27 incidents related to the equipment.
Last week, METI stated that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "non-serious."
The minister responded to Apple's report of moving its data by saying it was "truly sad."
An earthquake struck Marina at 07:19 AM local time (Friday 09:19 PM GMT).
The Northern Marianas Office of Emergency Management says there are no reported injuries in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there was no tsunami threat.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Numerous hostages were able to be rescued, and so far it has been confirmed that at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as Filipino photographers, were released earlier.
Because she wanted to go to the restroom, the photographers took the old woman's place. Mendoza was killed with a gun.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and joined the medical profession.
Having trained as an obstetrician, they began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying premature labor in his spare time.
His study shows that administering hormones accelerates fetal lung maturation in infants.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow fighters who worked with her also expressed their grief.
According to Tommy Dreamer, “Luna was the original queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night of two moons. Just like her, uniquely beautiful. A strong woman.”
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said in a statement, "Luna was just as crazy as I was... maybe more so... I love her and miss her... We hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people you surveyed before the 2010 federal election, opposition to Australia becoming a republic has grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the polling station share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last queen.
On the fringes of the election, 29 percent of those surveyed believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was entered in the 100m and 200m freestyle swimming events and also in three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was in doubt due to injuries.
Because he was banned from the games, he couldn't take the medication he needed to manage his pain.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Many people, using various hardware and software, confirmed the discovery by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of Earth's water supply, along with organic materials that could create proteins and support life.
Because comets collided with Earth a long time ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth was formed.
The 53-year-old Cuomo began his administration earlier this year and last month signed into law the legalization of same-sex marriage.
He described the agitators as engaging in "political turmoil and foolishness."
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA touts as enabling aircraft to save millions of gallons of fuel annually and make shorter trips, reducing carbon emissions.
Unlike older ground-based radar technology, air traffic controllers use satellite-based technology to identify aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more precise information.
There are no extra services, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley; also, parking is unavailable at our park-and-ride facilities.
Fears of transportation shortages have increased the likelihood that the game will be held behind closed doors without fans.
A study published in the science journal on Thursday reported on the emergence of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that a new species was formed in just two generations due to interbreeding between the rare Darwin's finch, *Geospiza fortis*, and the introduced cactus finch, *Geospiza conirostris*, even though this process was previously thought to take much longer.
Gold can be made into all sorts of shapes. It can be molded into tiny shapes.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be bent and twisted. It can be hammered or rolled into smoothness.
It is worked until very thin and adheres to other metals. Because it can be made so thin, it was used as decoration on hand-drawn illustrations in books called "Illuminated Manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage liquid.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity (base) of the chemical.
The pH level in the tested chemical indicates the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (therefore, hydrogen atoms contain one proton and one electron).
Sift the two dry flours together, then press them into a ball with clean, damp hands.
The moisture on your hands clashes with the outer layers, creating a funny feeling and forming a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in Minoan cities in Greece, within the houses of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women were together in a mixed setting.
When you call someone who lives thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space received the signal and instantly reflected it back.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Researchers use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and views.
To put a satellite or telescope into space, you need a giant rocket that is over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is that it has given us very easy and fast transportation.
He brought us the train, the car, and many other transportation vehicles.
Under them, there are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized animals ranging from rabbits to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat a huge variety of small animals, such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is a field concept, a special task that prevents each cat from competing with the others.
Lions are very social cats that live in large groups called prides.
Lion prides are typically made up of one to three young males, up to thirty females, and cubs.
The females are often very closely related to each other, with many being families of sisters and daughters.
Lions' manes are very dangerous for animals like lions (but not other big cats) and their prey, just like wolves or dogs.
The leopard is a well-rounded athlete, capable of climbing (although not very well), swimming, jumping long distances, and pulling with five times the force of a strong man.
Tigers, like lions, leopards, and jaguars, are in the same group (genus Panthera). These are the only four cats that can roar.
A leopard's roar isn't as full-throated as a lion's, but more like a raspy and grating noise.
Ocelots/wildcats like to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots/wildcats hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists have found that ocelots track their prey by sniffing and following the scent to the places where they (the prey animals) have been.
They can see well in low light and move with agility. Ocelots blend in with their surroundings to find prey.
Small populations (i.e., a small number of individuals) that originate from a larger parent population (e.g., after passing through a mountainous region, crossing a river, or simply traveling to a new island from which they cannot return) often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has diverse resources and diverse competitors, therefore the new species requires different traits or adaptations to become a strong competitor, more so than previously needed.
The original species never changed; it still seeks the same accommodation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, its similarities with other populations decrease.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will have diverged so much in appearance that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means creating new species. Creating new species is an inevitable result and an essential part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe, and they also absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale (that is, what is breathed out).
Plants prepare their food through photosynthesis using sunlight. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants, and we also make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Animals cannot live without plants.
The mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, and therefore feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were armed with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and it possessed an additional set on the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet consisted of turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly even its own offspring.
It attacked anything that entered the water, and even a massive dinosaur like a T-Rex would be no match for it.
Although we know most of their diet, the Romans had strange or unusual feast dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of mouse called dormouse.
Another difference is that the poor and the women like to sit on chairs and eat, while the rich like to have a big feast where they can enjoy themselves on the side while eating their food.
Ancient Roman meals could not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or even cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a main temple that was considered a house of gods for them.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to attend to the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, distinctive pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for his god.
In the Middle East's hot climate, the house wasn't very important.
Much of Hebrew family life was conducted outdoors.
Women cook food in the yard; the shops had open-air counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while sailing west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were living there at the time.
Even if every country were "Scandinavian," there were many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even though there is something written on the back of the document, this is not a treasure map.

Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, early in its life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be seated upon.
Therefore, the note may have been added simply as an identifier.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were heading back towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a broad population of people who live and work together cooperatively in a society.
The word "civilization" comes from "civilis," which means civil. When connected to the Latin "civis," it means citizen, and "civitas" means city or city-state, which somehow describes the size of the society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. Civilization signifies the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and equitable distribution.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving behind valuable historical evidence and are not recognized as standard civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially established a weak central government—with Congress as its sole body—under the Articles of Confederation.
The council had no power to levy taxes, and with no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state leaders who often did not cooperate in enforcing all its laws.
It also did not have the authority to abolish tax laws and tariffs between regions.
The articles required unanimous consent from all regions before they could be approved, and their representatives largely remained absent because the regions did not perceive the central government correctly.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is one of the most successful teams in the world, and they were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Italians compete in global games and the Olympics, with winter sports being most prominent in the northern regions.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is called Honshu), making it the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to its collection/group of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" geographically speaking.
Taiwan's history began in the 15th century when European sailors passing by named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established itself in southern Taiwan by instigating changes in indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese day laborers to work in its sugar and rice factories.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces seized control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan by signing the Treaty of Shimonoseki, and the island was under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures called the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings within the compound have been reconstructed to give tourists a better understanding of how they originally looked.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the reconstruction work still continues.
For example, the most common image photography format in the world is still 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still in production today, but its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital cameras' image sensor formats.
The 35mm format was actually somewhat confusing, being 36mm wide by 24mm high.
It is said that the aspect ratio of this format is 3:2 (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio).
Many common formats (e.g., the APS format family) have this aspect ratio equal to or very close to.
The third-party rule, where the subject is off-center and being laughed at, is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining a certain level of balance in the image.
It is said that the most effective spot for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked the states of Europe together, despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its destructive power affects everyone, from the great to the small.
One of the core Christian tenets is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's financial fund is specifically allocated for this purpose.
The Church's central authority had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether its fundamental doctrinal commitment was being fulfilled.
Soon after tensions arose, Britain began to blockade the German navy.
Even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified in numerous international agreements over the past two centuries, the strategy of cutting off essential military and civilian supplies has been effective.
Britain booby-trapped international waters with bombs to prevent any of its ships from passing through vast bodies of water, which posed a danger even to neutral ships.
Since the method only had a limited answer, Germany expected the same for unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing sentiment among many citizens and nations was anti-war and isolationist.
After witnessing the horrors and brutality of war during World War I, nations sought to avoid such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
In his name, he entered the US with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different periods of time, each era or ruling family clearly distinguished by a dynasty.
And it was an unstable period of divided regional states among each dynasty. The most well-known of these times was the Three Kingdoms period, which took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, a heavy war took place between many nobles who were vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was a bloody time in ancient Chinese history, with thousands fighting and dying in the Xian Palace as they struggled to sit on the highest throne.
Like the adoption of the metric system, there are several social and political impacts such as the shift from feudalism to populism, nationalism, and the idea that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, after the revolution, highly sought-after professions that would allow them to be successful were open to all male applicants.
It's the same for the soldier too, because army ranks were now based on caliber rather than being based on division.
The French Revolution inspired working-class people in many other oppressed countries to start their own revolts.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to frequently go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which survived the passage of time, provides a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Landing on the mountain peaks north of Mecca isolated the cave completely from the rest of the world.
In reality, even if one knows of its existence, finding it is not easy at all. Once inside the cave, it's a total isolation.
Nothing is visible except for the clear, beautiful sky around the many mountains. From inside the cave, one can only see or hear a very small part of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, is one of several large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The "Giza Plateau" or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt contains several pyramids (including the Great Pyramid, which is the largest), numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and most of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family.
"The upper plica sign looks like a V, and the lower plica sign looks like a staple wire or a square missing its bottom part."
Going up means you have to push the bow starting at the tip, while going down means you have to start from the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and draw the bow.
The upstroke usually produces a softer sound, while the downstroke is stronger and more assertive.
You can mark your own bowing with a pencil, but the printed bowing marks are there for musical reasons and should be respected.
The very distraught King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a mob of angry market women to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris surrounded by many people who were shouting and making threats against the King and Queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, a member of a mob was waving the head of a royal guard, who had been killed at Versailles, in front of the horrified queen.
U.S. imperialism made the Filipino people pay for the costs of the war.
In the name of the Philippine government, they agreed to pay the US purchasing power through Wall Street banks, covering air expenses and bond interest.
Indeed, the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people brings fundamental benefits to US imperialism from its most profitable established interests.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the circumstances that motivated the religious group's formation.
The period in which these activities occurred is known as the High Middle Ages, encompassing the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300) in European history.
The High Middle Ages are preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a strong sentiment that inclines one to think that technology commitment, in practice, involves numerous ideas, stemming from a technology-push or the necessity of technology, towards a fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and the revelation of technology regarding human destiny.
Most definitions of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a largely autonomous path, beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "impacts" on societies that are inherent rather than socially shaped.
For example, one could say that a motor vehicle inevitably leads to road development.
However, a nationwide road network for small cars is not economically feasible, so new production methods have been established to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Owning multiple cars also leads to a higher chance of accidents on the road, which in turn leads to the creation of new techniques for repairing damaged vehicles/bodies.
Romanticism was a significant part of the cultural commitment derived from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and subsequently, cultures associated with geography and arbitrary rules harmonizing with a society's place were superior.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was called the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a luxury center lasted from 400 AD to 1100 AD.
In the twelfth century, the situation calmed down as Christian warriors primarily returned with highly valued gifts, such as silk and spices, which were more prized than what the Byzantine market offered.
It was during this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was prominent between the 10th and 11th centuries and peaked in the 14th century.
Initially, the dress was highly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication methods, lifestyles in the west can be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
Around the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europeans began to create their own fashion styles. One of the biggest developments of the time, driven by the wars, was that people started using buttons to close their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture means that a farmer has produce that can only benefit him and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, often organic, using native or saved seeds, and incorporating crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production while living in harmony with the local ecosystem.
Historically, the majority of farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can vary based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic style, encompassing fashion, practices, and argot.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of social life is by looking at children who grew up in adverse conditions, abuse, or suffering, and who did not learn to live with their caregivers.
Children like these are called "feral" or abandoned. Some abandoned children are neglected by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the reason a child is abandoned is because the parents cannot accept the child's severe mental or physical disability.
The children who are fighting may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they started fighting or running away.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the forest.
When a non-human animal is fully grown, a feral child fully exhibits animal-like characteristics (e.g., fear or indifference towards humans).
While project-based learning is necessary to make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals embarking on a new learning process, for example, those using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Summaries can be virtual or real. In other words, a virtual assistant is one way to summarize, just like attaching a paper in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded within the software and are intended to prompt the student to inquire, investigate, and explain processes that might be challenging to grasp independently.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even theft.
No child should grow up in an environment devoid of care, concern, and education, but inevitably, some do.
We see the foster care system as a zone of safety for these children.
Our foster care system is intended to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is believed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The internet combines the characteristics of mass media and interpersonal communication.
Regarding the uses and gratifications approach, the unique characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been identified as key motivators for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Furthermore, "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were identified as newly emerging aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when examining audience responses to websites.
Video recording has led to important discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions and facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
It is believed that, especially, by accurately interpreting micro-expressions, one can ascertain whether a person is lying or not.
In his writing, Oliver Sacks pointed out how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage were still able to accurately assess sincerity, in relation to the president's speech.
He mentioned that such abilities to distinguish human nature can be shared even by animals like domesticated dogs.
A study conducted in the twentieth century shows that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes from the expressed variation pool.
The dialectical tension between the two reservoirs of separation and reunification with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for hominins, who have a human-like digestive system, to satisfy their amino acid requirements from the plant food sources available there.
Furthermore, failure to do this has serious consequences: depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources might have been proteins found in leaves and grains, but these are difficult for mammals like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easily chewable and provide high levels of protein that include all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" on the savanna in a way not dissimilar to what chimpanzees do today.
Sleep fragmentation is a process of waking up consciously during your regular sleep period and falling back asleep after a short time (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it might be helpful to place it on the opposite side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces a person to wake up to urinate.
A person's inner peace is inversely proportional to the amount of stress in their body and mind.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life energy becomes. Every person has the potential to achieve perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can acquire knowledge. The only thing standing in the way is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but extended by the Mahayana path of compassion and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It involves Kundalini yoga, meditation, and an all-encompassing journey of love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the power of awareness) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan meditation center is Deity Yoga. Through contemplation on various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and a consciousness of enlightened wisdom is created.
In World War II, Germany was a common enemy, fostering collaboration between the USSR and the United States. When the war ended, systemic, procedural, and cultural conflicts led the countries toward collapse.
The Cold War began two years before the war ended, as former allies had now become enemies.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and the actual fighting would take place on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had been broken, and the only remaining hope was to retreat and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans collapsed overnight after 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded Poland's eastern territories, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, and subsequently formed Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using ships to transport goods is still the most effective way to transport many people and goods across the ocean.
The traditional role of naval forces is to ensure your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while simultaneously disrupting your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the recent examples that deserves to be written about is the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move people and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, primarily using U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allied powers had fallen, Germany could have occupied the rest of Europe entirely and perhaps even Britain.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to expect milk, hair, meat, and hides to be readily available to them.
Most of the time, domestic goats are kept in herds that roam in the mountains or other grazing areas, often accompanied by a shepherd, either a child or an adult. These herding methods are still in use today.
Wagonways were built in England at the beginning of the 16th century.
Even though the carts consisted only of parallel planks, they allowed horses to pull them for greater speed and to haul larger loads than would have been possible on the somewhat difficult roads of the time.
Crossings were introduced early on to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that tracks would be more effective if they had iron ore on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, which began around the time Homo erectus (meaning "upright man") emerged, two million years ago.
The earlier australopithecines did not walk upright as a matter of course.
While bipedal adaptations have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the local movement, and we can even become advocates to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is like treating the symptoms in many situations. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we need to find and eliminate the root causes of the problems.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot due to scientific and technological advancements, and problems are increasing due to population and the excessive lifestyle of mankind.
After being approved by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was taken a few blocks away to the printing house.
Throughout the night, 150 to 200 copies of what are now called "Dunlap Broadsides" were produced.
The first public reading of the document was on July 8 by John Nixon at Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9. The copy arrived in London on August 10.
So far, the 25 known Dunlop broadside ballads are ancient copies that survived from the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many things about birds, they seem like dinosaurs.
They have legs with teeth and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Currently, most computers are based on data transmission coded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number has only one or two place values; that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary numbers - or bits - to use computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are general enough that a quick diagnosis may not be possible.
The best indication of possible poisoning is the presence of accessible medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions if there is a specific antidote for that particular poison.
The word "bug" is the commonly used name by entomologists to refer to a specific group of insects.
This term comes from an ancient lineage of bedbugs, insects that are highly adapted to living in close proximity to humans.
Both biting midges and bed bugs are parasitic, and their nests are adapted to live in or on their parasitic habitat.
Across America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has confirmed that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS (Multiple Sclerosis).
Couples can decide that raising a child is not their desire or the child's desire.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise their children.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method effectively guides most scientific research.
But it's not just that; experimentation is a test used to eliminate one or more hypotheses, and asking questions and conducting observations also guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's view is accepted on all scientific matters, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge diminished, Westerners found themselves disconnected from their Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many variations observed in physiology and behavior are often primarily determined by the existence of circadian rhythms and their productivity on biological clocks.
Circadian rhythms that do not respond readily to external time cues have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain free-running cycling rhythms even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading pieces of evidence that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to introduce their own DNA into bacteria.
Drs. Hershey and Chase conducted two experiments, marking phage with radioactive phosphorus or protein phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have diverse effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations in other cells can cause the cell to die or lead to cancer.
Nature-based tourism entertains people who are interested in visiting natural environments, including enjoying plants, animals, and wildlife.
Examples of activities that take place on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example would be learning about, visiting, and photographing orangutans in Borneo.
People commute by car from small rural towns to their workplaces every morning, and other people take over their previous locations as their work destination.
In this dynamic transportation vessel, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has disrupted the biosphere from the stable state that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, one sometimes hears equal complaints about water quality and collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, and why do they fail daily? Does it simply mean that transportation engineers are incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points, and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it's impossible to predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave with reasonable consistency, therefore traffic flows have a certain reasonable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
Relationships between the three main characteristics have been established to better represent traffic flow: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and executing road infrastructure works.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them easily escape predators and efficiently find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings by bringing their bodies backward.
This provides them with a wide range of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people used to believe that the solar system, including the sun (and other stars as well), revolved around the Earth, even though some thought it was right, many people believed the opposite.
This seems reasonable, since the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It holds 8 times more water than the second largest river.
Furthermore, the Amazon is the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
Fully 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main length is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller tributary rivers.
Although pyramid construction continued in stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in their size and technical dimensions of construction.
The New Kingdom Egyptians marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the world's smallest sovereign country and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its constitution and official communication.
Italian is also a daily language used by most who work in the state, and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because all of these can be found in nature and are easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is similar to the four states of matter (in the same order) - solid, liquid, gas, and plasma - but he proposed that they transform into new elements to create what we see.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Indeed, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys that include non-carbon elements.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Sadly, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and fewer uses.
People now type messages on computer screens without ever needing to approach a printing press.
When something new comes along, one can only wonder what will become of the keyboard.
A fission bomb works on the principle of assembling as much mass as possible of protons and neutrons into a nucleus.
Like a heavy cart rolling uphill. Re-splitting the nucleus and then releasing some of the energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay by splitting apart spontaneously or with little provocation.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
The root of the *mariyee* is thin, while the root of the *dega* is thick.
There could be a lot of lava tubes nearby because the crust is thin; it was easy for the lava to rise to the surface.
The current concepts focus on finding what attracts people.
These concepts suggest that as people mature into adulthood, they possess certain inherent needs and/or desires.
These concepts refer to what makes certain people want to do something and what causes things in their environment to make them do or not do certain things.
Two well-known content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two tendencies can arise when managers start leading their former peers. One is the temptation to continue being "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, it shifts to an unpredictable individual who feels they must change everything the group has been doing and make it their own.
Come what may, ultimately the leader takes responsibility for the group's success and failure.
This behavior often causes conflict between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same high standards as traditional teams, but they have subtle differences.
Virtual team members serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical team.
Because they are more often self-managed than typical team members, they meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by the managers around them.
The existence of a real "covert team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique aspect of the virtual team.
"The Invisible Team" is a management team to which each member reports. The Invisible Team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? Implementing organizational learning concepts is a goal-creating endeavor.
If all available resources are used properly within the organization's work units, innovation and ingenuity will be prominent.
As a result, an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must foster a culture of creativity, as well as create shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the institutional approach as a continuous method used to help organizations reach high performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence regarding the theoretical approach of recognition testing. Therefore, it narrows the scope of the research and makes it more accurate.
The relationship between the study of mental illness and behavior helps researchers in their investigations.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, emotional traumas, injuries, and internal inflammations can affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to view and examine brain structures and processes in ways never before seen.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI is a very important part of computer science that studies behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include the ability to control, plan and schedule, respond to customer inquiries and requests, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face.
Such things have become distinct systems, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now largely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military; they have also been integrated into many home computers and video game applications.
Field trips are an integral part of any class. Often, the teacher prefers to take her students to places that are impossible to reach by bus.
Technology offers the solution of virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquatic environments, or admire beautiful artwork while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on the experience while traveling and share lessons learned for future learning.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their annual trip to the state capital; the website is revised every year, but existing versions stay online as they are used for reference.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with flawed grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Because students are often very critical audiences, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
"Furthermore, blogging "forces students to be more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to cater to the audience's interests motivates students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004)."
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to enhance their learning beyond the typical school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "empowers students to become analytical and strong critics; by responding diligently to online educational materials, students can express their position in relation to other texts and articulate their own perspectives on specific issues" (O'Ravek, 2002).
Ottawa, the charming, bilingual capital of Canada, is home to numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is located to the south, while to the north lies Muskoka and beyond, untouched natural beauty.
All these things and more contribute to Ontario being safely considered Canadian by outsiders.
To the north, the vast open spaces are not only scarce, but some are uninhabitable deserts.
To the surprise of many, the African American population residing in the United States outnumbers the entire citizenry of Canada.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is still one of the largest and, in itself, a continent.
Most of the small islands are either independent nations or affiliated with France, and are known for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the land, and it spread widely in Comoros and Mayotte.
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's discovery of the Cape route from Europe to India initiated European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female travelers, regardless of their actual marital status, state that they are married.
Wearing a ring is also beneficial (even if it doesn't seem very expensive).
Women need to be mindful that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as harassment, and being followed, having their hands pulled, etc., is not uncommon.
Be firm in saying no to men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen, and was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese demolished it and rebuilt it under the name "Casa Branca," but abandoned it again after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city, renaming it Dar al-Beida, and it was later named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least exciting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find traditional Moroccan goods being sold, such as pottery, leather products, shisha pipes, and general trinkets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the eastern tip of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano eruption destroyed and buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any trips outside Goma should be assessed to understand the ongoing combat situation in North Kivu province.
He added that the city is one of the most affordable places in Africa for mountain gorilla trekking and also serves as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The standard (local) price for a short trip is ~500 Congolese Francs.
Its relative inaccessibility, coupled with its existence, has made "Timbuktu" an archetypal symbol for rare and remote lands.
Even today, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
It was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger in 1990 due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS series, "Africa's Great Civilizations."
Because it has more of an Arab appearance than an African one, the city is in complete contrast to the other cities in the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each containing different wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered a flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entry fees for the park.
It might be worthwhile for someone to buy a Wild Card, which gives entry options to parks in South Africa, including all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gave the Hong Kong territory its name and is considered a major attraction by many tourists.
The Hong Kong skyline, a tapestry of skyscrapers, is juxtaposed with the dazzling bar chart created by Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along its northern shore.
This is a place that English colonizers took as their own, and so if you want evidence of the region's colonial era, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest, stretching about 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coastlines of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest area within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include the last remnants of the formidable jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km², of which one-third is covered by water/swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is currently estimated to contain around 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the intercity bus terminal (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses within the district are often full, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese coaster buses.
Shared taxis like Paro (Nu 150) and Panakha (Nu 200) are fast and convenient ways to travel to nearby places.
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the entire Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, with a height of 378 meters and a two-lane road that is 3.50 meters wide.
The direct height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not open to the public until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs inspection is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were a very important indigenous group who lived in what is now eastern Paraguay as semi-nomadic hunters, also practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was born out of the clash between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups, in what was formerly called the "immense province of the Indies".
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted for three hundred years.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción, Paraguay has managed to preserve many indigenous characteristics and identities.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The year's biggest tournament will be held in December at Las Canitas, on the polo fields.
Here, smaller competitions and games can also be seen during other times of the year.
Check with the Argentine Polo Association for news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games.
The Falkland Pound (FKP) is the official currency of the Falkland Islands, pegged at parity with the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the Stanley islands, beyond the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
While British Pounds and US Dollars might be accepted, credit cards may not be accepted in the outer islands; confirm with the owners in advance what the accepted payment method is.
It is impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands; therefore, exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it has summer when the northern hemisphere has winter, and winter conversely.
Montevideo is located in a humid subtropical zone; in summer, temperatures of +30°C are common.
Winter can be surprisingly cold, with temperatures sometimes dropping below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel even colder than the thermometer suggests.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons; rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other animals.
No matter how tame they may seem, buffaloes, boars, deer, bears, and all large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they do not maintain a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals; therefore, avoid carrying or preparing odorous foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port became the scene of a little-known naval standoff when seven ships from Germany, America, and Britain refused to leave.
Except for one British warship, all the ships had sunk. About 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the Mau Mau freedom struggle, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the paramount chief, Tuፗ Tamasese Lealofi III.
Oakland has many beaches due to its two harbors. The most well-known are located in three places.
The seas with northern shorelines (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
All can agree that they are sandy beaches ideal for swimming, and many have shelter provided by pōhutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive is Auckland's waterfront playground on the Waitematā Harbour, located in central Auckland between the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers.
These are family beaches with various types of shops that sometimes get crowded, surrounding the beachfront. Swimming is reassuring.
The main domestic beer is 'Number One,' which is pleasant and satisfying, rather than complex. Another domestic beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines to take, but New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
The idea of a "flat white" coffee is very foreign to Australians. A short black is an espresso, a cappuccino comes piled high with cream (not froth), and tea is also served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although fruit juices are expensive, they are very good.
Sea trips occur throughout the year, and injuries caused by these sea-related incidents are rare.
Continue to take advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur north of 1770 from October to April near seaside resorts and river mouths. Outside of these times, they can be found occasionally.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean for extended periods; their primary habitat is the Fitzroy River in the northern part of Rockhampton.
Registering in advance gives travelers peace of mind, as they know they will have a place to rest after they arrive.
While you might find that you can book other accommodation types, such as campsites, through a travel agent, travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels.
Travel agents often offer packages or bundled flight and hotel deals that include breakfast and airport transfers.
They may also hold the spot for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, any modifications or requests should be handled through the travel agent, not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, especially music festivals, many participants decide to camp on-site, and many attendees consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should arrive early to get a spot close to the music.
Keep in mind that even if the main stages run out of music, there may be festival sections that play music until late into the night.
Some festivals have a separate camping area for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic in winter, verify the cabin layout because traveling through the ice creates a very distressing noise, especially for those who are sensitive.
St. Petersburg cruises include city time. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos commonly make many efforts to maximize the time and money that guests spend. Windows and clocks are often absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They mostly have special food, drinks, and entertainment provisions to keep guests in good spirits and lingering at the entrance.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks for free. However, being drunk impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the benefit of not being drunk.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or on mountain passes should expect the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On snowy and icy roads, traction is limited, and you can't drive like you would on bare asphalt.
During periods of extreme cold, ice can accumulate very quickly, potentially immobilizing you.
Visibility can be obstructed by falling or blowing snow, sleet, or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, in many countries, snowy and icy conditions are common, and traffic mostly continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps what most attract tourism in Africa and highlight it for many visitors.
The word "safari" commonly refers to traveling on land to view the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, so standard equipment provides a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are best viewed through binoculars.
Hiking (also called "bushwalking", "hill walking", or "trekking") involves walking for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other areas throughout Japan.
With hosting the games in 1964, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted the summer Olympics twice.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodation before the extension was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-related cancellation policies that existed through the end of March did not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were postponed.
While VIP tickets are expected to cost around ¥7,000, most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have a cautery or don't enjoy using a lit sock, you can use a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful that the iron doesn't get too hot (it can cause wrinkling or, in some severe cases, burning).
There are various methods to purify water, and some are effective for specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in others, several minutes are required.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar animal pests in their areas of origin.
Pests can contaminate food, cause irritation, or in worse cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Contagious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can violently harm or kill a person, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase certain goods exempt from mandatory taxes in specific areas.
Travelers going to countries with heavy taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often presents very difficult driving conditions, passing through isolated terrain.
If you are not used to driving on regional roads, maintain your caution: there are often steep hills, narrow roads, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower in the primary and subsequent sections — typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and strict adherence to them is much more worthwhile than non-compliance.
Surprisingly, the mobile service is stronger here than in places where the lines are more established, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweet cakes are very cool and, like their southern neighbor Bavaria, Austria, are rich and varied.
Fruit pies are common, with apples ripening into pies year-round, and berries and stone fruits appearing in the summer.
Many baked goods in Germany include nuts, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair exceptionally well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small sweet cakes, try to find out what Berliner Pfannkuchen or Krapfen are, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, served with meat or vegetables.
A dish roasted with spices can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries, while in southern India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more often used.
Encompassing 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a general term covering the wide range of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without any other qualifiers, the word refers to the food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Currently, it is widely available in the archipelago, and the Javanese culinary method includes simply seasoned foods, with Javanese people's favorite main condiments being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer the driver more stability, but there may be safety concerns as the driver's foot could get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but one foot remains caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged while the horse runs. Many safety precautions should be taken to reduce the risk.
First, many riders put on their riding boots, which have a heel and smooth, narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if a rider who is about to fall is pulled backward.
Coihueco Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, dubbed the "South American Yosemite," boasts numerous diverse granite big walls and boulders.
High-altitude locations offer incredibly stunning views. Climbers from all over the world are creating new routes amidst the endless rock faces.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports where one slides downhill on snow-covered ground on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with a large following of enthusiasts, known as "snow lovers," who plan entire vacation seasons around skiing in one location.
The idea of ​​skiing is very old - the drawings assumed to depict skiers on cave walls date back to 5000 BC!
The sport of downhill skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Traveling with a ski touring backpack is an activity called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
While often associated with alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, it doesn't include these; the latter taking place in narrow terrain and requiring very sturdy ski poles or plastics and boots.

Although Europe is a relatively small continent, it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling between different countries means spending a lot of time on visa applications and passport control.
In this regard, the Schengen Zone functions almost like a single country.
Within this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control or checkpoints.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for Schengen member countries, so you save time, money, and paperwork.
There is no internationally agreed-upon definition of what types of products qualify as heritage items. Some tax organizations define goods older than 100 years as heritage items.

Handicraft products, even though younger in age than mass-produced goods, can be described as antique.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood in Sami areas, and the culture surrounding the trade is also very important for many in connection with other professions.

A satellite phone is not a complete replacement for a mobile phone because when you make a satellite phone call, you need to be outdoors in clear view so that you have a direct line of sight to the satellite.
The service is frequently used for transportation, including recreational crafts and trips that require remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
For people planning a vacation, a growing trend is to travel and learn.
