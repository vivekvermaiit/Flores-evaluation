At the end of 2017, Siminoff appeared on the shopping television channel QVC.
Ring settled a lawsuit with a security company that was also a competitor, namely ADT Corporation.
Although one experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce Ebola deaths, to date, no drugs have been clearly shown to be suitable for treating existing infection.
One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies suggested it had less benefit than claimed in terms of preventing death.
In the PALM trial, Zmapp served as the control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee’s letter and accepts the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by moving forward with meaningful change within our organization, rather than decertification.
USA Gymnastics is assisting an independent investigation that could shed light on how abuse on the scale so bravely described by Larry Nassar's survivors could have gone undetected for so long, and welcomes any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal - to make the sport of gymnastics, and other sports, as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.

As well as confirming that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's feathers are chestnut brown on the upper side with a pale or carrot-coloured underside.
The discovery provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers as well.
Since dinosaur feathers lack well-developed shafts, called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics - barbules and barbs - the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flying but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult feathers and not downy fluff.
The researchers suggested that although this was a young dinosaur's tail, the sample showed adult feathers and not chick down.
A car bomb exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.
The governor's office said that sixteen of those injured were police officers.
The police said they suspected that a Daesh (ISIL) soldier was responsible for the attack.
They discovered that the Sun operates on the same fundamental principles as other stars: the activity of every star in the system was found to be driven by its luminosity, its rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is from the perspective of magnetic reversals.

He added that "they should not, however, be asked to take on obligations that go beyond their step, responsibility and development capabilities."
The Iraq Study Group presented its report at 12.00 GMT today.
He warns that no one can guarantee that any action in Iraq at this point will prevent sectarian warfare, escalating violence, or a slide into anarchy.
The Report opens with a plea for open debate and consensus-building in the United States regarding policy towards the Middle East.
The Report is very critical of almost every aspect of the Executive's current policy towards Iraq and urges a new direction immediately.
First among its 78 recommendations is the recommendation that a new diplomatic initiative should be launched before the end of this year to protect Iraq's borders against hostile interference and to re-establish diplomatic relations with its neighbours.
The current senator and First Lady of Argentina, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, announced her candidacy for the presidency last night in La Plata, a city 50 kilometers (31 miles) away from Buenos Aires.
Mrs Kirchner announced her intention to run for the presidency at the Argentine Theatre, the same location she used to launch her 2005 campaign for the Senate as a representative of the province of Buenos Aires.
The debate was sparked by arguments about spending on aid and reconstruction in the wake of Hurricane Katrina; some fiscal conservatives have amusingly labeled it the "New Orleans Bush Deal".
Liberal criticism of the reconstruction effort has focused on awarding reconstruction contracts to those seen as Washington insiders.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was searching for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls on the Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around the galaxy as a kind of halo, and that it consists of a number of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "causing great concern and was very frightening because of the very high mortality rate".
Some patients may have caught the infection in the hospital, according to Dr. Moll, and at least two were hospital healthcare workers.
In a year, one infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still appears to be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

Several million vials of encephalitis vaccine have also been promised by the government, which will help prepare health agencies for next year.
Plans to send vaccines to the areas most historically affected have been delayed this year due to lack of funding and low prioritisation compared to other diseases.

After the dam was built in 1963, it stopped the seasonal flooding that would spread sediment through the river.
This sediment was essential for creating sandbars and beaches, which were habitats for wildlife.
As a result, two species of fish have disappeared, and two more are at risk, including the humpback chub.
Although the water level will only rise a few feet after the flooding, officials hope this will be enough to restore eroded sandbars downstream.

Infrared images show that the temperature variations between night and day indicate that they are most likely caves.
They are colder than the surface surrounding them during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain fairly constant temperatures, but it is consistent with being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed paper ballot showing their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting register.
French electoral law organizes cases quite strictly.
Since 1998, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes are present at the start of voting other than those of authorised voters which have been properly counted.
Candidates are able to send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Her other race, the Giant Slalom, saw her finish tenth in the women's sitting group race with a combined running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the one who finished in first place, Claudia Loesch of Austria, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the one who finished ninth, Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's seated group failed to finish their runs, and a total of 45 out of 117 skiers failed to be ranked in the Giant Slalom.
Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of those accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed as emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
She was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya, who has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then, has been accused of murdering her son.
She is in custody until there is a charge and a case, but any eyewitness evidence could be tainted because her image has been published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have looked at publishing pictures as something that could be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are walking a dangerous line if they publish pictures etc. of suspects".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, has suggested to journalists that no further comments will be made until at least the indictment.
According to the source, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 Middle East War borders.
Reportedly, other topics to be addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a continued military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA is agreeing to allow such a presence for only five years.
Archers in the additional pest control trial will be closely supervised by gamekeepers, as the trial is being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Interim Director of Conservation and Heritage for the Park with NPWS, the four marksmen chosen for the first shooting campaign received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEO as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the government that began in October.
The protests, which were sometimes violent, were triggered by a failure to hold elections, some of which were supposed to have been held since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of faulty iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 24 additional cases of overheating, with the company calling them "not serious".
The administration responded by calling Apple's report delay "truly unfortunate".
The Mariana earthquake struck at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said that no damage had been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, along with the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers took the place of an older woman because she needed the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and went into a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births during his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs in the womb.
Xinhua reported that government investigators had discovered two flight recorder "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first ruler. Luna died on a two-moon night. So unique just like her. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels made the comment that "Luna was as weird as me… maybe even more so… I love her and I will miss her… I hope she is in a better place".
Of 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 election campaign, Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the survey share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100m and 230m freestyle and in three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his problems, there is doubt about his fitness.
He hasn't been able to take the drugs he needs to overcome his pain because they're banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several individuals verified the finding using hardware and software by early February and it was published on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were the source of supplying water to the Earth, along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and sustaining life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, as comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumours as "foolish political gossip".
There's speculation that he will run for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
There is no additional transport being arranged and overground trains will not be stopping at Wembley, and car parking or park and ride facilities are not available at the stadium.
Fears over a lack of transport raised the possibility that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors without team supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new species of bird on the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species had evolved in just two generations, although this process was believed to have taken much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons with their electrons removed (since Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a complex sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women socialized together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
It takes a huge rocket over 100 feet tall to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us much easier and faster transportation.
He has brought us the train, the car, and many other transportation devices.
Beneath them are cats of more moderate size that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special job for each cat that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three related adult male lions, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually close to each other, a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs (but not to other big cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger isn't like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of guttural words being shouted.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. All the animals that ocelots hunt are almost much smaller than itself.
Scientists think that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by smelling, sensing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move very stealthily, too. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (as if moving across a series of mountains or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it is not easy to move back), it will often find itself in an environment different from the one it was in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population began to adapt to their new environment, they started to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also offer shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Plants are most of the foods we eat. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were filled with more than 70 very sharp teeth, along with an extra set on the roof of its mouth, meaning nothing that crossed its path could escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It would also attack anything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would not be its equal.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feast items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of dormouse called a pathew.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women ate their food sitting in chairs, the wealthy men liked to have feasts together, reclining on their sides as they ate their meals.
Meals in Ancient Rome could not have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have grain, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of that god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to meet the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
The girls were cooking in the yard; the shops with open counters looked out over the street. Stones were being used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the lands of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland had been sparsely colonised. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and travelling further west, he discovered Greenland and called it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living in the area at the time.

If you've seen the film National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4th, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known early in its life that the large vellum document (it measured 29 and three-quarter inches by 24 and a half inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it's likely that the notation was added as a label only.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
They were ruled by "Vichy" France. These were French people who had agreed to peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders rather than fight them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked southern France, an attack that was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just a fortnight, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture that is shared by a significantly large group of people who live together and cooperate as a society.
The word "civilisation" comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civic, pertaining to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and that somehow defines the size of the society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilised culture implies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and a fair distribution.
Often small cultures disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies first formed a weak central government - with only Congress as its component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to enforce taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it depended on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
He also had no authority to undermine tax and tariff laws between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states were so dismissive of the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, as well as the Germany national football team, are the second most successful team in the world and they were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Because of the cluster, a group of islands possessed by Japan, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical perspective, as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginnings start far back in the 15th century where passing European sailors record the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which controlled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, and this was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high, which is a bit confusing.
Therefore, it is said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) are equal to or roughly equivalent to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often misused and mocked, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, became subject to scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound the countries of Europe together despite variations in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's financial resources are specifically there for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this accumulation of power and money led many to question whether this creed was being fulfilled.
Soon after the war started, Britain initiated a blockade against the German navy.
The strategy proved effective, blocking vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the predominant attitudes of the majority of citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.

Ancient China had a unique way of indicating different time periods; each Chinese period or family in power was a distinct dynasty.
There was also an unstable era of divided states between each dynasty. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which occurred for 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these periods, fierce warfare occurred between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China; thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are a number of social effects such as the use of the metric system, the move from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just one ruler.
Also, occupations were open to all male candidates after the Revolution, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true of soldiers because, rather than the army ranks being based on class, they were now based on the quality of the gun.
The French Revolution also inspired many other working-class people who were oppressed in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a great interest in matters beyond this trivial life. He used to go to a cave that came to be called "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the ages, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Lying on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you are inside the cave, it's complete isolation.
It is impossible to see anything except the beautiful clear sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of a number of large pyramid structures built to honor deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains a number of pyramids (the great pyramid is the largest), a number of small tombs, a number of temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "caret" mark looks like a V and the "chevron" mark looks like a staple or a square with its bottom side missing.
Up means you should start at the front and push the bow, and down means you should start at the handle (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up bow usually creates a softer sound, while a down bow is stronger and more definite.
You are welcome to mark your own bowings in pencil, but remember that the bowing marks are there for a musical reason, so they should be treated with respect as a rule.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, terrified, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a horde of market women.
In a carriage, they travelled back to Paris surrounded by a swarm of people screaming and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to have their carriage windows fully open.
Once, a member of the mob waved the head of a royal guard who had been killed in front of the Queen, who was terrified for her life.
The costs of the United States' imperialist war in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to pay a large amount of the spending and interest on bonds that were being raised in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the extraordinary profits derived from exploiting Filipino people would be tantamount to the core gains of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that motivated the creation of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries (c. 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which traditionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from pushing technology or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
The majority of interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has inherent "effects" on societies, rather than socially conditioned ones.
For example, one might say that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a road network across the country is not economically viable for a handful of cars alone, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher number of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
There was a strong element of cultural determinism in romanticism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and a culture arose that belonged to that geography, and these, existing in harmony with the society's place, were superior to laws imposed oppressively.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a luxury hub began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
His status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that Crusaders had returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices that were worth more than what Byzantine markets offered.
This is when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, fashions in the west could still be up to 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the era as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is carried out to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family alone.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses saved seeds native to the ecoregion along with crop rotation or other fairly simple techniques to ensure maximum yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still true in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture as unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Subculture members often display their membership through a unique and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, customs, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been enslaved by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the children had been abandoned because the parents had rejected the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have experienced abuse or serious trauma as children before being abandoned or running away.
It is claimed that others have been raised by animals; it is said that some have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviours (within physical limitations) almost entirely like those of the specific animal caring for it, such as its fear of or indifference to human beings.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step beyond that.
Scaffolding is not a method of teaching but rather a support that assists individuals experiencing new learning, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolding is embedded in the software and is intended to question, motivate, and explain procedures that may have been challenging for students to cope with on their own.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse, and even bereavement.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
We believe that the Care System is a safe space for these children.
Our foster care system is intended to provide safe homes, loving carers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is meant to provide all the necessities that were not being provided in the home they were taken from.
The internet combines elements of mass communication as well as interpersonal communication.
Specific features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialising" are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that whether an individual is lying can be detected by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his paper "President's Speech," Oliver Sacks suggested how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can nevertheless accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behaviour may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination move back and forth between two pools with each generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: slowed growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and pods, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also provide plenty of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
Having considered everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Interrupted sleep is the process of purposefully waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
It is possible to do this easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to awareness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which we know is diuretic) before sleeping, forcing someone to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more affirmed is the life force that is present. Every individual has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing preventing this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was extended by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a path of complete love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are energized, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the USA. With the end of the war, conflict in terms of system, process and culture caused the countries to clash.
Within two years of the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to continue for the next 40 years and would be fought in reality, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish guard had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost overnight superseded when over 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarussian and Ukrainian fronts after attacking the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional role of navies was to ensure that your country maintained the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly using U-boats.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany would have been able to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and hides.
Generally, domestic goats were kept in herds that roamed on hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by goat herders, who were usually children or young people, similar to the more well-known shepherd. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagonways comprised only parallel planks of wood, they enabled horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and haul larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the period.
Line slippers were introduced quite early to hold the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realised that tracks would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first method of travel we know of, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as often.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems, and we should alleviate them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and problems have become greater due to overpopulation and humanity's wasteful way of life.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
John Nixon gave the first public reading of this document in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and it was read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
These 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document known to still exist. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds have many features that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Every computer used today for any purpose is based on processing information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, that is 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits, or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
Perhaps the best sign of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or toxic chemicals in the home.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term beetles is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term derives from being intimately familiar with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Assassin bugs and bedbugs are drab, adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
Across the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop Multiple Sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, nor in the best interests of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become parents to the child.
The main aim of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method. In reality, this method guides most scientific research.
However, he/she/it is not alone; experimentation, which is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and, especially, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinion was accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
As understanding of Greek declined, the West found itself divorced from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
A number of rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to cycle freely even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments by either labeling the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material that is affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, but mutations elsewhere can cause cells to die or cause cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of activities on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking pictures of, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the countryside in cars to go to their workplaces and they are passed by others who are going to their work destination in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic shuttle of transport, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars, and supports the system.
By now, science suggests that this vast carbon economy has knocked the biosphere out of one of its stable states which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems provoke such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two places and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented approximately mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan, design, and implement road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and a mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people believed he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
This seems sensible, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest on Earth. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide at times.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing out of the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of their size or the technical brilliance of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marvelled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were already over a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official correspondence.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as each of these can be found in native form and they are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that everything was made of a mixture of one or more of four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more akin to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they changed into new substances to form what you see.
Essentially, alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit into the full stop at the end of this sentence.
So, the pension was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as new methods of writing have emerged, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and use.
Nowadays people write messages on computer screens, without having to get near a pen.
One can only speculate what the keyboard will be like when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's rather like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and about 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what motivates people or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they matured into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes specific people want the things they want, and what things in their environment will make them do, or not do, specific things.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory are two popular content theories.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can arise when managers begin to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the lads" (or lasses).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, performance appraisals, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, there's someone who turns into an unrecognisable individual who feels they must change everything the team has been doing and take ownership of it.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Shadow teams are held to the same standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their team may meet according to different time zones that their local managers may not understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team that every member reports to. The invisible team sets the standards for every member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the laborious process of establishing a learning organisation? One goal for putting organisational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across an organization's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer's need.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. Therefore, it narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior assists scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advancement of new technologies is allowing us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence has significance in science fiction, Artificial Intelligence forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation in machines.
Research in Artificial Intelligence involves making machines automate work that requires intelligent behavior.
Examples include managing, planning, and scheduling, the ability to answer diagnoses and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on offering solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now being used frequently in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the armed forces, as it has been built into many home computer applications and video game software.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom. Quite often a teacher would love to take their students to places where a bus trip isn't possible.
Technology offers a solution with virtual field trips. Students can look at artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina plan a website about their trip to the State Capital; the website is remodelled every year, but old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with messy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer is beginning to strive to improve writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces pupils to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to feed the audience's interest inspires pupils to be capable and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can "empower students to become more analytical and critical; by responding actively to materials on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of other writings as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the captivating, bilingual capital of Canada and features a variety of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered quintessentially Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost wildernesses with no one living in them.
Here's the translation of the Welsh sentence: For a comparison that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens of Canada.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in its own right in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or affiliated with France, and are known as luxury beach holiday destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it gained a large foothold in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel, and in the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
She is also helpful for wearing a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences could lead to what they would consider harassment and that it is not uncommon to be followed, to have your arm grabbed, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading centres there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of jewellery, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the town's streets, especially the town center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano as well as Mountain Gorilla tracking, which is among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to travel around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short journey.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poorer town, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main stopping points during the PBS special program Henry Louis Gates, Wonders of the African World.
The city contrasts sharply with other cities in the country, as it has more of an Arab than African influence.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 square km and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered a primary symbol of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the Park.
It could also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either a selection of parks or all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and is what many tourists consider the main hub.
The parade of buildings that forms Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a glittering bar chart made visible by the presence of Victoria Harbour's water.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the shores of Kowloon opposite.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that British colonists seized as their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove area in the world, extending 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland into Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps - they contain some of the last stands of the great jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans encompass an area of 3,850 square kilometers, a third of which is covered with water/marsh areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although the majority, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As buses between areas are often full, you are advised to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil with Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres, it is 378 metres long and has two lanes that are 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian toll booths are also expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was born, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonial period, and it lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Island pound (FKP) and its value is the same as the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, which is located in Stanley across the road from the FIC West shop.
Generally, British pounds are accepted anywhere in the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, it is likely that credit cards will not be accepted, although British and US currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so you should exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold; temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There aren't any specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain received remains more or less the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife.
However tame they may appear, wild oxen, walruses, elk, bears, and almost every large animal is capable of attacking.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep the correct distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so allow them their space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval dispute in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the Mau movement's fight for independence, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the killing of chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches, because it occupies two harbours. The most popular ones are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the wealthy suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches which are sometimes overcrowded, with a good range of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are a number of wines from France available, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you are concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", a cappuccino comes loaded high with cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to any of those causes on the reef are rare.
However, you should take advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish can be found near beaches and river estuaries between October and April north of 1770. They can sometimes be found outside of these times.
Sharks do exist, however they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater Crocodiles do not actively live in the sea; their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveller peace of mind that she will have a place to sleep once she arrives at her destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you might find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, inquiries regarding any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the overwhelming majority of those attending music festivals camp on site, and most attendees consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the events, you'll have to get in early to get a camping spot close to the music.
Although the music on the main stages has finished, remember that there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some campsites have designated camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in winter, you should check the location of the cabin, as going through ice ridges causes a rather awful noise for those who are most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money guests spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drink and entertainment, to keep guests in good spirits, and keep them in the building.
Some venues offer free alcoholic drinks. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and every good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving on high ground or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow to trap you can fall in a very short amount of time.
Visibility can also be reduced by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic usually continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari, in general use, refers to travelling over land to see Africa's stunning wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment will allow for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are shy sometimes and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "wilderness walk", "hiking safari", or even "trekking") involves hiking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympic games, after hosting the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but at the end of March most cancellation policies based on coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympic games were scheduled.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with standard tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help to dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to borrow, even if there isn't one present in the room.
If there's no iron available, or if you don't fancy wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burning).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling water for a minute is enough, in other areas several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have a concern, then you should consider buying your water in a bottle sealed by a company with a good reputation.
Travellers may encounter pests that they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause painful itching, or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, nor dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travellers going to countries with heavy taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often crossing through isolated rural landscapes.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be alert: steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp bends are common.
Posted speed limits are strikingly lower than in previous and subsequent sections - 35-40 mph common (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
Oddly, however, mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the road, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are fatty and varied, similar to those of their neighbour to the south, Austria.
Fruit crumbles are common, with apples cooked into a crumble throughout the year, and cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many baked goods from Germany contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you fancy small but rich pastries, try those called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
Curries can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing a huge variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
However, if it is used without additional qualifications, the term tends to mean the food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Widely available throughout the archipelago now, the Javanese cooking style comprises a collection of simply flavored dishes, and the main flavors favored by Javanese people are peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut palm sugar) and various fragrant spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They offer more stability to the rider but can have safety problems due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot is caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially those from England, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to come off the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and boulders.
Summits boast spectacular views of mountain peaks. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes amongst its endless potential of walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow-covered landscape with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski fanatics," who plan entire vacations around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depict skiers as far back as 5000 BC!
Skiing downhill as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is related to but does not include ski touring or alpine mountaineering, the latter on steep terrain and requiring much stronger skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar walking path.
In good conditions you can travel distances quite a bit further than walking - but you'll rarely get cross-country skiing speeds without heavy wax in groomed trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport controls numerous times.
The Schengen zone, however, works somewhat like one country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints yet.
Similarly, if you obtain a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas to each country that is a member of Schengen separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade goods can be defined as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture associated with the craft is also important to many who have other professions.
Nevertheless, even traditionally, not all Sámi have been involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but have lived from fishing, hunting and the like, and kept reindeer mainly as draught animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern crafts. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
Despite its widespread use, especially among non-Romani people, the word "Gypsy" is considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Romani people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You might also want to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisory documents are a brief summary of the political situation in one country only.
The viewpoints presented are often superficial, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious disruption to society, or loss of human lives.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area as it may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A web search for "Hostile environment course" will likely provide a local company address.
A course will usually cover all the matters discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
Usually, a course will run from 2-5 days and will include role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that deal with survival in the wilderness are common, but publications that deal with war zones are rare.
Travellers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documentation for the return journey home.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender varies.
The readiness of foreign governments to honour these documents is equally varied.
Searches in security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the period after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip current is the flow of water returning from waves breaking off the beach, often in a rip or something similar.
Because of the underwater topography, the returning flow is concentrated in a few deeper spots, and fast currents to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion when trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back isn't any harder than usual.
Try aiming for somewhere you haven't been caught yet, or, depending on your skills and whether anyone has noticed you, you might want to wait to be rescued.
Reverse culture shock comes on faster than culture shock (there's less of a honeymoon period), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who had an easy time adjusting to the new culture sometimes have a particularly difficult time readjusting to their native culture.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and tolerant, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adapt.
It's possible that people don't foresee that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The sound and light show is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is positioned as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are being displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are being illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the largest number of stations, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 kilometers north of the Antarctic Peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where a flooded active volcanic caldera provides a striking natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the Peninsula merge with the plateau, then reappear to form the 360-kilometre Ellsworth Mountains range, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range has Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, peaking at Mount Vinson which is 4892 m high.
In remote locations, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone does not generally replace a mobile phone, as you must be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions with remote data and voice needs.
Your local phone service provider should be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
Travelling and learning is an increasingly popular choice for those planning a gap year.
This is particularly popular among school leavers, as it allows them to take a gap year before going to university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, registering for a year abroad course can improve your chances of progressing to higher education back in your homeland.
Usually there is a tuition fee to register in these educational programmes.
Finland is a great destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In the islands and lakes, you don't necessarily need a sailboat.
Although the coastal archipelagos and largest lakes are indeed big enough for any sailboat, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
The majority of the various Baltic Cruises include a long stay in St Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of days as well as return and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore using ship-organized excursions you will not need a separate visa (in 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea at all and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different to fears and dislikes of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear based on the unknown or on not being in control.
Shipping companies are paid well for delivering things quickly. Often, time is very important with business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they had sent things by air transport, on some routes it could have taken days to get through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as registered baggage. The airline's regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to pay a large sum of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, this isn't cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy price for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally, there's no point in even looking for discounts on business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a specific core group of flyers who are prepared to pay a lot for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and charge the appropriate fee.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any member state of the United Nations.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Once a city in ancient Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial center, set around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres contrast with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighbouring island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the church cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves over some graves.
It's worth half an hour to go for a walk around the interesting village.
To the north and within easy reach is the very romantic and interesting town of Sintra, which was made famous to foreigners after a laudatory account of its splendours by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb Bus 403 travels to Sintra regularly, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit Our Lady of Fatima Shrine (Sanctuary), a world-famous place for Marian apparitions.
Remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site, as well as a site of almost immeasurable significance to a substantial proportion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death here, Jews and non-Jews alike.
You should treat the site with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti into structures.
Catalan and Spanish are the official languages of Barcelona. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are displayed in Catalan only because it has been established by law as the first official language.
And yet, Spanish is widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the Metro are made in Catalan only, but unplanned disruptions are announced in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a bad reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to be on your best behaviour, acting like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will make getting around a good deal easier.
The abrupt manners of the people of Paris will quickly disappear if you show some basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily wooded, mainly with beech, spruce and pine trees, and includes a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils and varying altitude levels.
The area is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and capercaillie can be found there, as well as many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts below the knees and have something covering their shoulders, as well.
Most of the monasteries provide cloaks for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Along the same lines, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance but those clothes are not washed after every user so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple, popular lunch, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any accompaniments available such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Every name, alongside the word Sie for you, starts every time with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be argued that it makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to identify whether a verb or an adjective is being used in a nominalized form.
Pronunciation is quite easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly the way they are written.
The main letters to look out for are c and g, as the way they are pronounced varies depending on the vowel that follows.
Also, make sure you pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means cart.
Persian grammar is relatively easy and consistent overall.
Therefore, reading this grammar book would help you understand a lot about Persian grammar and understand expressions better.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish might jump to the conclusion that Portuguese is close enough that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually defunct today and are used as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution was not as much of a problem in their heyday as it is today, they were usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to reach than those built in the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms, or hanami, has been an element of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where the plum blossom was the flower of choice.
In Japan, the emperor would hold the first cherry blossom parties only for himself and other members of the nobility around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also get you thrown out, without discussion.
Singapore is an exceptionally safe place to be in general and very easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything after arriving.
But having been located in the "high tropics" a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to cope with heat (all the time) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure the bus you intend to take is going to Hebron and not just the nearby Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to base your holiday on.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a river cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or take a boat along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular walking and cycling paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it celebrates the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the holiday traditions are also followed by non-believers living in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake in some open space to see the dawn breaking.
There are Christian theological explanations for this tradition of course, but it could be a pre-Christian Spring and Fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning to celebrate at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally reached the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
As the population of the areas is sparse, and light pollution therefore not often a problem, you will also be able to see the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners might be used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues call each other by their surnames or by job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is essential, emphasizing group effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Employees often have to get their superiors' approval for any decision they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions unquestioningly.
