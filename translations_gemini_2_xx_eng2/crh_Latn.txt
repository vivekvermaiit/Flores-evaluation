This not only confirms the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details such as color and three-dimensional arrangement that fossil finds typically cannot.
Scientists say that the upper part of this animal's fur is chestnut-brown, and the lower part is pale or carotenoid-colored.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Researchers concluded that because dinosaurs did not have the well-developed rachis (shaft) of feathers, called a vane, but did possess other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – the vane emerged later in feather evolution from these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were used for display or thermoregulation, not flight. Researchers noted that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, it shows adult feathers, not, for example, the down of a chick.

In France, voting is a fairly low-tech process: voters go into a booth and mark their chosen candidate on a pre-printed paper ballot, then put it in an envelope.
After the voter's identity is verified by government officials, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral laws codify electoral processes in a serious manner.
Starting from 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that the ballots inside do not have envelopes, and that besides the envelopes of proportionally counted and authorized voters, no other envelopes are added at the beginning of the vote count.
Candidates can send their representatives to monitor every stage of the process. In the evenings, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, according to certain rules.

In the other race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting group with a total time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 slower than the ninth-place Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Among women, four downhill skiers from the sitting group were unable to complete their runs, and 45 out of 117 athletes failed to win a prize in the giant slalom.
The police of Madhya Pradesh state returned the stolen laptop and cell phone.
D.K. Arya, the deputy chief inspector, said: "We have apprehended five people who violated the honor of the Swiss woman, and seized her cell phone and laptop."
The accused are - Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused came to court with their faces covered.
Despite there being 3 people in the house when the car crashed, none of them were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
By the time emergency services rescued the driver from the red Audi TT, the road where the accident occurred was closed.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been at Edinburgh Sheriff Court since that time, accused of murdering his son.
He remains in custody awaiting trial in connection with the indictment, but because of its widespread official publication, each witness's testimony may be compromised.
This is a situation that frequently occurs in other countries of Great Britain, but the Scottish judicial authorities operate differently, and the courts view the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Dundee University professor Pamela Ferguson says, "Journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line by publishing photos of suspects, etc."
Generally, the Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecuting cases, informed journalists that there would be no further comment, at least until the verdict was delivered.
According to leaked information, the document will be about discussions regarding borders, where it is desired that Palestine be restored to the borders that existed before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Reportedly, the situation of the city of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan Valley are among other topics.
After Israel demanded a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement was signed, the Palestinian Authority agreed to this military presence lasting only five years.
The shooters participating in the pest control test were under the supervision of rangers because the test was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
Within the framework of the partnership between NPWS and the Australian Sport Shooting Association (NSW), qualified volunteers were hired through the association's av program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, who temporarily served as the director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation received comprehensive instruction in safety techniques and preparation.
Yesterday Martelli swore in the new Provisional Electoral Council (PEC) consisting of nine members.
This is Martellini's fifth ATP Challenger in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former Cabinet of Ministers, within the framework of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the mass protests that began against the government in October.
Sometimes, fierce discontent was caused by the fact that the elections, which were supposed to be held in 2011, were not held.
Nearly 60 incidents of overheating involving faulty iPods, which caused six fires and minor burns to four people, have been recorded.
According to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan, it is aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, ITSN announced that Apple had informed them about 34 additional overheating incidents, which they called "not serious."
In response, the ministry called Apple's report being late "truly regrettable."
The earthquake occurred in Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands reported that no destruction was recorded in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus with tourists from Hong Kong in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took people hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on the tourists with an M16 rifle.
A few hostages were rescued, and now it has been confirmed that at least six people were killed.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released ahead of schedule, like Filipino photographers.
Later, when an old woman wanted to go to the toilet, the photographers took her place. Mendoza is shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He received his midwifery training and started working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Maalde begins to research preterm birth in his spare time.
His research shows that hormone administration accelerates the maturation of the fetal lung.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that government investigators had found both "black boxes" of the helicopter self-propelled gun.
Fellow artisans also expressed gratitude to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a two-moon night. On a unique night like her. She was a powerful woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels explained, "Luna was as crazy as me... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place now."
In a survey conducted before the 2010 federal election, the number of people out of 1400 participants who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of voters agree with the idea, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Key points of the survey: 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic soon, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100 and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Unity Games, but after his complaints, his health raises doubts.
I can't take painkillers because they are prohibited during the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, professor of mathematics and computer science at Central Missouri University, discovered the largest known prime number.
The discovery was announced on Tuesday after several people confirmed it using various equipment and programs in early February.
Comets were likely a source of water to Earth, along with organic matter that could create and sustain life.
Scientists are trying to understand how planets formed, especially how Earth formed, from comets colliding with Earth a long time ago.
At the beginning of this year, Cuomo became governor at the age of 53 and last month passed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and foolishness".
It is predicted that he will be a candidate for president in 2016.
The FAA confirms that NextGen is a system that allows aircraft to take shorter routes, save millions of liters of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
Satellite technology is used instead of the old ground-based radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to track aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
Shuttle transportation will not be available, surface metro trains will not stop at Wembley, and there is no car parking or parking spaces at the stadium.
Due to fears of a lack of passenger transport, it was predicted that the game would be held behind closed doors, without the team's fans.
A study published in the journal Science on Wednesday reported the formation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Island.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that only two generations of the new species have formed, but there was a perception that this process was longer due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's medium ground finch, Geopiza fortes birds, and the large cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in various ways. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be squeezed into thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be embedded into leaves or twisted.
It can be thinned very much and applied to other metals. It can be thinned so much that sometimes they would decorate hand-made pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts" with it.
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) a chemical substance is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical substance under investigation.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean, damp hands, shape them into a ball and squeeze.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, it will attack, and create a type of harm.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of a sewage system have been found in the homes of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also toilets. Sometimes, in Roman civilization, toilets were part of public baths, where men and women would enter as a mixed group.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
Having received the call for a companion in the universe, send it down immediately.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere changes part of our light and vision.
A very large rocket, 100 feet in height, is needed to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in an unbelievable way. The greatest thing done for us by the wheel is the possibility of easy and fast transportation.
It brought us trains, cars, and many other means of transport.
Underneath them, there are medium-sized cats that hunt medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are very small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success secret is niche understanding, which is a specific action taken by each cat that doesn't allow them to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three adult male lions and up to thirty females and their cubs.
Families, traditionally interconnected, form large families consisting of brothers and sisters.
Lion prides behave like packs of wolves or dogs (but not other big cats), animals that strangely resemble lions in their behavior and treat their prey with savagery.
The tiger, being a strong athlete, can climb (although not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
Tigers belong to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four cats have the ability to roar.
A leopard's growl doesn't resemble a lion's full-throated roar, but rather sounds more like a growled, shouted phrase.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all of the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots find their prey by tracking the scent of their urine, smelling the places where they have been.
Using night vision devices, they can see very well in the dark and move stealthily. When ocelots hunt, they blend in with their surroundings, and then pounce on their prey.
When a small group of creatures (a small population) separates from its original source population (for example, when they cross a mountain range or valley that they can easily return across, or when they migrate to a new island), they often find themselves in a new environment unlike the previous one.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, therefore the new population may need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than was previously necessary.
The actual population hasn't changed, they still need the same adaptations as before.
A new population that gradually adapts to its new environment begins to resemble other populations less and less.
Eventually, after thousands and even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process, which means the emergence of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale.
Plants produce nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis. In addition, they also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make our clothes from plants. Most of the produce we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not live.
Mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were filled with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and he also had an extra set of teeth on his palate, which indicated that nothing that came before him would survive.
Even though we're not sure, it's possible to guess that it had a forked tongue. Its food consisted of shelled frogs, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a monster.
It attacked everything that went into the water as well; it cannot even be compared to a gigantic dinosaur like a T. Rex.
Although many of the Romans' dishes are familiar to us, they also had unusual and unconventional foods, including dishes prepared from wild boar, peacock, stork, and rodents like dormice.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals sitting on stools, wealthy gentlemen liked to hold communal feasts where they ate and drank while reclining.
Among the ancient Roman dishes, there were no foods that had been brought to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, there was no corn, no tomato, no potato, and no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple, considered a house of god, for each of their gods.
People sacrificed to their gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of their gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard, followed by an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter and leave.
In some places, special towers in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built next to temples.
The summit of the mountain was a sanctuary dedicated to God.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house was not so important.
The Jewish family spent most of their life outdoors.
The women were cooking food in the courtyard; instead of shops, there were open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no great forests, and for this reason, wood was very expensive.
Greenland's population is not large. Scandinavian sagas tell that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for killing someone, and then, traveling westward, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite the discoveries, it turns out that Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Despite the name "Scandinavia," there are many differences between the population, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think that the treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But this is not true. Even if something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence is written the phrase "Original copy of the Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". This text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is clear that this large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for preservation in the earliest period of its life.
Therefore, this marking should only be added as a symbol.
The D-Day landing and subsequent battles liberated the northern part of France, but the south was still not free.
It was administered by the "Vichy" French. These were the French who signed a peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French Forces liberated southern France and headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a distinct culture, a society, characterized by a large group of people living and working together.
The word "civilization," derived from the Latin word civilis, expresses the meaning of citizenship; it shares roots with the Latin word civis, meaning "citizen," and is taken from the word civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state," which to some extent defines the size of a society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. Civilization implies the passing of knowledge through several generations, the leaving of a continuous cultural trace, and its fair distribution.
Small civilizations often disappear without leaving behind the necessary historical evidence and cannot be recognized as fully-fledged civilizations.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states first formed a central government for themselves, the only component of which was the Congress established according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, nor did it have a national executive or judicial branch, so to ensure the execution of all acts, Congress was forced to rely on state governments, which in most cases were uncooperative.
He also did not have the right to abolish its tax laws and interstate prices.
Before the articles were amended, the consent of all states had to be obtained, but because the states viewed the central government with great unseriousness, their representatives also rarely attended.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, shares second place among the most successful teams in the world, and in 2006 it won first place in the FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, motorsports, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Italians participate in international games and Olympic competitions, and winter sports are most popular in the northern regions.
Japan owns approximately 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the world's seventh-largest island country!
Thanks to its cluster/group of owned islands, Japan is traditionally referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical point of view.
Taiwan's history begins in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, attempting a diversification in local grain production by hiring Chinese workers to work in rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, the military forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) brought the western and northern coasts of Taiwan under their control, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures such as the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were built to better show tourists what it actually looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu was rebuilt, and restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the most widespread photo format in the world is 35 millimeters, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
Today it is still being produced, but more importantly, the ratios of its sides are maintained by digital camera image sensor formats.
Despite appearing small, the 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is equal to 3:2.
Many known formats (for example, the APS format family) have an aspect ratio that is equal to or close to this.
The rule of thirds, which is often misused and misunderstood, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
It shows that the most effective place for the main object to be drawn is the intersection point of the lines that divide the picture into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church is brought under control.
Despite differences in language and customs, the Christian religion has united European states for more than a thousand years.
His power, which enveloped everywhere, affected everyone, from the king to the common man.
The necessity of using wealth to reduce conflict and poverty is one of the main postulates of Christianity, and church funds exist primarily for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church has been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money raises doubts for many people about whether this faith is being practiced as it should be.
Without waiting, once military actions began, England initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated general international law, which has been codified by various international agreements over the last two hundred years.
To prevent any ship from entering all parts of the ocean, England mined international waters, creating danger even for neutral ships.
Although the resistance shown against this tactic was limited, Germany expected similar resistance to the unrestricted submarine warfare it was conducting.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing views of citizens and the majority of countries.
After witnessing the horror and brutality of war during World War I, nations tried to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York.
He arrives at Thomas Edison's place in the USA with 4 cents belonging to him, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation given by Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor).
Ancient China had a unique way of representing its distinct historical periods; each period of development or ruling family in China was shown as a separate dynasty.
Additionally, unstable states divided among various dynasties were common. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Qin dynasties.
In those times, fierce battles were constantly taking place among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms, one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, saw thousands of people fighting and dying to sit atop the highest point of the grand palace in Xi'an.
The adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the idea that the country belongs not to a single ruler but to the people, all have many social and political effects.
Furthermore, after the revolution, trades and professions were opened to all male candidates who allowed ambitious and successful people to achieve success.
It may also be related to the military, because the military ranking was now based on caliber instead of being based on class.
The French Revolution also inspired many working-class representatives in other countries under oppression to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He would go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain "Nur" (light) for contemplation.
This cave, preserved to this day, provides a very vivid depiction of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Even if you knew it existed, it wouldn't be easy to find. Once you enter the cave, you find yourself in complete isolation.
Besides the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains, nothing else can be seen. When you are inside the cave, you can see or hear very little that belongs to this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has survived to this day.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many large pyramids built in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead consists of several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is considered the largest), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and the smaller pyramids, tombs, and many chapels were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upward bow" sign looks like a V, while the "downward bow" looks like a caret or a square that is not open on the bottom.
The top part means you need to start from the tip and bend the bow; the bottom part means you need to start from the bow grip (the place where your hand holds the bow) and draw the bow.
The upper string, as a rule, is softer; the lower string, on the other hand, produces a stronger and more energetic sound.
Don't hesitate to add your own markings, but don't forget that the markings placed on the arc were placed for musical reasons, so they must be treated with respect.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Theresa and four-year-old Louis Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, due to the harassment of a crowd of market women.
In the carriage, surrounded by a mob of people shouting threats at the king and queen, they made their way back to Paris.
The crowd made the king and queen open the carriage windows.
In which one of the moments a member of the herd, in front of the frightened queen, was waving the head of a royal guard who was killed in Versailles.
The military expenses of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves.
To cover a large portion of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street investment banks, they were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial administration.
Of course, the super-profits obtained from the continuous exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the main income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
These events are called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
Early Middle Ages was the predecessor of the High Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, according to general opinion, ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that, in practice, encompasses a large area of ideas, from the neutral assumption that the development of technology or the technological imperative is deeply connected to human destiny, to the strict acceptance that it is connected through scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two main ideas: that the development of technologies largely follows a path independent of cultural or political influence, and that technologies, in turn, exhibit inherent "effects" that are not socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the emergence of the automobile led to the development of paved roads.
A purely national road network is not economically viable for the small number of cars, therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the discovery of new technologies in healthcare services to restore injured bodies to health.
Romanticism has a significant element of cultural determinism, originating from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes personality, and over time, customs and culture associated with this geography arise, and they, being in harmony with the society's place, are better than laws dictated in a vacuum.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was also considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of splendor began around 400 BCE and lasted until 1100 CE.
His status declined in the 12th century due to the fact that crusaders returned with spoils more valuable than the silk and spices offered by the Byzantine markets.
The transfer of the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris had already taken place at that time.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, urban fabric was under the strong influence of Byzantine culture in the east.
Only on slow vineyard roads is it possible for western styles to lag behind by 25-30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own royal style. One of the major events of that time was that as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is a type of farming where the farmer and their family produce enough food to meet their needs.
Auxiliary farming is such a simple, organic practice that it uses the theft that has been preserved and belongs to these regions in conjunction with successive sowing or other relatively simple methods.
Throughout history, the majority of farmers were solely engaged in agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries today.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel limited by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Supercultures can differ based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The features that define a superculture separately can be a combination of linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender, geographical, or other factors.
Members of a subculture express their belonging using a distinctive and representative style, which consists of fashion, manner of behavior, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to invoke several cases involving such unfortunate children who, growing up as a result of neglect, misfortune, or violence perpetrated by their parents, were not socialized by adults.
Such children are called 'kiyikleşken' or kiyik. Some kiyikleşken children were abandoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the parents' unfavorable view of the child's severe mental or physical disabilities led to the abandonment of the child.
Children who have become wild have likely experienced severe abuse or trauma directed at the child before being abandoned or running away.
Others, according to those who confirmed it, were raised by animals; some, as they said, lived on their own in the wild.
If a child is raised entirely by animals rather than humans, they will exhibit behavior (within physical limitations) that closely resembles the conduct of a specific animal that cared for them, fearing or disregarding humans.
As instruction based on play should make it easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding can be defined not as a teaching method, but as assistance that provides support to people who are going through a new learning experience, using a new computer program, or starting a new project.
Bridges can be both virtual and real, that is, an anchor – like the paperclip guy in Microsoft Office – is a kind of bridge.
Virtual tutors are built into software and are designed to ask students questions about tasks they cannot perform independently, tell them what to do, and explain.
Children end up in adoptive families for various reasons, ranging from lack of care and cruel treatment to forced removal.
Even though a child shouldn't grow up in an environment where there is no upbringing, care, and education, it can happen.
We accept foster care as a safe environment for these children.
Our patronage upbringing system must ensure safe homes, loving guardians, stable education, and reliable medical services.
It is assumed that the adoptive family provides the children with everything they lacked in the orphanage they were previously taken from.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the internet lead to additional measurements from the perspective of user engagement and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important reasons for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
When investigating the audience's resistance to websites, Eighmey and McCord identified "personal involvement" and "relationship maintenance" as new aspects of motivation.
The use of video analysis led to important discoveries in interpreting expressions - facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it can be determined whether a person is deceiving by correctly interpreting statements.
Oliver Sacks showed in his work 'The President's Speech' that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage, nevertheless, have the ability to highly value sincerity.
He even suggests that such suggestive abilities related to a person's behavior are also characteristic of animals, for example, yard dogs.
Twenty centuries of research have shown that heredity has two sides: hidden and expressed.
Blackmail adds new genealogical transformations, while elections remove them from the pool of expressed transformations.
Separation and integration exchange places back and forth between two poles of transformations in every generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for primates with human-like low-quality diets to satisfy their needs in groups due to the available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to comply with this requirement leads to serious consequences, namely: growth suppression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
Acorns were the most easily accessible plant resource, being present in leaves and pods, but for primates like us, they are difficult to assimilate unless prepared.
On the contrary, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a large amount of protein that contains all essential amino acids in the required proportions.
Considering the aforementioned, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved the "matter of right" roughly in the same way that chimpanzees do in the savanna today.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully waking up during a normal sleep cycle and falling back asleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
It is easier to achieve this by using a relatively slow alarm clock to come to your senses without fully waking you up.
If you let it be known that you tend to snooze your alarm, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other methods based on awakening involve forcing a person to get up to urinate, often involving the consumption of a large amount of fluid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep.
The amount of a person's inner world is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The less tension there is, the more vitality is found. Every person has the power to possess complete peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our personal tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it is expanded with the Mahayana path of love and many methods from Indian yoga.
Generally, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deities. Through the visualization of various deities, energetic pathways are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the understanding of enlightenment becomes real.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war ended, the clash of systems, interests, and cultures led to a deterioration in relations between the countries.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last on duty for 40 years and, in reality, be carried out with the help of puppet armies on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been breached, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize on the Romanian bridgehead.
It would be correct to say that these plans became obsolete at the same time that the Red Army of the Soviet Union, with more than 800,000 soldiers, invaded the eastern regions of Poland after violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other bilateral and unilateral international agreements, creating the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using ships to transport cargo is the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
The task of naval forces, as usual, is to guarantee that your country maintains its ability to move its own people and goods, while hindering your enemy's ability to move their own people and goods.
One of the most prominent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, mainly using U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies suffered a defeat, Germany could have conquered Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient civilizations and tribes kept them in order to easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Traditionally, domestic goats were kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often watched over by children or teenagers acting as shepherds in a broad sense. These herding methods are still used today.
Minecarts were made in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the wagons consisted only of parallel planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to move faster and carry larger loads, even on the somewhat rougher roads of that time.
However, it became clear that putting iron pieces on top of the flights little by little would be more effective.
This was reduced to a simple thing, but it led to an increase in the wear of the wooden brake blocks of the iron wagons.
Finally, wooden bridges were replaced with iron bridges. In 1867, the first full iron rails appeared.
The first known type of transportation was walking; humans have been walking upright since the emergence of Homo Erectus ("meaning 'upright man'") about two million years ago.
Their ancestors, like Australopithecus, did not walk fully upright.
Despite Sahelanthropus walking on two legs seven million years ago, bipedal specializations were found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, join ecological movements, and even become activists to reduce future disasters to a certain extent.
In most cases, this resembles symptomatic treatment. But if we don't just want to achieve a temporary solution, then we need to find the cause of the problems and eliminate them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed greatly as a result of the scientific and technological progress of humanity, that the population has increased significantly, and that, due to humanity's sedentary lifestyle, the problems have become even more numerous.
On July 4th, after being adopted by Congress, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing house.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made in one night, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the declaration took place on July 8th at Independence Hall by John Nixon.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his armies in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
Dunlap's still visible 25-column page is the oldest surviving copy of the document. The original manuscript has not survived.
Currently, most paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and live even today. We call them birds.
Most people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and they fly.
But even still, birds have many things that remind one of dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today rely on the manipulation of data encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, that is, it can be 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Food poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are too general to allow for an immediate diagnosis.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container that held medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions for a specific poison.
The term "weevil" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this order of insects.
This term comes from the ancient acquaintance of humans with bedbugs, which are insects well adapted to parasitizing people.
Both booklice and bedbugs are nidicolous, meaning they are accustomed to living in the nest or dwelling of their hosts.
Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known in the United States, making it a major neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple can decide that raising children is not in their interest or in the best interest of their children.
These couples can choose an adoption plan.
Upon adoption, the child's biological parents are deprived of their parental rights so that the adoptive couple can be the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to learn how the world is built by using the scientific method. This method essentially validates many scientific studies.
However, this method is not the only one: experiments, and an experiment is a test used to formulate one or more hypotheses, asking questions and conducting observations also validate scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on classical texts and especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language diminished, the West was severed from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are to a very significant extent dependent on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production with the help of biological clocks.
Circadian rhythms, which are not a simple response to external environmental signals, have been recorded in many living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue their free-running period even in the absence of external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main hypotheses regarding DNA being the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, radioactively labeling either the DNA of the phage with phosphorus or the protein of the phage with sulfur.
Mutations can have various consequences depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells or not.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cells to disappear or lead to cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscapes, along with the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about ecosystems.
Visiting, photographing, and researching orangutans in Borneo can be given as an example.
Every morning, people drive from small provincial towns to their workplaces, while others, whose workplaces are already in the place they have left, pass by them.
On this mobile transportation route, everyone is somehow dependent on a transportation system based on personal cars and continues to maintain it.
Now, science shows that this heavy carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of its stable states that sustained human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone can participate in public life and use transportation systems. However, almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about things like water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do delivery systems generate such complaints, why do they not work every day? Maybe the delivery engineers are inexperienced? Or is there something bigger going on?
Transportation flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
It is a pity that studying traffic flow is difficult, because it is impossible to predict a driver's behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
It is good that drivers behave within a fairly consistent range; thus, the delivery flows have a logical sequence and can be mathematically shown with certainty.
To better visualize the delivery flow, relationships were established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These connections help in the planning, design, and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. The ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
A significant advantage of many insects is their ability to fold their wings backwards along their body.
This gives them a greater opportunity to choose smaller places to hide from predators.
Today, as always, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and flies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Although some consider him intelligent, the majority believed the opposite, namely that the Sun moves around the Earth - in other words, the Sun (and even other stars) revolved around the Earth.
This seems logical, since we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It discharges 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon, sometimes being six miles wide, is also the widest river in the world.
20% of the water flowing from river systems to the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The Great Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, none of them could surpass the size of the Giza pyramids and the technical perfection of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were already amazed by the thousand-year-old monuments of their predecessors even back then.
The population of the Vatican is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its laws and official announcements.
Italian is also a daily language used by the majority of those working in the country, while Latin is traditionally used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People knew about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because all of them could be found naturally in nature and were relatively easy to extract with the help of very simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, surmised that everything is composed of either one or more elements, specifically resulting from the mixture of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It seems that matter has four states (at the same time): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also supposed that it was converted into new materials to create what we see.
A mineral resource is actually a mixture of two or more minerals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered minerals. Of course, there are also minerals like silver and gold.
You can also have access to mineral springs that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in space is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that they can't be imagined, it's possible to fit trillions of them into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil, since its appearance, has remained a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing tools, the use of pencils has become increasingly rare.
People write their statements on computer screens, no longer even approaching a drawing board, let alone clinging to one.
When something new appears, one can only guess how the keyboard layout will turn out.
A hydrogen bomb works on the principle that a great deal of energy is required to combine many protons and neutrons into one nucleus.
It's like pulling a heavy cart uphill. When the nucleus splits, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they are prone to decay even if they are undisturbed or virtually undisturbed.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the Earth's crust is 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the mole (black dot), and even thicker on the yayla (mountain pastures).
Because the bark is thinner, there may be more resin closer by. It's also easier for the resin to rise to the top.
Motivational theories are focused on exploring what compels or attracts people to engage in certain activities.
These theories posit that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow toward adulthood.
These theories investigate how people are forced to do the things that certain individuals want them to do, and how certain things around them force them to do or not to do certain things.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, when managers start managing their former colleagues, two types of behavior can emerge. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
These leaders struggle with issues such as making unpopular decisions, imposing disciplinary punishments, evaluating work, delegating tasks, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the fan, he transforms into an unrecognizable state, feeling that he needs to change everything the team has built and shape it as he desires.
Ultimately, the coach is responsible for the team's success or failure.
Such behavior often leads to misunderstandings between leaders and other members of the team.
Virtual teams possess the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are also subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as points of contact for their immediate physical teams.
They traditionally have more autonomy than other team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which local managers may not understand.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also an integral part of a virtual team.
"The Invisible Team" is a team with a leader to whom all members are subordinate. The Invisible Team sets standards for each member of the team.
Why would an organization want to go through a process as time-consuming as creating a trained organization? One of the goals of organizational learning concepts in their practical application is renewal.
Creativity and mastery can be shown when all functional units of an organization efficiently use available resources.
Ultimately, a team working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to the creation of a new innovative process that will satisfy the customer's need.
In order for an organization to be an innovative organization, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Encel (2006) suggests that the Continuum approach is a method used to help an organization reach a higher level of operational excellence.
Neurobiological data provides concrete evidence in the theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, they narrow the field of research and make it more specific.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of injuries, such as brain injury, concussion, trauma, and swelling, affect movement and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study the previously unseen structure and processes of the brain.
This, in turn, provides us with a great deal of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) is a strong element of science fiction, AI has become a very important computer field dealing with movement within a machine, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence is related to machines designed to automate tasks that require intelligent action.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, along with handwriting, voice and face recognition, as well as the ability to diagnose customer issues and answer their questions.
Such things have turned into separate sciences aimed at solving real-life problems.
Currently, expert systems are frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military affairs, and have also been incorporated into some home computer and video game programs.
Field trips conducted outside the city are an integral part of every educational process. Often, a teacher wants to take students to places that are impossible to reach by bus.
Technology helps solve problems through virtual tours. Students can see museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or view fine art while sitting in the classroom.
Participating in a common virtual journey, analyzing a journey, and then sharing the experience with future classes is a very good way.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina prepare a website about their trips to the state capital, and every year the website is updated and changed, but the old versions remain available on the internet to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help students develop their writing. Although students usually start the experience of running a blog with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of a reader usually changes the situation.
As usual, because students are the most critical readers, the blogger tries to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, writing a blog "forces students to be more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to feed the reader's curiosity inspires students to be smart and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires students to collaborate and encourages traditional education to extend beyond the school day.
The correct use of blogs allows students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can establish their own positions through the works of others and express their point of view on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and has a number of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Towards the south, there's Niagara Falls, and towards the north, there's the untouched beauty of Muskoka and other places.
All of these things, and many more, are noted as what would make Ontario be considered by foreigners as belonging to Canada.
In the vast northern areas, very few people live, and some are wild natural regions with almost no inhabitants.
A population comparison that surprises most people is this: There are more African Americans living in the US than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the coast of East Africa.
Undoubtedly, when talking about wildlife, Madagascar is the largest and most unique continent.
Most of the small islands are either an independent state or famous and magnificent beach resorts affiliated with France.
Arabs also brought the religion of Islam to these lands, and it spread widely, as in the Comoros Islands and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route that led from Europe to India.
Semet is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: Regardless of their actual marital status, all female travelers are advised to say they are married.
Wearing a ring has its benefits (as long as it's not the kind that's meant to look expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as harassment, and that harassing them, grabbing their arms, etc., is not a simple matter.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to step back (it's not good to assume that cultural differences don't exist!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids, who named it Anfa.
The Portuguese rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca after destroying it, but they abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Maghreb Sultan rebuilds the city under the name Dar-ul Badya, while Spanish merchants, who built trading warehouses there, call it Casablanca.
Casablanca is considered one of the least attractive places in the Maghreb for shopping.
Around the old Medina, it is very easy to find places selling jewelry, pottery, terry products, hookahs, and a variety of traditional Moroccan items, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano in Goma destroyed and buried a large part of the city's streets, especially the center.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, before visiting places outside of Goma, it is necessary to learn about the situation with the ongoing military operations in the North Kivu province.
The city is a base both for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and for watching mountain gorillas in Africa in the cheapest way.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The local price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
"Timbuktu," along with its relative inaccessibility, began to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Despite the fact that Timbuktu has become an attractive tourist center with its reputation and has an airport, it is a poor city today.
In 1990, it was included in the list of World Heritage Sites that are in danger due to the sand threat.
This is a key stop on Henry Louis Gates' PBS program "Africa's Great Civilizations".
The city contrasts sharply with the other cities of the country, as it possesses more of an Arab character than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and stretches along the Crocodile River on its southern border.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each of which harbors a unique wildlife nature.
It is one of the most important places to see in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all other South African national parks, a daily conservation and park entrance fee is charged here.
Additionally, it might be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access to individual parks in South Africa or to all national parks of the Republic of South Africa.
The name of Hong Kong comes from the name of Hong Kong Island, and it is considered a major attraction for many tourists.
It is possible to compare Hong Kong's skyline, a parade of buildings, to a clear, glittering line diagram thanks to the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
A large part of Hong Kong Island's urban built-up area is located on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the land that English colonists claimed as their own, and so if you're looking for proof of the colonial past of these lands, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and India, is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest.
Sundarbans was included in UNESCO's World Heritage List. The part of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, these are not just ordinary mangrove swamps - here, the last dense jungle thickets that once covered the Ganges plain have been preserved.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², with about a third of it covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and according to some estimates, it is currently home to 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Even though buses operate from the intercity bus station throughout the day (facing the river), most buses, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is recommended to purchase tickets a few days in advance for intercity buses, as they are often full.
Small comfortable and reliable Japanese Coaster Buses operate in the majority of regions.
Shared taxis are the fastest and most convenient way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River and connects the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
It has two towers 83 meters tall, a length of 378 meters, and a width of 3.50 meters, with two lanes.
The right-angled opening under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and the bridge was not open for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, after the completion of the construction of the Brazilian customs points.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group who lived primarily in eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and engaging in rudimentary agriculture.
In the Chaco region, other indigenous peoples lived who, like the Guaycurú and Payaguá, subsisted on hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called "Province of the Indians," emerged as a result of the conflict between Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous population.
The Spanish initiate a period of colonialism that lasts for three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve a large part of its identity with its native nature.
Argentina is famous for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The year's biggest competition takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
It is possible to see small competitions and matches in other seasons of the year as well.
Information about news related to competitions and tickets that can be purchased for polo matches can be obtained from the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of Folkland is the Folkland pound (FKP), pegged to the British pound (GBP) at parity.
You can only exchange the money at the island's only bank, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound is accepted everywhere on the island, as usual, while Stanley also accepts credit cards and US dollars.
While English and US currency might be accepted on remote islands, credit cards probably won't be; ask the owners beforehand to understand what payment method is likely to be acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange foreign currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the island.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; temperatures above +30°C are frequently encountered in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: it rarely drops below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make the air feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons here: the amount of precipitation remains approximately at the same level throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the deer is wild by nature, so it should neither be fed nor disturbed.
According to park authorities, it is necessary to maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals.
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain the necessary distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space to move freely.
Besides that, don't forget that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid taking or cooking odorous foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu, and its population is approximately 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
Liman was the site of a military naval clash in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and England refused to leave the port.
Apart from one British cruiser, all the ships sank. About 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, its chief leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, was killed as a result of a peaceful gathering in the city.
Because Auckland is located on two harbours, there are many beaches there. The most popular ones are in three regions.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Aman-Aman has safe, sandy beaches ideal for swimming, and many are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitematā Harbour and in the prestigious city suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are crowded family beaches with many shops lined up along the coast sometimes. It is safe to sunbathe.
The local beer called "Number One" isn't strong, but it's pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There's a lot of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wines travel even better.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you have concerns, you can easily find bottled water.
Australians like the idea of "flat white" coffee. Short black coffee - "espresso", cappuccino is served with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate conforms to Belgian standards. Juices are expensive, but excellent.
Rafting trips can be done throughout the year, and injuries related to any of these reasons on the raft are rare.
But in any case, listen to the recommendations of the leaders, follow all the signs, and be attentive to safety instructions.
Box jellyfish are encountered north of 1770 from October to April, near beaches and around river mouths. Sometimes they can appear outside these time limits as well.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and stay away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean; their main habitat is river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Guarantee in advance that the traveler will have a place to sleep upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies often make agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation like camping through a travel agency.
Travel agencies typically offer all-inclusive packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even flights and hotels.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to process other documents (such as a visa) for your destination.
Any changes or requests should be directed to the travel agency first, and not directly to the hotel.
During some festivals, a large portion of those participating in music festivals decide to camp in the same place, and many of them consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be at the center of the action, you need to arrive early to find a spot close to the music at the camp.
Even though music might be finished in the main venues, the festival could also have places that continue playing music until midnight.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
When crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the ice breaking can create a quite frightening noise due to those affected by it being very impressive.
St. Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city. Passengers on cruises do not need to obtain a visa (check the conditions).
Casinos, as usual, put all their efforts into minimizing the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and finding the exits can be difficult.
To ensure the guests are comfortable and stay longer, we traditionally offer special dishes, drinks, and entertainment.
Some casinos offer free alcohol. However, since intoxication negatively affects the mind, all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice, or low temperatures.
Driving on roads covered with ice and snow is slippery, and you can't drive like you would on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time for you to get stuck in your car.
Visibility can worsen due to snow falling or drifting, or even from condensation or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, in many countries icy and snowy weather is natural, and in most cases transport continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa, and is the main highlight for many visitors.
The popular word "safari" also means a trip abroad to see the amazing African wildlife in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, often approach cars, and standard equipment will give you the opportunity to look after them well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can sometimes be afraid, and you can see them better with binoculars.
Bushwhacking (also called "brushing," "hiking safari," or "hiking") consists of excursions that last a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some competitions will take place in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo already hosted the 1964 Games, but will become the only Asian city to have welcomed two Summer Olympics.
If you had booked your plane and accommodation for 2020 before they announced that the Olympic Games were postponed, you might have found yourself in a difficult situation.
The curfew policy changes, but starting from the end of March, due to the coronavirus, the curfews do not work for the July 2020, when the Olympics were supposed to be held.
It is expected that ticket prices for most competitions will be between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, with typical ticket prices up to 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes will help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, even if they aren't in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can use a hair dryer if you have one.
Do not allow the fabric to shrink (this could cause the fabric to become misshapen or at least cause you not to be able to wear it).
There are various methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some regions, boiling water in a minute is enough, while in others, it is necessary to boil it for a few minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you're concerned, you can buy water in sealed bottles from a company called "Clean Water".
Travelers may encounter dangerous animals that they are not familiar with in their regions.

The posted speed limits are quite low compared to the previous and subsequent sections of the road - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than adhering in other situations.
Interestingly, the cell phone signal is better here than in other parts of the road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds region.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria, as in its southern neighbor Austria, they are quite rich and diverse.

Stirrups are a support for the feet hanging on either side of a horse's saddle.
They provide better stability for the rider, but the rider's feet can get caught in them, potentially causing safety issues.
If a rider falls off a horse but their foot remains in the stirrup, and the horse runs, it is possible for the horse to drag them. It is possible to take a number of precautionary measures to reduce such danger.
Firstly, most horsemen in the army wear boots with bows, flat soles, and a rather narrow cut.
Later, some saddles, especially English saddles, have protective flaps that allow the skirt of the saddle to fall away from the rider's skin when a rider falls, preventing the cantle from pulling the skirt backwards.

Kayaking: this activity is also known as kayaking, kayak tourism, and kayak hiking in mountainous areas.
Alpine skiing tourism is related to alpinism, but usually it's not the same; the latter is done on steeper terrains and requires more rigid skis and boots.
Imagine a footpath resembling a ski run.
In good conditions, you can cover slightly longer distances on foot - but unless you're on well-maintained paths without a heavy backpack, you'll hardly achieve the speed of skiing.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but one with a number of independent countries. In normal circumstances, traveling to several countries means having to go through visa and passport checks many times.
However, the Schengen area functions as a single country in this regard.
During your stay in this region, it is possible to cross the borders without passing through passport control points again.
Therefore, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa to each member state of Schengen, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
