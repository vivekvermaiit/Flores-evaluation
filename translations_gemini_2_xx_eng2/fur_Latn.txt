This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already well established, but it also offers details that fossils usually cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top with a light underside, or with carotenoid pigments.
The study also offers information regarding the evolution of plumage in birds.
Given that dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed rachis, but do have other feather characteristics (barbs and barbules), researchers have deduced that the rachis probably developed later in the evolution of these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but to regulate temperature or for display. The researchers have suggested that, even though the tail is from a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.

Luminosity and rotation are used to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for should have been caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, thus determining the tides, so too does the Stradalbe exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter has an effect on other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in the form of a halo and is made of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "very problematic and worrying due to its high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the microbe in the hospital, and at least two of these were healthcare workers at the hospital.
In a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.

In France, voting is traditionally an experience with low technology: voters isolate themselves inside a booth and put the pre-printed paper ballot with their chosen candidate marked on it into an envelope.
Once the officers have verified the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.
The French electoral law codifies the procedure in a very precise way.
From 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes inside at the opening of the vote and that no envelope is added, except for those of voters counted and duly authorized.
Candidates may send representatives to attend every phase of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to very precise procedures.

Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in the government by MP Ed Davey. In Davey's place, at the Ministry for Work, MP Norman Lamb will go.
Huhne and Pryce were due to appear before the Westminster Magistrates' Court on 16 February.
The victims were Nicholas Alden (25 years old) and Zachary Cuddeback (21 years old). Cuddeback was in the driver's seat.
Edgar Veguilla injured an arm and his jaw, and Kristoffe Schneider needed reconstructive surgery on his face.
Uka's gun jammed when he was pointing it at another man's head. Schneider suffers from chronic pain, is blind in one eye, has a piece of his skull missing, and has a face reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via a remote video from a USAF base in his homeland.
Regarding Wednesday's event, Carpanedo also achieved two individual races in the Championships.
Her first race was the slalom, which she didn't finish in the first run. 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
In the other race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the group of sit-ski athletes with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place finisher, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four skiers from the group of seated skiers did not finish the race, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the giant slalom were not ranked.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and cell phone.
The Deputy Inspector General D K Arya announced: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her phone and laptop."
The defendants have been identified as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki has announced that the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were hurt.
The driver, however, was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while the emergency services were extracting the driver from his red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterwards, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya, since that time, finds herself in the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh, accused of having killed her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but the evidence of eyewitnesses could be tainted, given that her photograph has been published almost everywhere.
This practice is common throughout the rest of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish judicial system functions differently, and therefore, according to the court, the publication of photographs is potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that "it really seems that journalists want to cross a dangerous line by publishing photographs and other things of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for judicial proceedings, has declared to journalists that it will make no further comments at least until an indictment is made.
Following the flow of news, the document will concern the issue of borders that Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the Six-Day War of 1967.
It has been reported that other topics covered concern the future status of Jerusalem, sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requests a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years from when the agreement is signed, whereas Palestine approves a presence of only five years.
The shooters in the integrated pest species control experiment had to be strictly supervised by forest rangers, while the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In cooperation between the NPWS and the Australian Association of Sporting Shooters (NSW Inc), qualified volunteers were selected within the framework of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
Following Mick O'Flynn, the deputy director of conservation and heritage for NPWS parks, the four marksmen selected for the first hunting operation have been trained and have received comprehensive safety regulations training.
Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It's the fifth CEP of Martelly in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the CEP as a first step in a package of measures to bring the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the large protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, sometimes even violent, were caused by the lack of elections, some of which still have to be held since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunction due to overheating in iPods have been recorded, with a total of six that caught fire, causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has announced that it is aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Enterprise and Made in Italy announced that Apple had informed it of another 34 overheating incidents, which the company had defined as "not serious."
The Ministry responded by defining the delay in communication from Apple as "very deplorable."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 AM local time (Friday 9:19 PM GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said that no damage has been reported in the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took a group of tourists from Hong Kong hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been taken to safety and it has been confirmed that at least six people have lost their lives so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, had been released first, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly lady who needed the restroom. Mendoza was taken down.
He followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He studied to be an obstetrician and in 1959 he began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature births in his spare time.
Her research showed that the administration of a hormone accelerated the fetal maturation of the baby's lungs.
According to Xinhua, on Wednesday government investigators found two 'black boxes' with flight recorders.
Other wrestlers have also honored Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a night of two moons, something unique just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as strange as me... maybe even more so... I loved her very much and I will miss her... I hope she has gone to a better place than this."
Of the 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal elections, those who were against Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those interviewed share the same opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of those interviewed want Australia to become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent want Australia never to become a republic.
He would have had to swim the 100 meters and 200 meters freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games for the Olympic gold medal, but due to his ailments, his physical condition was in doubt.
He couldn't take the medicine he needed to avoid the pain because it's banned from the games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number in history.
More people verified the discovery using different hardware and software around the beginning of February, and the discovery was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the Earth, and also of organic matter that can form proteins, and therefore support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, given that comets have collided with Earth for a long time.
Cuomo (53 years old) became governor at the beginning of the year and last month he signed a law for the legalization of marriages between homosexuals.
He said that the claims were "political nonsense and stupidities".
It is said that he/she will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, will help airplanes fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses a technology based on satellites, as opposed to the older technology based on ground radar, to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport will be added, surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks or park and ride facilities are not available there.
The fear of lack of transport has led to the hypothesis that the match should be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian islands of the Galápagos.
According to researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden, the species developed in just two generations, even though it was believed that this process would take much longer, due to reproduction between a Darwin's finch (endemic species), Geospiza fortis, and the cactus finch (immigrant species), Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked to give it all kinds of shapes and it can also be rolled into small shapes.
You can draw it out, making it become a thread so thin that it can be twisted and braided. You can beat it or flatten it into sheets.
It can be made extremely thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that sometimes it was used to decorate hand-drawn designs in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called chemical pH. You can create an indicator through the juice of the purple cabbage.
The color of the litmus changes depending on whether the chemical substance is in an acidic or basic (alkaline) solution.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms are made of a proton and an electron).
You need to mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, you need to form a ball.
The moisture of your hands reacts with the outer layers, this will give a strange sensation and will form a kind of coating.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with a water flushing system connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes also found in public baths, which were open to both men and women.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space using a missile. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
To launch a satellite or a telescope into space, a giant rocket is needed, taller than 100 feet.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest advantage that the wheel has given us is that transportation has become much faster and easier.
We were brought by the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below these are also found mid-sized felines that eat mid-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are also many small felines (like domestic cats) that eat many smaller and much more numerous prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, that is, a special job that each cat has and that thus prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called prides.
In the branches, there are from one to three related adult lions and up to thirty lionesses and cubs.
Witches are usually closely related, as they are a large family of sisters and sons (or brothers and children).
Lion prides behave similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions in their behavior (but not to other big cats) and are deadly to prey.
A true athlete, the tiger can climb (even if not very well), swim, jump very far and pull with a force five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger is part of the same group (that is, the Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar isn't as full as the lion's but it's more like a growl, like when someone shouts.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and sometimes even birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (or prey) through their sense of smell, sniffing along the ground where the animals are.
They can see very well in the dark thanks to their nocturnal vision, and also move in a very stealthy way. Ocelots catch their prey by camouflaging themselves with the environment and then jumping on the prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) becomes separated from the main population of origin (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they go to a new island from where it is difficult to return), they will find themselves in a different environment from where they were before.
This new environment has diverse resources and different rivals, therefore the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to become a good competitor compared to what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, and still needs the same adjustments as before.
With time, little by little, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, they begin to resemble the other population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will have such a different appearance that they will no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (that is, send out with their breath).
Plants produce their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
Humans make houses and clothing using plants. Most of the food of humans is plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Her long jaw was a tempest of more than seventy well-sharpened teeth, together with another row of teeth in the roof of her mouth, so there was no escape for what or who stood before her.
It is not known for certain, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
He would also attack everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex couldn't have competed with him.
Even though most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual things to eat, such as wild boar, peacock, dormice and a type of rodent called a glir.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to socialize while lying on their side as they ate.
The meals of the ancient Romans could not include foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa and no ancient Roman ever looked for turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's house.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to take care of the gods' needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then a sanctuary inside where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes towers in the shape of a pyramid, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was the special sanctuary of the god.
In the harsh climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of Jewish families took place in the courtyard.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There weren't large forests in the land of Canaan, therefore wood was very expensive.
Greenland was colonized in a scattered way. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red had been exiled from Iceland for homicide, and when he traveled further West, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Even without his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Even though every nation was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was painted on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Anyway, it's not true. Even if something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears on the bottom of the document, underneath.
Even though no one knows for sure who wrote them, it is known that at the beginning of its life, the large parchment of the document (which measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was made to be put away.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation was added only to serve as a label.
The Normandy landings and the subsequent battles had liberated the North of France, but the South was not yet free.
It was governed by the French of "Vichy". These were the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were collaborating with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces had liberated Southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a sufficiently large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and to civitas, which means city or city-state, and which in some way also defines the dimension of a society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizing culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a cultural imprint that persists, and widespread dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving obvious historical traces and fail to be recognized as actual civilizations.
Following the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The congress lacked any power to impose taxes, and, since it was not an executive or national magistracy, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
He didn't even have the authority to override fiscal laws and tariffs between states.
The articles needed unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
The most popular sports include football (soccer), volleyball, basketball, swimming, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the chain/group of islands that Japan has, from a geographical point of view Japan is often called an "archipelago".
The history of Taiwan begins in the 10th century when European sailors passing by registered the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in native grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) seized control of the western part of Taiwan and its northern coasts, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration is still ongoing today.
For example, the most common image format for still photographs in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, the ratio has been inherited by the formats of digital image sensors.
The 35 mm format is a bit imprecise; in fact, it is 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio in whole numbers) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) are similar to this ratio or come very close to it.
The rule of thirds, often used and sometimes ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
It is established that the most effective position for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound together the states of Europe despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power influenced everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church are to be used specifically for this.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led to a lot of questions if this principle had been respected.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, the United Kingdom began a naval embargo of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this embargo violated generally accepted international law codified in many international agreements of the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom stirred international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sections of the ocean, causing danger also for neutral ships.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations desired to protect themselves from these situations in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor at work) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showcasing different periods of time; each phase of China or each family that was in power was a characteristic dynasty.
Furthermore, between each dynasty and the next there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those times, there were fierce wars between a series of nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit on the highest throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a number of social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, after the revolution, occupations were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and skilled to succeed.
The same applies to the military because military rankings, instead of being based on class like before, were now based on ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the oppressed working class of other nations to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that go beyond the life of this world. He frequented a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) to meditate.
The very chandelier, which has survived the time, gives a very vivid image of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
Perched on the edge of one of the mountains north of Gemona, the farmhouse is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not even easy to find it even if one knows that it exists. Once inside the hangar, there is complete isolation.
One sees nothing that isn't the beautiful clear sky above and all the mountains that surround it. One manages to see or sense very little of the world within this expanse.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that is still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramidal structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains many pyramids (and the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the other smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected to honor the women and members of Khufu's family.
The "arc sù" symbol looks like a V and the "arc jù" symbol looks like a parenthesis or a square without the bottom part.
Up means you have to start at the tip and push the bow, down means you have to start at the frog (which is where the hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
An up bow usually creates a softer sound, while a down bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to mark your signs with a pencil, but be aware that the symbols for passing the arch printed there are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
King Louis XVI, terrorized, Queen Marie Antoinette and their young children (Marie Thérèse of 11 years and Louis Charles of four years) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, on October 6, 1789 were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a throng of people who shouted and voiced threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to throw open the carriage windows.
At one point, one of the urchins smashed the head of one of the royal guards killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The costs of the United States' imperialist war in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were obliged to pay taxes to the American colonialist regime to sustain a large part of the expenses and the interest on the bonds that moved in the name of the government of the Philippines through the banking institutions of Wall Street.
Clearly, the large profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would have constituted the basic advantages of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era when these events unfolded is usually called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
The term "technological determinism" encompasses a range of ideas, from technological impetus or technological imperative to a strict sense that the destiny of humans is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path independent of cultural and political influences, and that technology, on its own, has inherent "effects" on societies, rather than being conditioned at a social level.
For example, one could say that the automobile forcefully leads to road development.
In any case, a national road network is not economically accessible for just a handful of cars, therefore new modes of production are being developed to reduce the costs for those who want to own a car.
Mass motorization also leads to more accidents on the roads, a fact that leads to the development of new medical techniques to treat damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures developed correlated with that geography, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrary imposed laws.
Just as Paris, which today is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of light began around 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
Its status declined throughout the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders had returned bringing gifts like silks and spices that were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was during that period that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the tenth-eleventh and the fourteenth centuries.
Initially, the clothing was very influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
Anyway, due to the slowness of communication channels, the styles in the West could remain behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of that time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is an agriculture carried out to produce food in sufficient quantity to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and often organic system that uses native seeds set aside from the ecological region combined with crop rotation or other fairly simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were employed in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar mentalities who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, position, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw upon the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, misfortune, or intentional abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their upbringing.
These children were called "ferocious" or wild. Some wild children were kept locked up (usually by their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child derived from the refusal of the parents to accept a child with a severe physical or intellectual disability.
Wild children may have experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others think that they were raised by animals; some say that he lived wild on his own.
When completely raised by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviors almost entirely similar (within physical limits) to those of the particular animal that raised them, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather a support that helps individuals who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so can the little paperclip man from Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is incorporated into the software and is designed to ask questions, prompt, and explain procedures that may be too difficult for the student to manage alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not caring, affectionate, and educational, but it happens.
We perceive the foster care system as a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving foster parents, a stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The foster care is designed to provide for all the needs that were lacking in the home where the children were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet have led to a further dimension in relation to the uses and gratifications theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" have been identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that one can perceive if a person is telling lies by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The speech of the president" pointed out that people who are unable to understand a speech due to brain damage, nevertheless are able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that these abilities in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domesticated dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variations: latent and manifest.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection draws it out from the entirety of manifest variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variety back and forth between the two sets with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet the demand for amino acids with the available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to do so leads to serious consequences: slowed growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest if they are not cooked.
Instead, eating animals (ants, termites, grubs), not only is it easy to digest, but it provides a large quantity of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" more or less in the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of waking up repeatedly during a normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily using a sufficiently soft light that brings you into consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm in your dream, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to sleep, forcing you to wake up to urinate.
The amount of peace a person has inside is inversely related to the amount of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force present. Every person has the potential to find total peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that prevents us from reaching the goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been broadened by the Mahayana path of love and a wealth of Indian yoga techniques.
In the beginning, Tibetan Buddhism is very easy. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that embraces everything.
With Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. Through the visualization of a variety of deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures led to disagreement between those nations.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War was beginning.
It would last for the subsequent 40 years and would be truly fought, by proxy armies, on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize on the Romanian bridgehead.
In any case, these plans had become obsolete almost overnight, when 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union had entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the work of navies was to ensure that their nation maintained the capacity to move people and goods, and at the same time, to interfere with the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help the United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the German navy, mainly using U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have managed to conquer the United Kingdom as it had done with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hide.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were often children or young people, similar to the more well-known sheep herders. These methods of grazing animals are still used today.
The horseshoes for carts were made in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the tracks for the carts consisted only of parallel wooden beams, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach higher speeds and carry larger loads than those on the slightly rougher roads of that time.
The sleepers were introduced quite early to hold the tracks in place. Little by little, however, it was understood that the tracks would be more efficient if they had iron strips on top.
This became a common practice, but iron wore down the wooden wheels of carts more.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first entirely iron railroad was introduced.
The first known means of transport is walking; humans began walking about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the australopithecus, did not walk upright habitually.
Bipedal specializations are found in the fossils of australopithecus dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join environmental movements, and we can also become activists to partially reduce future suffering.
This is exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if you don't just want a temporary solution, then you should find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological developments of humanity, and the problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
Following its adoption by the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten print signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to some isolated distance to the printing house of John Dunlap.
That night, around 150 to 200 copies were printed, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent, on July 6th, to George Washington who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of that document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
A lot of paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. They call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are a lot of things regarding birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two legs like a T-Rex.
In practice, all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, that is 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately visible. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are generic enough to prevent an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term pudiese is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is based on an ancient familiarity with lice, which are insects very well adapted to parasitize humans.
Whether they are bed bugs or dust mites, they are insects of the night, adapted to living in the night or in the host's dwelling.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has discovered that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple can decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise a child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their children.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to discover how the world works using scientific methods. These methods, in effect, guide most scientific research.
Experimentation isn't done alone, though, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses; also, asking questions and making observations guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinions were accepted on all scientific topics, including psychology.
With the decline of the knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from the Greek roots of philosophy and science.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour often crucially depends on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that maintain a free-running cycle period even without external signals.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the key suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, marking the DNA inside bacteriophages with radioactive phosphorus and the protein of the bacteriophages with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells were germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations in other parts can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning something about the story of orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave the small villages in the countryside by car to go to their workplace and they meet those who have the workplace destination in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport framework, everyone somehow supports and is connected to a transport system based on private automobiles.
Science now indicates that this large-scale carbon economy has detached the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution in the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed nations, similar levels of complaint regarding water quality or dropping points are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems generate these complaints, why do they fail every other day? Are transport engineers really incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of cars and individual vehicles between two points and the interaction they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, autistic people tend to behave within a fairly constant spectrum; thus, traffic flows tend to have a certain consistency and can be represented in a roughly mathematical way.
To better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and management of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider choice of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus asserted that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
Someone thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even those other stars).
That seems reasonable, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with points where it reaches six miles in width.
Approximately 20 percent of all the water that discharges from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River's main stream is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It gathers water from a thousand smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their dimensions and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were thousands of years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent nation in the world and the nation with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used by most of those who work in the state where Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as these can be found in nature in native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, even if he had also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Basically, alloys are mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
It is also possible to have alloys that include small quantities of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that billions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
It's a shame that, given that new writing methods have emerged, the pencil has been relegated to a minor position and use.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens, without ever having to get close to a pencil.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with a lot of protons and neutrons.
More or less like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy at that moment.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus and this means that they are prone to split with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made of craters and dust. The external layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the closer side and 100 km thick on the farther side.
It is thinner under the marshes and thicker under the plateaus.
There might be more landslides on the closest side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to come up towards the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what makes people tick or what pleases them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized while maturing towards adulthood.
These theories look at what certain people do in a way that they desire the things they want and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when superiors start leading their peers from the past. On one side of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the boys (or girls)."
This type of administrator has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, delegating responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, someone transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she has to change everything the group was doing and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is essentially responsible for the success or failure of the group.
This behavior often results in conflicts between the leader and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups are treated with the same level of excellence as conventional groups, but there are subtle differences.
The members of the virtual group often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of the conventional group, given that their group can meet according to various time zones that might not be understood by local management.
Also, the presence of a true "invisible group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is a unique component of a virtual group.
The "invisible group" is the management group to which each member reports. The invisible group establishes the criteria for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through a process that wastes time to create a learning organization? One purpose of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be unleashed.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process that serves the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains continuous methodologies as methods used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical methodology in the investigation of cognition. They therefore narrow the area of research and make it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and cancers affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate the structures and processes of the brain never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Even though AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI is a very important field of computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves creating machines for automated functions that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer requests, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is often used nowadays in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and in the military field, given that it has been incorporated into many home computers and software applications for video games.
Field trips are an important part of every classroom. Often a teacher would really like to take their students to places where travel by bus isn't possible.
Technology offers a solution with virtual tours. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual tour is also a way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; every year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online as a diary.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. Usually students begin their experience with blogs with poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience usually changes them.
Given that students are often the most critical audience, the blog's author is starting to make an effort to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
Furthermore, writing a blog "obliges students to become more expert in the world that surrounds them." The need to feed the public's interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning far beyond the traditional school day.
An appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by responding actively to internet materials, students can define their positions within the context of the writings of others as well as delineate their points of view on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the bilingual capital city of Canada and offers an assortment of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
The Niagara Falls are further south, and the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and others still highlight Ontario as what is considered quintessentially Canadian by foreigners.
Areas further north are rather sparsely populated, and some are wild and almost uninhabited.
To make a population comparison that surprises a lot of people: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and famous as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it took root very well in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
In the North, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the South and West by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that any female traveler say she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
He should also have a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they consider harassment and it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, and so on.
You must be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to maintain your position (cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by a Berber fisherman in the 10th century BC, and it was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese had destroyed it and rebuilt it with the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt it as Daru I-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who had established their trading bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco to shop.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes, and a lot of knick-knacks, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets, especially in the city center.
Even though Goma is quite safe, for all visits outside of Goma, investigations are needed to understand the conflict situation prevailing in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, near some of the most affordable itineraries for seeing mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a motorcycle taxi to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" ended up being used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today Timbuktu is an unimportant city, even if its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the longest breaks during the PBS special "Henry Louis Gates's African Wonders."
The city is in stark contrast with the rest of the cities in the nation, because it has a style that is more Arab than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the Northeast of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the East, Zimbabwe to the North, and to the South, the border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered a jewel in the crown of South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation and entry fees for the park.
It might be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which provides entry either to selected South African parks or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and is the place that many tourists consider the main center.
The parade of buildings that creates the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a bar graph shimmering, made evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go towards the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is heavily concentrated on land reclaimed along the northern coast.
This is the place that British colonizers appropriated, and therefore if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, stretching for 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the woods aren't just mangrove swamps: they include some of the last areas of trees from the immense jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which one third is covered by swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Given that interdistrict buses are often full, it is better to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a faster and more convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control posts should be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was the territory of other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was born, first called "The giant province of the Indies", as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquistadors with groups of native indigenous people.
The Spanish began the period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best teams and best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Here you can see small tournaments and matches even at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), its value is pegged as equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
The currency can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, which is in Stanley on the other side of the West Store of the FIC.
The British pound is generally accepted throughout the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
On the outermost islands credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if they may take British and American currencies; check with the owners beforehand to determine which payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange the currency before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is subtropical; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be insidiously cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the combination of air and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer reads.
There aren't particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains more or less the same throughout the year.
Even though many of the park's animals are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, wapiti, moose, bears and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year dozens of visitors get hurt because they haven't respected the adequate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Furthermore, be careful that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying around or cooking odorous foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s, in the 19th century, and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of a single English cruiser. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the killing of the sovereign chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a lot of beaches, thanks to the fact that Auckland is straddling two harbours. The most popular ones are in three zones.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the North to Devonport in the South.
They are almost all sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most of them have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are beaches for families, sometimes crowded, with a good variety of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is the 'Numar un' (Number One), it's not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to try, but the wines from New Zealand and those from Australia are closer.
The local tap water is very safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A short black is an 'espresso', a cappuccino arrives full of cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is at the Belgian level. The apple strudels are expensive but excellent.
A lot of trips to the coral reef are done throughout the year, and accidents due to these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Despite all that, listen to the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are often found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can also be found sporadically outside of this period.
Sharks really do exist, but it's rare for them to attack humans. Most sharks are scared of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of having a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include meals, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also block the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (for example, the visa).
Any modification or request, however, must first go through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For other festivals, most of those who participate in music festivals decide to camp on site, and most participants consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive very early to find a place where you can camp near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stage may be finished, there may be other sections of the festival that will continue playing music until late at night.
Some campsites have special areas for families with young children.
If you cross the Baltic Sea from the North in Winter, check the cabin's position, because crossing the ice can cause a rather horrible sound for those most affected.
Cruise ships in St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the need for a visa (check conditions).
Casinos usually make a great effort to maximize the time and money that guests spend. Clocks and windows are usually absent, and exits are difficult to find.
Usually they have special offers for food, drinks and entertainment, to keep the guests in a good mood, and keep them in the place.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages courtesy of the house. However, being drunk compromises judgment, and every good player knows the importance of staying sober.
All those who wish to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, the friction is low, and you can't drive like you do on dry asphalt.
A flurry of snow in a short time can drop enough snow to block you in.
Visibility may also be limited due to snowdrift or blowing snow, or condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
Moreover, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues almost without interruptions throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps what attracts the most tourists to Africa and the most important activity for many visitors.
The term safari, in popular usage, refers to a trip across the land to see the magnificent wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and conventional devices allow for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "excursion," or simply "walking") consists of excursions, lasting from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympics will be from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, given that it hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked the flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March most coronavirus cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Be aware that tickets for most events will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, and the normal ticket cost will be around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, even if they are not present in the room.
If a clothes iron isn't available, or if you don't like wearing damp socks, then you can use a hairdryer, if it's available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (as this could cause it to shrink, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling the water for a minute is enough, in others several minutes are needed.
The filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, it is better to consider buying water in sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals that are unfamiliar to them in their regions of origin.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation, or, in worse cases, trigger an allergic reaction, spread poison, or transmit infections.
The same infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force, are usually not classified as parasites.
Buying without duties is an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers heading directly to countries with high sales taxes can save a lot of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through isolated wooded areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp bends are common.
The indicated speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections, usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h), and respecting them rigorously here is even more important than in other circumstances.
Curiously, however, the cell phone service is stronger here than along many other stretches of road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German desserts are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, resembling those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Apple desserts are common, with applesauce used in sweets throughout the year, and cherries and berries that start to appear towards the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, walnuts, and other dried fruits. Often, the famous cakes go very well with a strong coffee.
If you want something small but filling sweet, try what, depending on the region, is called a Berliner, pfannkuchen or crofe.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and in some other regions of the coast of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a generic term that covers a great variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
However, if used without further qualification, the term tends to mean that the food originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Zave's cuisine, now easily available throughout the archipelago, presents a series of simply prepared dishes; the predominant flavors that the inhabitants of Zave prefer are berries, chili pepper, sugar (especially Zave's coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are the supports for the feet of riders that hang down along both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, but they can cause concerns for safety due to the possibility that a rider's foot can get caught in one of them.
If a rider falls off a horse, but has a foot caught in a stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize the risk, safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth and rather narrow sole.
Afterwards, some saddles, particularly English ones, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to come off the saddle if it is pulled back by a rider who is falling.
The Cochamó Valley: the premier climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and waterfalls.
The peaks offer breathtaking panoramic viewpoints. Climbers from all over the world are constantly charting new routes thanks to the infinite potential of its walls.
Winter downhill sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a board attached to the feet.
Skiing is the main excursion activity with a lot of enthusiasm, sometimes known as "ski fanatics," who plan the whole vacation around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old: the drawings in the caves that depict skiers are dated back to 5000 BC!
Skiing downhill as a sport goes back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 in Australia, Norwegians opened the first amateur ski club.
Ski mountaineering: this activity is also called ski alpinism, ski touring, or ski touring.
It is related, but it doesn't always include alpine or mountaineering skiing, the latter done on steep terrain requiring skis and boots that are more rigid.
Think of the ski course as a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover longer distances than with walking, but only very rarely will you achieve the speed of cross-country running without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a continent that is rather small, but with a lot of independent nations. In normal circumstances, traveling in a lot of different nations would mean having to apply for visas and having your passport checked a lot of times.
The Schengen area, however, functions in some ways like a nation in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross the borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a visa for each individual Schengen member nation separately, thus saving time, money, and documents.
There is no universal definition that says when industrial products are antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as objects over 100 years old.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit can be shorter in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques even if they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer husbandry is an important means of subsistence among the Sami, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many with other professions.
Even within the tradition, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived by fishing, hunting and so on, keeping the reindeer more as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern commerce. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the region of the Sámi.
Even though it is used a lot, particularly among non-Romani people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and the inaccurate perception of Romani people.
If the nation you are visiting becomes the subject of a travel warning, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the travel advisories of governments other than your own, but their advice is aimed at their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
These warnings are only a brief summary of the political situation in a nation.
The views presented are often superficial, generic, and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of bad weather, which can depend on geography, topology, and atmospheric conditions.
Hailstorms, storms, excessive rainfall and fires are forms and effects of bad weather, as are thunderstorms, hailstorms, waterspouts and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include snowstorms, blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be very attentive to any risk of bad weather in their area as it could affect their travel plans.
All those who plan to visit a nation that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A web search for 'Course for hostile environment' will likely provide the contact details of a local company.
A course alone will cover all the problems faced here with a lot more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course on average will last 2-5 days and will include role-playing games, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in wild places are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travelers planning gender affirmation surgery abroad must ensure they bring valid travel documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with undeclared gender (X) or with renewed documents to reflect the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is still very variable.
Even security checks at checkpoints have become much more intrusive in the era after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people before the operation should not expect to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the backwash from waves breaking on the beach, often against coral reefs or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the tornado's flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid current can form in deep waters.
Most deaths occur as a result of trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you come out of the current, swimming back to shore is no more difficult than usual.
Try to look where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your abilities or if you have been scented, you might want to wait for help.
The shock of the tornado comes before the cultural shock (it's not a honeymoon phase), it lasts longer and can be heavier.
Travelers who have had no trouble adapting to the new culture may find it very difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some customs of your native culture.
When one went abroad for the first time, it's likely that people had patience and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may also not imagine that it is necessary to have patience and understanding even with travelers who are returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in the twilight before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the noise of tourists and merchants. The story of sounds and lights is just like a book of fairy tales.
The Sphinx acts as a stage and tells a long story.
The signs are shown on the various pyramids that are being illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by various countries and are the islands with the most bases, with seven active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which hosts the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston and Deception, where the submerged caldera of a still-active volcano has become a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
There, the mountains of the peninsula merge with the high plateau and then rise again, forming the Ellsworth Mountains range, 360 kilometers long and cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern area, or also Sentinel Range, is home to the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif with Mount Vinson, 4892 meters high.
In the most remote areas, not covered by cellular networks, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, given that you have to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite in order to make calls.
The service is usually used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that need data and voice connections in remote locations.
The local telephone service provider should be able to give more information on how to connect to this service.
A increasingly popular option among those who want to take a gap year after school is to travel and study.
This solution is well-regarded by those who have finished high school and want to take a gap year before going to university without compromising their education.
Often, taking a year-long course abroad can genuinely improve your chances of getting into university once you return home.
Usually, one has to pay a university fee to enroll in these study programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and on lakes, a yacht isn't necessarily needed.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes may not be large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national pastime, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is similar to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it remains rather unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises make a stop for a good while in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
Therefore, you can visit the historical city for a couple of full days and return to sleep on the ship at night.
If you only disembark for cruise excursions, you don't need an extra visa (starting from 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin in their brochures, in Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never been on a plane before or have had a traumatic experience.
Nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different than personal fears or aversions to other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear that is based on the unknown and the lack of control.
Couriers are well paid for delivering goods quickly. Often time is very important when it comes to company documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
For some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and for smaller companies it was a problem.
If they shipped goods by plane, for certain routes ten days could pass before the goods were unloaded and cleared customs.
The only way to get it there faster was to ship the item as accompanied baggage. The airline's regulations did not allow baggage to travel without a passenger, which was therefore necessary.
The clearest way to fly first class or business is to pull out a nice wad of cash for this privilege (or, even better, have your company do it).
In any case, this choice won't come cheap: as a general estimate, you can expect to pay a business class ticket four times more than the normal economy fare, and for first class eleven times more!
Generally speaking, it doesn't even make sense to look for discounts on first class or business class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there's a certain group of travelers ready to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving at a place quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the founding of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and its own currency but is not recognized by any country of the United Nations.
Economic ties between the two parts of Moldova have been re-established despite the failure of political negotiations.
The most practiced religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very efficient transport hub.
Once there was the ancient city of Smyrna, now instead it is a modern and developed commercial center, which lies around a large bay and is surrounded by mountains.
Wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches, even though the city has an atmosphere closer to Mediterranean Europe than to Turkish tradition.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the island of Eysturoy, which is nearby, and has a church with an unusual octagonal shape.
Within the sacred ground, one finds interesting sculptures of doves in marble atop some of the tombs.
It's worth taking half an hour to stroll through this interesting village.
To the north and a short distance away is the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, famous abroad thanks to the fervent relation of its splendours written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb bus 403 often arrives in Sintra and also stops at Cabo da Roca.
Going further north, you can visit the grand Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place famous throughout the world for the apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
It should be remembered that you are visiting the site of a mass grave, as well as a place that has an incalculable significance for an important part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived those times here, and even more people who had their loved ones killed or put to work until they died, Jews and non-Jews in equal measure.
The place must be treated with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect that it deserves. One should never make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazism.
One should never ruin the place with carvings or graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half the people prefer to speak Catalan, most people understand it, and practically everyone is able to speak Spanish.
Anyway, most of the signs are written only in Catalan, because by law it is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also used a lot in public transport and other services.
Ordinary announcements in the subway are made only in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are communicated via an automated system in a range of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even if this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to feel comfortable in Paris is to behave in the best way possible, like a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) person. That way, getting around the city will be a lot easier.
The rough appearance of Parisians quickly disappears if you show them a little goodwill.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered in forests, mainly beech, spruce and fir, and features a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a great variety of plant communities, thanks to a series of microclimates, different terrains, and diverse levels of altitude.
The area also hosts a great variety of animal and bird species.
Here you can find rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the deer, the lynx, the wildcat and the black grouse, along with many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must have a skirt that covers the knee and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide a veil for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it has bright colours, the nun or brother at the entrance will sneer.
Along the same lines, men must also have breeches that cover their knees.
These too can be borrowed from the supplies at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after every use, so it might be unpleasant to put them on. The size for men is unique!
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of other similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any other available topping such as cheese, tuna, and so on.
All nouns, as well as the formal pronoun "Sie", begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish certain verbs from objects.
Perhaps this makes the reading easier, while the writing is a little more complicated, because you have to understand if a verb or an adjective is being used in a substantivized form.
Italian pronunciation is quite easy, given that most words are pronounced as they are written.
You have to pay attention especially to the letters C and G, because their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows.
It is also important to be careful to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: "caro" means "dear", while "carro" means "cart".
Persian has a rather simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar book will help you learn Persian grammar better and understand the sentences better.
It's logical that if you know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
In any case, people who know a bit of Spanish might too quickly conclude that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore it's not necessary to study it independently.
Today, pre-modern astronomical observatories are outdated and function as museums or educational sites.
Given that light pollution during their heyday wasn't the problem it is today, these are found in cities or on university campuses, therefore in more accessible places compared to those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous structures located in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Enjoying the blooming of cherry trees, called "hanami", has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where the chosen flower was that of the chrysanthemum.
In Japan, the first festivals for the cherry blossom were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy who frequented the imperial court.
Plants show themselves at their best in their natural environment, therefore one must resist the temptation to pick up even "a single" specimen.
When visiting the formal gardens, it is forbidden to pick up any specimens, under penalty of immediate expulsion without possibility of discussion.
Singapore is a city that is generally very safe, easy to get around, and where, once you arrive, you can buy almost anything.
But given that it is located in the "high tropics" a few degrees north of the equator, it has to endure the persistent drizzle and the sun's leaden weight (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also some buses that go north towards Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Better to check that the bus one wants to take goes all the way into Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba nearby.
Inland waterways can be a good idea for organizing a vacation.
For example, one could visit the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise along the Danube through interesting cities, or along the Erie Canal.
They also mark sections for popular walking or cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important solemnities of Christianity, when the birth of Jesus is celebrated.
Many of the traditions that accompany this holiday have been adopted even by non-believers, both in Christian countries and in non-Christian ones throughout the world.
Tradition dictates that one should spend Easter night awake somewhere outdoors to see the sunrise.
There are Christian theological explanations regarding this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian ritual dedicated to fertility and the Spring.
The more traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening of Easter weekend, with the congregations immediately beginning to celebrate Christ's resurrection at the stroke of midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands traveled here swimming, flying, or crawling.
Given the long distance from the continent, mammals were not able to face that journey, and giant land tortoises became the main grazing animals of the Galapagos.
Since man arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals such as goats, horses, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs have been introduced.
Visiting the Arctic or Antarctic in winter allows you to see the polar night, that is when the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This gives a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, because the sky will be dark more or less all day long.
Given that the population of these regions is not large and therefore light pollution is not a problem, one will be able to enjoy the stars.
The work culture in Japan is more hierarchical and formal compared to Western customs.
The "mude" is the standard work attire, and colleagues are addressed by their last name or by their job title.
Harmony in the workplace is fundamental, and what's important is teamwork more than individual results.
Often, workers have to get permission from their superiors before making a decision and have to obey the directives of their superiors without discussion.
