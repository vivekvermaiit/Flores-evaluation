This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had wings, a theory already widely known, but also details aspects commonly not preserved in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists have stated that this animal had feathers that were reddish-brown at the apex, with a slightly grayish or carotenoid-colored base.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in the bodies of birds.
The dinosaur's feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but they do have other characteristics - barbs and barbules - which is why researchers have concluded that the rachis may be a later evolutionary development compared to other features.
The structure of the fins indicates that they were not used in flight, but rather in temperature regulation and display. Researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen is not small and appears to be mature.
Researchers suggest that although it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not downy cheeks.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius Nebula.
The effect the team was looking for might be due to the tidal force interaction between the dark matter of the nebula and the dark matter of the galaxy.
Just as the moon's gravitational pull causes tides on Earth, so too does the Milky Way galaxy affect the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way it affects regular matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter surrounding a nebula exists as a kind of ring around it, and it is made up of many tiny particles.

Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said, "The new variant was extremely concerning and dangerous due to the high mortality rate."
Doubt is being cast that some patients and at least two healthcare workers in the hospital may have been infected by the insect.
In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people nearby.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, mark their preferred candidate on a pre-printed paper ballot, and place it in an envelope.
After verifying the voter's identity, the officials allow the voter to drop the envelope into the ballot box and sign the voting roll.
French electoral law rigorously codifies legal proceedings.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that only correctly counted and authorized voter envelopes are placed inside, with no other envelopes present.
Candidates may send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under comprehensive supervision, following a specific procedure.

In her other race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting group with a time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the winner, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth-place finisher, Zsófia Konkoly of Hungary.
Four skiers from the women's seated group failed to finish their race, and in the giant slalom, 45 out of a total of 117 skiers failed to place in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police have recovered stolen laptops and mobile phones.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, "We have arrested 5 people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile and laptop."
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaja Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
Despite that, the driver has suffered a serious head injury.
While emergency services were extracting the driver from the overturned Audi TT, the road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court, accused of his son's murder.
He is in custody awaiting charge sheet filing and trial, but any eyewitness testimony may not be entirely credible as his image has been widely circulated.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law operates differently and the court viewed the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University says that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is in charge of all legal proceedings, has informed journalists that no comment will be made until at least the indictment is filed.
According to leaked information, this document will address the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other issues reported include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel is claiming that if an agreement is signed, the current military presence in the valley will continue for ten years, while the PA is agreeing to keep this presence for only five years.
In the supplementary pesticide control trial, the shooters had to be closely monitored by the rangers, as the experiment was being observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Incorporated, eligible volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's talent identification program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Executive Director of the NPWS's Parks Conservation and Heritage Division, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation have received comprehensive safety and training guidelines.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in 4 years.
Last month, the Presidential Election Council recommended the resignation of the existing CEP (Chief Election Commissioner) as part of a package of measures aimed at steering the country towards fresh elections.
The extensive protests that began in October were the responsibility of Martelly's commission.
Violent protests, which occasionally erupted due to failures in organizing elections scheduled since 2011, took a fierce turn.
Approximately 60 incidents of overheating iPods leading to damage have been reported, resulting in 6 fires and minor burns to 4 people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the device.
Last week, M.E.T.I. circulated information about 34 extremely urgent incidents known by Apple, which were not "serious" for the company.
The ministry reacted to Apple's reported suspension of the report, calling it "highly condemnable."
The earthquake occurred in the Mariana Islands at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands emergency management office said it had been reported that no damage had occurred in the country.
Furthermore, the Tsunami Warning Center in the Pacific Ocean has said that there are no tsunami threats there.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer hijacked a Hong Kong bus and held the tourists on board hostage.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
So far, numerous hostages have been rescued, and the deaths of at least six people have been confirmed.
Six gunmen, including children and the elderly similar to those in the Philippines photographs, were quickly released.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot and killed.
Ligin followed in his father's footsteps and chose medicine as his profession.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the Ligins Hospital, he started researching premature babies in his spare time.
He learned from research that if a hormone is given, the fetus's lungs can develop properly during pregnancy.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
According to Tommy Dreamer, "Luna was the first winner of the Extreme Championship. She was my first manager. She passed away on a ग्रहण (Grahan) night. She was a powerful woman and unique."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels expressed his grief, saying, "Luna was completely crazy like me... maybe even more than me. I love her very much and will always miss her... I hope she is well wherever she is."
The number of voters opposing Australia being a republic since 2008 increased by 8 percent to 1400 in 2010.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Among the people who voted, 34 percent of voters commented that Queen Elizabeth should be Australia's last monarch.
At the end of this poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and 3 relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to difficulties, his fitness is in doubt.
He was unable to take medication to alleviate his pain because it was prohibited in sports.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
By the beginning of February, different people using different hardware and software had verified this discovery, and it was announced on Tuesday.
These plumes may be the source of Earth's water distribution, which helped create proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed after colliding with a comet a long time ago.
Cuomo is 53 years old and he began handling the state's governance from the beginning of this year, and last month he signed an agreement to legalize same-sex marriage.
He has termed this rumour as "political rhetoric and foolishness".
He is expected to contest for the post of President in 2016.
The FAA claims that the NextGen system will allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes, helping to save several million gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the old ground-radar-based technology to give pilots accurate information and to give air traffic controllers accurate information to identify aircraft.
No additional transport arrangements have been made, and overland trains will not stop at Wembley. Car parking at the ground and park-and-ride facilities are also not available.
The fear of lack of transportation increased the possibility of matches being held behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday mentioned the emergence of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have published a report stating that a new species has emerged in just two generations due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, *Geospiza fortis*, and the immigrant cactus finch, *Geospiza conirostris*, even though this process was believed to take longer.
Gold can be molded into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into small sizes.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can be twisted and braided. It can also be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and applied to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) the chemistry is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
A hydrogen ion is that proton from which an electron has been removed (because a hydrogen atom is made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, and then, with clean, damp hands, press and shape it into a ball.
The aqueous component on your hand will react with the outer layer, making you feel funny and forming a kind of coating.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet with a sophisticated drainage system.
Remnants of wastewater disposal systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, which were used by both men and women.
When you call someone a thousand miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and then it is immediately reflected.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and views that reach us.
A giant spacecraft taller than 100 feet is required to deploy a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is that it has provided us with easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
They have many medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized animals ranging from rabbits to deer and antelope.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats) that eat insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is having a niche subject, a specific task that each person holds, which keeps them away from competing with others.
The lion is the most social of the cat species, living in large groups called prides.
Prides are formed by thirty females and cubs, including adult males aged one to three.
Being a large family of sisters and daughters, the female animals in it are usually closely related to each other.
Lions, like hyena or dog packs, operate as a team; the animals are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats) and are also extremely deadly to their prey.
As a skilled warrior, a tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, leap great distances, and drag up to five times the strength of a strong person.
Tigers, like lions, cheetahs, and jaguars, belong to the same group (genus Panthera). These are the only four feline animals that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but rather a screaming sound, like indistinct words.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals. If possible, it catches monkeys, snakes, rats, shrews, and birds. Almost all the animals preyed upon by the ocelot are much smaller than itself.
According to scientists, Ocelots, being terrestrial, track and find their prey (food) by sniffing around and following the scent of animals.
It can see very well in the dark with "night vision" and also moves very quietly. The ocelot camouflages itself with its surroundings and then attacks its prey.
When a small group of animals (a small community) becomes separated from the main community they came from (such as when they pass through a mountain range or river, or if they go to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will require different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what was previously needed.
The indigenous population hasn't changed at all; they require the same utilization as before.
Over time, as new communities adapt to their new environments, they become less and less like other communities.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans inhale during respiration, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (i.e., release during respiration).
Plants prepare their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from trees and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Animals cannot survive without plants.
A Mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were filled with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and with an additional set of teeth on the roof of its mouth, meaning nothing that entered it could escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been cannibalistic as well.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a massive dinosaur like a T. Rex would be no match for it.
While we are familiar with much of the Romans' diet, they also ate strange or unusual foods such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of mouse called a dormouse.
Another difference was that poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs, but rich people preferred to have lavish feasts together where they reclined comfortably to one side while eating lunch.
Ancient Roman food could not include foods that came to Europe from the Americas or foods that came from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was regarded as the god's house.
People bring offerings to God, and priests try to fulfill God's needs through festivals and celebrations.
Each temple had an open courtyard, followed by an inner sanctum where only priests could enter.
Sometimes, distinctive pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
There was a special shrine for God at the top of the tower.
Housing was not so important in the warm climate of the Middle East.
Most of the lives of Hebrew families took place in the open air.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops along the road were just open counters. Stone was used to build the houses.
There is no large forest in Kanan's land, therefore wood is extremely expensive.
Greenland had very few inhabitants. The Norse sagas mention that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while sailing further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But even before his discovery, Eskimo tribes were living there at that time.
Even though every country was 'Scandinavian', there were still many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," then you might think there's a secret treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Still, that's not true. Even though there is something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The words written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The writing appears upside down, at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows exactly who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for preservation.
Therefore, that tag was probably only added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the southern part remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the French "Vichy" regime. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces attacked southern France, and this attack was named "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and advanced towards Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a significant large group who live and work together.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," meaning "citizen," which is related to the Latin words "civis," meaning "common citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city or town," and it also somehow defines the shape of society.
City-states are the precursors to nation-states. A civilizational culture signifies the transmission of knowledge across many generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and rightful expansion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as formal civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation - it consisted only of a Congress.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and, since there was no national executive or judiciary, it was dependent on the state authorities to enforce all laws, who frequently did not cooperate.
There is also no right to interfere with tax regulations and duties in the states.
Before the amendment, the articles required unanimous consent from all the states, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern region, so Italians participate in international sports and Olympic events.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island nation in the world!
Japan is referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective due to its cluster/group of islands.
Taiwan's history began in the early 15th century, where European sailors recorded the archipelago's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in the indigenous grain production system and employing Chinese laborers in rice and sugarcane cultivation.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing empire.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, who ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The complex grounds have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they would have originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size until the end of the analog film era.
It is still in production, but more importantly, digital camera image sensor formats have inherited its aspect ratio.
In reality, the 35mm format, somewhat confusingly, is 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, this format is said to have an aspect ratio of 3:2 (derived by dividing by a factor to obtain a simple whole number ratio).
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are identical or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds is a simple guideline, often misused and more often ridiculed, that helps create dynamism in an image by influencing its composition.
It describes that the most effective location for the main object is the point where the lines that divide the reflection vertically and horizontally into thirds intersect (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful and wealthy, came under scrutiny.
Despite differences in language and customs, Christianity has united the countries of Europe for over a thousand years.
This has affected everything - the power of expansion, influencing everyone from the subjects to the king.
A core Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and specifically, the church maintains monetary funds for that purpose.
In the Church, the central authorities have been based in Rome for thousands of years, and this centralization of power and wealth has raised many questions about whether it was actually following the rules.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
Although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, as evidenced by various international treaties of the past two centuries, the strategy of cutting off vital military and civilian supplies proved effective.
To block access to all parts of the ocean, Britain laid mines in international waters, creating danger even for neutral ships.
Since there was limited reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Around the 1920s, the attitude of most nations and citizens was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horror and devastation of war during World War I, many countries desired to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents he had, a poetry book, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison written by Charles Batchelor (his former manager).
In ancient China, there was a unique way to denote different time periods; each phase of China or each family in power was a specific dynasty.
Each dynasty also had an intermittent era of regionally divided provinces. The 60-year era of the Three Kingdoms between the Han and Jin dynasties is the best known.
Fierce battles raged between many nobles for the throne during these eras.
The Three Kingdoms period of ancient Chinese history was one of bloody eras in which thousands died fighting in wars for the supreme seat of the Grand Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences at play, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from democracy to totalitarianism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just the ruler.
After the revolution, the jobs were open to all male applicants, offering opportunities to the most ambitious and successful candidates.
The same was true for the military, because the army was now based on merit rather than rank.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working groups in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He would frequently retreat to a cave for contemplation, which became known as "Hira," located on the "Noor" (Light) mountain.
This cave itself, which has existed for a long time, provides a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
This cave, located at the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, even if one person knew it existed, finding it wouldn't be easy. Once inside the cave, it becomes completely isolated.
Apart from the clear, beautifully decorated sky above and the surrounding mountain ranges, nothing else is visible. From inside this cave, very little of the world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, it is one of the many large pyramids built to honor the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Necropolis, located in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (including the Great Pyramid, which is the largest), numerous smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the relatively smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up arrow" symbol looks like a V, and the "down arrow" symbol looks like a staple or a square without its bottom side.
Up bow means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down bow means you start from the frog (the part where you hold the bow) and push the bow.
An up-arrow typically creates a softer sound, while a down-arrow is more powerful and more assertive.
You can pencil in your own markings, but remember that the printed bow markings are there for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris, threatening the King and Queen who were surrounded by crowds.
The unruly crowd forced the King and Queen to keep their chariot windows fully open.
At one point, a rioting crowd member shook the head of a guard murdered in Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
In America's imperialist war, the Philippines' victory meant the cost of the war was borne by Filipino citizens.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover a major portion of the expenses and to pay interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Certainly, the excessive profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people will form the bedrock of the United States imperialism's core gains.
To understand the Templars, one must first understand the context that motivated the creation of the order.
The era in which these events transpired is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages of European history, specifically the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The Early Middle Ages were preceded by the Proto-Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around the year 1500.
Technical determinism is a term that encompasses various ideas in practice, ranging from technical-push or technical inevitability to a complex meaning where human destiny is linked to scientific laws with an inherent logic and their manifestation in technology governs it.
Most explanations of technological determinism suggest two common notions: that the development of technology follows a path largely independent of cultural or political influences, and that in this context, social conditions are "impacted" by society as a legacy, rather than the other way around.
For example, a person might say that the motor car necessarily leads the road towards development.
Whatever the case, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a handful of cars that can be counted on fingers, hence new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
A large number of car owners also cause more road accidents, which leads to the innovation of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged property.
Romanticism contained a strong element of cultural determinism, drawing from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In terms of imagination, geographical location molded individuals into a framework, and over time, customs and cultures related to that geographical location were created. Because these were consistent with the state of society, they were better than arbitrarily enforced laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
The twelfth-century saw its prestige decline, primarily because crusaders returned with more valuable gifts like silk and spices than were available in the Byzantine markets.
This was the time when the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the attire was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the former East.
Still, due to slow communication channels, Western styles may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
As the Middle Ages drew to a close, Western Europe developed its own style. The use of buttons for fastening clothing was a major success of that era, a result of such campaigns.
Subsistence agriculture is farming that produces just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to increase production with seeds saved from the local area of the ecosystem.
From a historical perspective, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this continues to be the case in many developing countries.
A subculture brings together people with similar perspectives who feel neglected by social norms and allows them to develop a sense of identity within themselves.
Subcultures can differ due to members' age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
A characteristic that defines a subculture differently can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and argot.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to highlight the unfortunate events that have befallen some children who, while growing up, have been neglected, suffered misfortune, or been intentionally subjected to abuse and kept away from social norms by adults.
Children like these are labeled "feral." Some feral children are kept in captivity by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, parents abandon a child due to a severe intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have experienced extreme child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
It is said that some are nurtured by animals; it is said that some live independently in the forest.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, a child's behavior (within physical limitations) becomes almost entirely like that of those particular caregivers, even to the point of fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning makes education easier and more engaging, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals undertaking a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold, and Microsoft Office's Clippy is also a type of scaffold.
Virtual scaffolds are implemented internally in the software and are intended to explain questions, prompts, and procedures that might be challenging for students to manage alone.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even exploitation.
No child should ever be allowed to grow up in an environment devoid of nurture, care, and education, but they do.
We feel that the foster care system is a safe space for children.
Our foster care system is expected to provide safe homes, nurturing caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is expected to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home they were previously taken from.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The use of the internet and satisfaction levels increase with additional measurements for its different features.
For example, "learning" and "social participation" are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
While researching audience responses on websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" as newly motivating factors.
Video recording has led to important discoveries in interpreting facial movements in micro-expressions, which last for only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that by accurately interpreting micro-expressions, one can know whether a person is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay cited in the President's speech, showed how people, due to brain damage that renders them unable to understand speech, will never be able to properly assess sincerity.
He also says that such an ability to understand human behavior may exist in animals like pet dogs.
Twentieth-century research has revealed that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Evolution adds new heritable variation, and selection removes it from the array of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination shift back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to meet its amino-acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, the consequences of failing to do so are serious: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
Protein in leaves and legumes would be the most readily available plant resource, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
On the other hand, animal feeds (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also provide high amounts of protein with all the essential amino acids.
Considering all aspects, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors had solved their "protein problem" to some extent, just like the chimpanzees in the savanna are doing today.
Sleep perturbation is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep time and going back to sleep after a short period (10–60 minutes).
It can be easily done by using a relatively gentler alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you tend to reset the alarm clock while you are asleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking excessive amounts of fluids (especially known diuretics like water or tea) before going to bed, which forces one to wake up to urinate.
The degree of thought in a person's body and soul is inversely related to the degree of inner peace in that person.
The lower the stress, the more readily available is favorable life energy. Every individual has the capacity to achieve complete peace and contentment.
Everyone can be illuminated by the light of knowledge. The only thing hindering us on this path is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian Yoga.
Tibetan intellectuals are generally very simple. It contains Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (spiritual energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The central deity of Tibetan meditation is yoga. Through visualization of various deities, energy pathways are cleared, chakras are activated, and divine consciousness is created.
In World War II, Germany was an enemy of both the USSR and the USA, which led to cooperation between the two countries. With the end of the war, differences arose between the countries due to customs, processes, and cultural disputes.
Two years after the war ended, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
This will last for the next 40 years and will be a fight for reality, with proxy soldiers fighting in battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and other places.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defense system had been shattered, and the only hope was to ally with Romania's Bridgehead and reorganize.
Nevertheless, these plans virtually collapsed overnight when the Soviet Union's Red Army, with over 800,000 soldiers, invaded eastern Poland, violating both bilateral and multilateral Riga Peace Treaties, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, subsequently establishing fronts in Belarus and Ukraine.
Using ships for transporting goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and materials across oceans.
The Navy's job is traditionally to ensure the ability to move your country, your people, and your materials, while at the same time hindering your enemy's ability to move their people and materials.
The North Atlantic campaign of WWII was one of its most notable recent examples, as Americans tried to move men and materiel across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At that same time, the German Navy, primarily using U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
Had the Allied powers failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain as well, perhaps even achieving victory over the rest of Europe.
It is estimated that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribal people started keeping animals to easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often with young children or teenagers overseeing the herd, much like well-known shepherds. Even now, these herding methods are still followed.
Wagonways were constructed in England at the beginning of the 16th century.
Although horse-drawn carriages have only parallel wooden planks, they still allow horses to run faster and carry heavier loads on better roads than on slightly bad roads.
Crusts were introduced long ago to hold the tracks in place properly. Gradually, though, it was realized that the tracks would be stronger if they had iron straps on them.
It became a common practice, but the iron rubbed more on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first all-iron rails were introduced in 1767.
Walking was the first known mode of transportation, with humans beginning to walk upright around two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Australopithecus and their ancestors did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal traits have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more in harmony with the environment, we can participate in environmental movements, and we can also become active agents to reduce the suffering of humanity in the future to some extent.
In many cases, this is only symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problems and neutralize them.
It is indeed sufficient to say that humanity has changed a lot due to scientific and technological progress, and the problems have also increased due to overpopulation and the extraordinary lifestyle of humanity.
On July 4th, after Congress adopted it, a handwritten draft was signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, and it was sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away for printing.
Around 150 to 200 copies were made during the whole night, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides."
This document was publicly read for the first time by John Nixon on July 8th in the yard of Independence Hall.
It was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The best-known surviving copy of the 25 extant Dunlop broadsides is the oldest extant copy of the document; the original handwritten copy does not survive.
Many paleontologists still believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and continues to live today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have scales on their feet and sharp claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
In reality, all computers used nowadays are based on a system of information that is coded in a two-digit number system.
In a binary number system, there is only one of two possible values, such as 0 or 1, and in computer terminology these numbers are called binary digits - or bits.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like nausea are often common and cannot be diagnosed quickly.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be an open medicine or a bottle of toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions intended for that particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This word comes from the ancient association with bedbugs, an insect excessively accustomed to infesting humans.
Both caterpillars and lice grow in their nests, adapting to their nests or the organisms they live on.
Across the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis are known to exist, and it is a cause of neurological disorders in young and middle-aged adults.
MS affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research suggests that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to save a baby.
These couples may choose a surrogacy plan for their child.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to explain how the world works through the scientific method. This method effectively guides a lot of scientific research.
Although it is not the only test, and a test is an examination used to reject one or more potential hypotheses, questioning, and commenting are also used to guide scientific investigation.
Naturalists and philosophers can delve into classical texts, especially the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all science-related subjects, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge and skills declined, the Western world distanced itself from Greek philosophical and scientific foundations.
Many people have observed correlations in physiology, and behavior often significantly depends on the presence of internal cycles and their production via biological clocks.
Circadian rhythms, which are not just a response to external periodic signals, but are encoded for many organisms, including bacteria, algae, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that maintain free-running cycles even in the absence of external cues.
A key premise of the Hershey-Chase experiment was that DNA is the genetic material.
Phages were used by Hershey and Chase to incorporate their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various types of effects depending on the nature of the change, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ-line cells.
Only changes in the germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while changes elsewhere are likely to cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the natural scenery, including plants and animal wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting Borneo, taking photos, and learning about the Orang Rimba.
Every morning, people leave the small town in their cars to go to work, and others are also like them whose workplaces are where they are now leaving.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this vast carbon economy has dislodged the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has supported human development for the last 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you probably hear the same level of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why does the transportation system provoke such complaints, and why does it fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental at play?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations, as well as their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic systems is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior falls within a reasonably stable range; likewise, traffic flows exhibit a degree of stability and can be represented mathematically to a reasonable approximation.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship is established between 3 key characteristics: (1) Flow, (2) Density, and (3) Speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first creatures to fly. The ability to fly helped them evade predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings.
Here they find more kinds of small places to hide from hunters.
In today's world, only dragonflies and damselflies are the kind of insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the solar system revolved around the sun.
According to some people's beliefs, he was correct, but a large number of individuals held the opposite view; that is, the solar system, including the sun (and other constellations), revolved around the earth.
That seems reasonable, since we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon is the world's second-longest and largest river, carrying more than 8 times the water volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river in the world, reaching up to six miles wide in many places.
The Amazon accounts for 20 percent of the total water discharged into the oceans by the world's rivers.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed to see the monuments of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
While Italian is the language most people working in the state use daily, Latin is mainly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as these can be discovered in their native form in nature and are relatively easy to excavate with ancient tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle's theory, everything is made up of a mixture of one or at most four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was like the 4 states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also asserted that it transforms into new substances that we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of 2 or more metals. Do not forget that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. However, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also find alloys that incorporate small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that millions of them can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, when the pencil came out, it became a good friend to many people.
Sadly, with the emergence of new writing methods, the status and use of pencils have diminished.
People are now typing messages on computer screens, and there is never a need for a sharpener.
One can only imagine what will happen to the keyboard if something new comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to bring together many protons and neutrons to form a nucleus.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Then, when the nucleus is split again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no force applied.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust's thickness is about 70 km on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
It is thin beneath the maria and thicker beneath the highlands.
Due to the crust being thinner near the surface, there might be more maria there. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
The subject matter's principles provide work to find the topic that either ticks or attracts people.
These factors suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that remain within them until they mature into adulthood.
These elements talk about specific people, what it is about some people that makes them want to do the things they do, and what in their environment will or will not cause them to do something.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Typically, two types of behavior can emerge when managers start promoting their old friends: one extreme of the spectrum is trying to maintain a "one of the boys" (or girls) attitude.
It is difficult for this type of manager to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary action, conduct performance evaluations, delegate responsibility, and hold people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, 1 becomes an unknown individual who thinks he will definitely change all the work being done by the group and make it his own.
After considering everything, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often creates disagreements between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual communities are often held to the same standard of excellence as traditional communities, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical community.
They often have more autonomy than members of a traditional team because their teams can meet across different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "Invisible Team" is a management team to which every member reports. The Invisible Team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing an educational institution? One goal of putting the concept of institutional learning into practice is innovation.
If all existing resources are effectively utilized across all functional departments of an organization, then creativity and ingenuity can be revealed.
As a result, the process of an organization working collaboratively to overcome a constraint can lead to the generation of a novel, innovative approach to meeting customer needs.
For any organization to be innovative, its leadership must first and foremost foster a culture that promotes innovation, the exchange of knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains continuous improvement methodologies as methods used to help organizations achieve high levels of performance.
Neurological biological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition, thereby narrowing and refining the field of research.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause alterations in certain mental functions.
With the advent of new technologies, we are able to see and explore brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building a simulation model, which helps us understand the process.
Although AI has a strong connection to science fiction, it still forms a crucial branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in machines.
AI research involves creating machines that can automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling, planning, and scheduling, the ability to diagnose customer needs and answer questions, and recognizing handwriting, voice, and faces.
Such things have evolved into distinct disciplines that focus on solving real-life problems.
AI methods are currently used in fields like economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being built into many home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher likes to take their students to a place as long as a bus journey is an option.
Technology provides a way with virtual field trips. Students can see artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or sit with their friends and appreciate beautiful art.
Informing others about a field trip is also a great way to reflect on any journey and an excellent way to share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state's capital, and that website is remodeled every year, but the old versions are kept online to function as a scrapbook.
Blogs also help students improve their writing. When students start their blogging experience with flawless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are always overly critical listeners, bloggers begin trying to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "forces students to gain knowledge about the world around them." The need to satisfy the audience's interest motivates students to be clever and proactive (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond traditional schooling.
Proper use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet content, students can outline their perspective on specific problems, including defining their position in the context of the writing of others" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and it is home to many art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
In the far south, there is Niagara Falls, and in the north, there is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and the region beyond.
All these things, and much more, identify Ontario, which is often considered by outsiders as the quintessential Canada.
The large areas in the north are very sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited deserts.
A surprising population comparison: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens in Canada.
The East African archipelagoes are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
There is talk about wildlife, Madagascar being the largest so far, and itself an island.
Most small island groups are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and it became widespread in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route connecting Europe to India.
Sahel is bordered by the northern region, and by the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
It appears that any female passenger can claim to be married without verifying her actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can also be helpful (not just one that looks overly expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in them judging oppression and that adhering to it is not uncommon, even when caught red-handed, etc.
Be bold in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to maintain your stance (cultural differences or anything else, it doesn't fix it!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BCE by Berber fishermen and was used as an important port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt this city as Dar al-Baida and it was named Casablanca by a Castilian merchant who established a trading base there.
Of all the places in Morocco, Casablanca is the least attractive for shopping.
It's easy to find traditional Moroccan goods around the old Medina, like tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and the full spectrum of knick-knacks being sold, but it's all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the far east bordering Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried much of the city's infrastructure, especially the town center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any reconnaissance involving visits outside Goma to understand the war situation in the North Kivu province should be investigated.
This city serves as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of Africa's most affordable mountain gorilla trekking.
You can explore Goma using boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis). A typical short trip will usually cost you around ~500 Congolese Francs.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for a foreign, different land.
Currently, Timbuktu is a dilapidated city, although its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the risk of desert sand.
It was a major stop on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, "Africa's Great Civilizations."
This city is completely different from other cities in the country because it has more of an Arabian character than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the Crocodile River along its southern border.
This park is situated on 19,500 square kilometers of land and is divided into 14 ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered a flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
Buying a Wild Card, which grants access to some or all of South Africa's national parks, can also be beneficial.
The Hong Kong region is named after Hong Kong Island, and this place is considered a major focal point of attraction for many tourists.
Hong Kong's skyscraper display is compared to a shimmering bar chart of the city's architectural profile, clearly reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon Waterfront.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is the place where British colonists established their settlements, and so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial history, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest coastline, extending approximately 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast across Bangladeshi and Indian territories.
Sundarbans has been declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The portion of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just tropical wetlands - they encompass the last remaining patches of powerful forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is covered by water/mud flats.
Sundarban has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is now estimated to have over 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most depart from Punakha and Jakar/Bumthang between 06:30 and 07:30.
As inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets in advance a few days prior.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana, on either side of the Oyapock River.
Both towers are 83 meters high, its length is 378 meters, and it has two walkways with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guarani are the most important indigenous group currently living in eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who farmed for their own needs.
In the Chaco region, indigenous groups such as the Guaycuru and Payagua lived, who made a living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "the Giant Province of the Indies," was formed as a result of the war between indigenous communities and Spanish invaders.
The period of colonization initiated by the Spanish lasted for three hundred years.
Following the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has succeeded in preserving many of its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is known for having the world's best polo team and players.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year is held at the Las Canitas polo grounds.
Small tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
Check the Argentine Polo Association for news about the tournament and where to buy tickets for the polo match.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Island Pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located near Stanley's FIC West Store.
British Pounds are generally accepted anywhere in the islands, and credit cards and US Dollars are also widely accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards from outside the islands may not be accepted, although British and US currencies may be accepted; check with owners in advance to determine what payment methods are acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, when it is summer there, it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Currently, Montevideo has a humid subtropical climate; in the summer months, temperatures above +30° Celsius are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer reading indicates.
There aren't distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons; the amount of rainfall remains relatively consistent throughout the year.
Even though many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards/meters away from other wildlife!
No matter how innocent they may seem, yaks, sloth bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, many visitors get injured because they don't maintain a safe distance. These wild animals are large, fierce, and potentially dangerous, so let them be.
In addition, remember that bears and other wild animals are attracted to scents, so do not carry or cook fragrant foods with you, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, this port was the infamous site of a naval blockade, when seven ships from Germany, America, and Britain were refused departure from the harbor.
Except for one British cruiser, all other ships sank. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
Paramount Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful gathering in the city, which was held amidst the struggle for independence orchestrated by the Mau movement.
Auckland is built on two harbors, so it has many beaches. The most popular spots are in these three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean, extending from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are mostly sandy beaches with safe swimming facilities, and many places are shaded by Pohutukawa trees.
Tāmaki Drive Beach is located on the Waitematā Harbour, near Mission Bay, and in the vicinity of St Heliers in Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes filled with families, with good shops of various kinds setting up from time to time. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number 1'; it's not a complex beer, but it is enjoyable and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
They have many French wines there to drink, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia might taste better.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easily available.
For Australians, the concept of 'pure white' coffee is foreign. A little black is 'espresso,' cappuccinos contain a generous amount of cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. The juice is expensive, but very good.
The reef is visited many times during the year, and the reef does not sustain any damage because of this.
Still, take advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found between October and April in the coastal waters north of the town of 1770 and near river mouths. They are also occasionally seen outside of this period.
Sharks still exist, however, they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not prefer to live in the open ocean; they mainly inhabit river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking assures travelers that they will not have any difficulty finding a place to sleep after arriving at their destination.
Travel agents often deal with specific hotels, however, it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping grounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also put your reservation on hold if you need time to think about the offer or gather other documents (such as a visa) for your destination.
Any amendments or requests should first be made through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, a large proportion of people attending the music festival decide to stay at the venue itself, and most consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to stay close to this activity, you'll need to go ahead to find a campsite near the music.
Don't forget that even after the music ends on the main stage, there might be sections of the festival where music continues late into the night.
Some festivals have special camps for families with young children.
If you are crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin situation, as going through the ice creates quite a frightening noise for those most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos typically make many efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
To keep the guests in good spirits and within the premises, special food, drinks, and entertainment are usually proposed for them.
In some places, alcohol is provided by the organizers. However, decisions are often flawed due to alcohol consumption, and all good gamblers understand the importance of remaining sober.
A person who is going to drive in high altitudes or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or extremely cold temperatures.
You cannot drive on roads covered in ice and snow as you would on clear asphalt, because there is less friction.
During a blizzard, so much snow falls in a short amount of time that it's enough to stop you in your tracks.
Visibility can be impaired by falling or blowing snow, or by fog or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, snow and snowfall are common in many countries, and traffic usually flows freely throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa's biggest tourist draw and a major highlight for many visitors.
The word "safari" in popular usage refers to an overland journey, especially in the savanna, to view the magnificent African wildlife.
Animals like elephants and giraffes tend to approach closely to observe cars and other well-maintained standard equipment.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy and don't come out into the open, and you'll see them even better through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walking," "hiking safari," or "foot safari") involves hiking for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will also be held in other locations throughout Japan.
In 1964, Tokyo would become the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics Games.
If you booked a flight or accommodation for 2020 before the stay-at-home order was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies varied, but most coronavirus-based cancellation policies were not extended past March, unlike the Olympics which was scheduled for July 2020.
Most tickets for this event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with the general admission ticket costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes helps to dry them. In many hotels, if there is no iron in the room, an iron and ironing board are available upon request.
If an iron is not available, or if you don't like wearing socks made of iron (which would be available), you can try using a hair dryer.
Be careful, don't let the garment overheat (which can become stiff or, in extreme cases, catch fire).
There are various methods to purify water, each being more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in other areas, it needs to be boiled for a few minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned about this, you should buy a sealed water bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animals and insects that they are not accustomed to in their own region.
Insects can spoil food, cause itching, or in a worse situation, trigger allergic reactions, poison, or infect.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill people, are not usually qualified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods in specific locations where taxes and customs duties are not applied.
Travelers can sometimes save a lot of money in countries with high taxes, especially on goods like alcohol and tobacco.
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, stretching between Point Marion and Fairmont, presents some of the most challenging driving conditions, frequently passing through isolated areas.
If you're not used to driving on village roads, be careful: there are many potholes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limit is significantly lower than in the preceding and subsequent sections – typically 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour) – and adhering to them strictly is otherwise more important.
While intriguing, this part of the route has stronger mobile phone service than other sections, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria, they are extremely rich and diverse in flavor, much like their southern neighbor Austria.
