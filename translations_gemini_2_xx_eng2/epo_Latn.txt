USA Gymnastics supports the U.S. Olympic Committee's letter and recognizes that the Olympic family definitely needs the development of a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the UOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, can be better served by moving forward with significant changes within our organization than by decertification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but also provides details that fossils cannot provide, such as color or three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown with pale or carotenoid-colored lower edges.
The discovery also gives insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but do have other features of feathers—branches and branchlets—the researchers concluded that the rachis is likely a later evolutionary achievement than those other features.
Based on the structure of the feathers, it is assumed that they were not used for flying, but more likely for thermoregulation or display. The researchers speculated that the specimen shows adult plumage and not juvenile down, although it is a tail from a young dinosaur.

They found that the Sun works according to the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system turned out to be driven by nothing other than their brightness and their rotation.
Luminosity and rotation are used in combination to determine the Rossby number of a star, which relates to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

The work done was mostly theoretical, however, a program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team was searching for the effect that tidal forces would cause between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon applies a pull to the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way apply a force to the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the manner of ordinary matter.
This theory says that dark matter around a galaxy surrounds the galaxy like a kind of halo and consists of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extremely Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview he said that the new variant is "very troublesome and alarming because it has a very high mortality rate".
Some patients may have been infected with the bacteria in the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two of them are healthcare workers from the hospital.
During one year, an infected person can infect from 10 to 15 people nearby.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the total group of tuberculosis sufferers appears to be small; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 infected at any given time in South Africa.

"Their temperature behavior is not as stable as in large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with those that are deep cavities in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team of the US Geological Survey and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a technologically simple experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put the pre-printed paper with the indication of their preferred candidate into an envelope.
After officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law codifies the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that there are no envelopes present before the start of voting and that no envelopes are added other than those of the duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each phase of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under close supervision, according to specific procedures.

Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to finish their races, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Assistant to the Chief Inspector D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver received serious head injuries.
The road where the crash happened was temporarily closed while the emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has remained in Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then, accused of the murder of her son.
She is being held awaiting formal charges and trial, but any testimony from witnesses may be influenced because her image has been widely publicized.
It is common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish law works differently, and courts view publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists do seem to be approaching a dangerous line if they publish photos or other details about suspects."
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for prosecution, explained to journalists that no further comment would be made at least until the indictment is made.
The document, according to the leak, will reference the border dispute that Palestine wants to have based on the borders before the Middle Eastern war of 1967.
Other relevant topics will reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of an agreement, while the PA agrees to allow the presence for only five years.
Shooters in the auxiliary pest control trial had to be carefully inspected by the foresters, while the trial was being studied and its effectiveness assessed.
In partnership with NPWS and the Australian Sport Shooters Association (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under a hunting program of the Sport Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, a substitute to the Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received detailed instructions on safety and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday to a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's first CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a set of measures to advance the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the unsuccessful organization of elections, some postponed from 2011.
Approximately 60 instances of overheating non-operational iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving minor burns on four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has reported that it is aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week MEKI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 new overheating incidents, which the company calls "minor".
The ministry reacted, calling Apple's delay of the report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake shook Mariano at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' Office of Emergency Management said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage, seizing their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Some hostages have been released, and so far at least six deaths have been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced an old woman who needed a bathroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth during his free time.
His research showed that administering the hormone accelerated fetal lung maturation in the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes', flight recorders, on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. Quite unique, like she herself was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as weird as me... maybe even more so... I love her and I will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the number of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard asserted during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the opinion poll share that viewpoint, desiring that Queen Elizabeth II be the last Australian monarch.
At the extremes of the opinion poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic medalist had to swim 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his ability was doubted.
He couldn't use the medications needed to survive his pain because they are forbidden in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery, using various devices and software, until the early days of February, and it was declared on Tuesday.
Comets may eventually be a source of water delivery for the Earth, and also of organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his term earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He mentioned the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
He will supposedly try to get elected as president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to FAA claims, will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to older terrestrial radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport is being run, and overland trains will not stop at Wembley, nor can parking spaces or park-and-ride facilities be found at the location.
Fear of a lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the game would be played compulsorily behind closed doors, without supporters of the team.
A study appearing in the journal Science on Thursday reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although the process likely took more time, due to mating between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be formed into a wide variety of shapes. It can be rolled flat into thin shapes.
It can be drawn to obtain a thin wire, which can be folded and braided. It can be hammered or rolled flat into a sheet.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal. It can be so thin that it was once used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
That's called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator by using red beet juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) a chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean, damp hands, compress them into a ball shape.
Moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will make you feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet in almost every house, connected to a complex sewage system.
Remains of plumbing have been found in the houses of Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the phone call and reflects it back down, almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and vision.
A giant rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing enabled by the wheel is the provision of much easier and faster transportation.
Because of it, we have trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are mid-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey on the scale of hares to antelopes and deer.
Well, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat much more numerous prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a specialization that each cat maintains, so they don't have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats; they live in groups called prides.
A harem consists of one to three related adult males and many, up to thirty, females and offspring.
The females are usually closely related to each other, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides function quite similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to prey.
A very well-rounded athlete, a tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull five times as strongly as a strong man.
Tigers are in the same group (Genus Panthera) with lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a phrase made of hoarse, exclaimed words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds whenever possible.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find edible animals (prey) by scent, smelling the traces on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in the environment and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originates (as if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one where they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will have to, in order to be a strong competitor, have different characteristics or adaptations compared to those they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
With the passage of time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they begin to look less and less similar to the other population.
Finally, with the passage of thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call that process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is a necessary consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen, which people breathe in, and they take away carbon dioxide, which people breathe out.
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is vegetables. Without vegetables, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in its palate, which meant that nothing that encountered it could escape.
It's not certain, but it's possible that it had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps it was even a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water, and even a giant dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus would be helpless against it.
Although we would recognize most of their food, the Romans did have their own set of strange or unusual feast items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their food sitting in chairs, rich men liked to have feasts together where they would recline on their sides, eating their dishes.
Among the dishes of Ancient Rome, there could not have been foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to take care of the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and also an inner sanctuary, which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The greatest part of the life of a Hebrew family took place in the fresh air.
Women were cooking in the courtyard; shops were simply open stalls facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on the way further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes already lived there at the time.
Although every country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was designed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in the early days of its existence the large parchment document (its dimension is 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So probably the note was added simply as a label.
The landings on D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south still remained unfree.
It was ruled by the French from "Vichy." These were French people who reconciled with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
After only two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
Civilization is a distinct culture jointly owned by a significantly large group of people, who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and that also somehow defines the dimension of society.
City-states are precursors to nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge through several generations, a lasting cultural trace, and sufficiently large dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government — with a congress as its sole component — under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any power to collect taxes and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it entrusted the implementation of its decisions to state agencies, which were often uncooperative.
It also had no right to override tax laws and customs duties between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before any change, and states related to the central government so casually that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, as well as the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among popular sports are football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 (motorsport).
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, so Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to the assembly/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often called, in a geographical sense, an "archipelago."
The history of Taiwan began long ago in the 15th century when European sailors fleetingly recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, transforming the indigenous methods of grain production and employing Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) occupied western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format in the world for photographing still images is 35 mm, which was the dominant film dimension at the close of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but, more importantly, its aspect ratio was inherited by the sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 34 mm high.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Several popular formats (APS format array, for example) are equal or very close to this proportion.
The much-insulted and often ridiculed rule of thirds is simply a guideline creating dynamism, maintaining a measure of order in a picture.
It states that the most effective placement of the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period in European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, became an object of critical investigation.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked European states despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its all-pervading power touched everyone from the king to the citizen.
One of the main Christian dogmas is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds exist specifically for that purpose.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the church has been in Rome, and this concentration of power and money has made many doubt whether this dogma is being obeyed.
Soon after the outbreak of fighting, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved its effectiveness, it cut off crucial military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Because such a tactic had a limited reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted military use of submarines.
During the 1910s, the dominant attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and brutalities of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid a return of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a position at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous workplace) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own way of indicating different time periods; each era in China or each family that ruled was a separate dynasty.
Also among all the dynasties was an unstable era of divided provinces. The best known of such periods was the Era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those periods, fierce fighting took place between many nobles struggling for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, positions were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same was true of the military, because instead of military ranks previously based on class, they were now based on personality.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this everyday life. He frequented a cave that became known as "Hira'" on Mount "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has been preserved through time, gives a clear idea of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Situated at the summit of one of the mountains north of Mekko, the cave is absolutely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easily found, even if one knows it exists. When one is in the cave, it is total isolation.
Nothing else is visible except the cloudless, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramidal structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and among the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples, many were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-bow" mark looks like a V and the "down-bow mark" like a bracket or a square without the bottom side.
Up means that you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means that you should start at the heel (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bow usually produces a more delicate sound, while a down-bow is stronger and firmer.
Feel free to add your own markings in pencil, but remember that the printed bowings are there for a musical reason, so usually they should be observed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were brought back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of market women.
They traveled to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a crowd, buzzing and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd made the king and queen throw open the windows of the carriage.
At one point a crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles before the terrified queen.
The Philippine people themselves paid for the military expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to offset a large portion of the expenses and the interest on the bonds circulating in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super-profits extracted from the vast exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that helped in the founding of the order.
The era in which the events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
Before the High Middle Ages was the Early Middle Ages, and it was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by agreement, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that practically covers a wide range of ideas, from technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the evolution of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influences, and that technology in turn has for societies "consequences" that are essentially its own, and not socially conditioned.
One could say, for example, that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being designed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the road, which leads to the invention of new healthcare techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, taken from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and with the passage of time, customs and a culture related to that geography emerged, and those [customs and culture] that were more harmonious with the society's location were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 BC.
In the twelfth century, its status declined mainly because the crusaders returned bringing silks and spices considered more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine bazaars.
It was at that time that the title of Fashion Capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style had its peak in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication, styles in the West could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the important achievements of the period was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out to produce enough food only for the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using saved seeds native to the ecoregion with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite people with similar viewpoints who feel overlooked by social norms, and allow them to foster a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Subculture members often signal their membership through recognizable and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, demeanor, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to mention the few unfortunate cases of children who, during their upbringing due to neglect, misfortune, or malicious mistreatment, were not socialized by adults.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, such abandonment of a child was due to the parents' rejection of a serious intellectual or physical disability of the child.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others were reportedly raised by animals; some were rumored to have lived in nature independently.
Raised only by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limitations) almost entirely similar to those of the specific caregiver animal, as well as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes a further step.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a tool that provides support to individuals within a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, both a teacher is a variant of scaffolding and the little paperclip in Microsoft Office.
A virtual scaffold is built into the software and should ask about, suggest, and explain procedures that might be difficult for the learner if he were to act independently.
Children find themselves in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not supportive, caring, and educational, but yet it happens.
We view the foster care system as a safety net for such children.
Our foster care system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Guardianship must provide everything necessary that they lacked in the home from which they were previously taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The special characteristics of the Internet give additional dimensions to the uses and gratifications theory.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivational aspects when they explored public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
It is specifically claimed that it is possible to tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks pointed out that people who cannot understand speech due to brain trauma can nevertheless accurately assess sincerity.
He even supposes that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and represented.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of visible variation.
Segregation and recombination remix the variation back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from available plants.
Additionally, failure to do so has serious consequences: reduced growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest accessible plant resources would be proteins obtainable from leaves and beans, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest if they are not cooked.
Moreover, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide high-quality proteins that contain the essential amino acids.
Considering all the circumstances, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way similar to how chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep procrastination is the process of intentionally staying awake during your usual sleep period and going to sleep after a short time (10–60 minutes).
You can easily do that by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to regain consciousness without fully waking up.
If you notice that you are resetting the clock while you are sleeping, it can be left on the other side of the room, which will make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Among other options based on biorhythms is drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep, which will make you get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person possesses is negatively correlated with the degree of tension in the body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive force there is in life. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle on the path to that goal is your own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded through the Mahayana path of love and through many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Visualizing various deities, one purifies the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates the illuminated consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, a clash of systems, processes, and cultures caused a separation of the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last the next 40 years and involve real battles, through proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, the only hope remaining was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international contracts, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transporting goods is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The job of a navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time hindering the ability of your enemy to move their people and goods.
Most notable among recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the allies were to fail, Germany could likely conquer Britain just as it had the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began breeding them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds roaming on hills and other pastures, often cared for by goatherds, who were often children or adolescents, similarly to the more widely known shepherd. These breeding methods are still used today.
Railways were being built in England from at least as early as the 16th century.
Although wagonways simply consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach greater speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of that time.
Sleepers appeared early enough to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it became clear that tracks would be more effective if they had an iron strip on top.
That became a popular practice, but iron caused faster wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The earliest known transportation was by foot; humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, australopithecines, did not walk upright as often.
Bipedal specialization is found in australopithecine fossils dating from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus likely walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start relating to the environment in a friendlier way, we can join the environmental protection movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
That's like symptomatic medication in many cases. However, if we want not just a temporary solution, then we must find the causes of the problems and we must deactivate them.
Of course, the world has been greatly changed by the scientific and technological achievements of humankind, and problems have become greater due to overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle of humankind.
After the Congress accepted it on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the congressional president John Hancock and the secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the printing house of John Dunlap, a few blocks away.
During the night, they made from 150 to 200 copies, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was performed by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent on July 6th to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives now. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs, like a tyrannosaurus.
Almost all computers currently in use are based on processing information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, using computer slang.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms like vomiting are general enough to prevent an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or a toxic household chemical.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term bug is used technically by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term derives from long-standing familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Bed bugs and bird bugs are both nidicolous, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child does not best serve their interests, or the interests of their child.
Such couples can choose to plan an adoption for their baby.
During an adoption procedure, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand, through the scientific method, how the world works. This method in fact guides the majority of scientific research.
However, it is not alone; experiment, and experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, questioning, and observation also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers concentrated their attention on texts, and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all topics of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West became clearly separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often critically depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and how the biological clock produces them.
Periodic rhythms that do not simply respond to external periodic stimuli have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that maintain a period of repeating autonomous functioning even without external stimuli.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the leading pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, labeling either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a spectrum of diverse effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the involved piece of genetic material, and whether the involved cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other locations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including flora and fauna wildlife.
Among the examples of on-site activities are hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit Borneo and there photograph and learn about orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small towns by car to go to their workplace, and are overtaken by others whose destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic commuting, everyone is somehow involved and contributing to a transportation system based on the use of private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere away from one of its stable states, which has been supporting human development for the last two million years.
Every person participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, one rarely hears a similar level of complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transportation systems provoke such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because one cannot predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a fairly uniform pattern; thus, traffic flows tend to have some moderate uniformity and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan, develop, and operate road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
That gives them a wider choice of small hiding places from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seemed sensible, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main river Amazon is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It collects water from several thousand smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, no one ever managed to surpass the pyramids of Giza in terms of size and technical skill of their construction.
The Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its laws and official relations.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements—like gold, silver, and copper—since antiquity, because these can be found in nature in their elemental form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
That was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he further theorized that they become new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
One can also have alloys, in whose composition are small quantities of nonmetal elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter consists of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good aid for many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, due to the emergence of new ways of writing, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and less use.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever needing to approach a pencil sharpener.
One can only ask oneself what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the nucleus therefore releases some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no stimulus.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
Perhaps there are more seas on the near side because the crust is less thick. It was easier for lava to spill onto the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what causes people to act or challenges them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized during maturation into adulthood.
These theories explore what it is about certain people, what makes them desire the things they do, and what things in their environment will cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can appear when managers begin to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the friends."
That type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, evaluating work performance, assigning tasks, and demanding accountability from people.
On the other side of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything that the team previously did, and appropriate it.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often, such behavior results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of high quality as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often function as the contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a traditional team, because their teams may meet across different time zones, which may be misunderstood by their local managers.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the administrative team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal for putting the concepts of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functioning departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process, when an organization works together to overcome an obstacle, can lead to a new innovative process to serve the needs of clients.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of effectiveness.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. It therefore narrows the research area and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior causes scientists to continue the research.
It is a long-known fact that various types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and change some mental functions.
The progress of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that were never seen before.
That provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models, which help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, which deals with learning and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Research in AI involves the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring, planning, and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Those things became separate disciplines that concentrate on providing solutions for real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and warfare; they are also incorporated into some home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are an important part of any teaching. Quite often a teacher would like to take their students to places unreachable by bus.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual excursions. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art, sitting in their classroom.
Sharing an excursion virtually is another great way to reflect on a trip and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina produce a website about their field trip to the state capital; a new version of the website appears every year, but the old versions remain accessible to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve writing in students. While students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "makes students become more understanding of the world around them." The need to nurture public interest inspires students to be wise and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages learners to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively reacting to online materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writing and also outline their own viewpoint on certain problems (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is a charming bilingual capital of Canada and it has a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
These and other things highlight Ontario as what outsiders consider quintessentially Canadian.
Vast areas further north are sparsely populated, some are almost uninhabited wildernesses.
This comparison of populations surprises many: there are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens in total.
The Islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is incomparably the largest and, with respect to its fauna, it is an independent continent.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent countries or linked to France, and known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, and it became deeply rooted in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and colonialism of Europe began in the 15th century, when the explorer Vasco da Gama of Portugal initiated the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can result in what would be considered harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, held by the arm, etc.
Be firm when you disagree with men's proposals and don't be afraid to not give in (whether cultural or not, difference is not necessarily tolerable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and it was used by Phoenicians, Romans, and Benimerins as a strategic port with the name Anfa.
Destroyed by the Portuguese, it was rebuilt by them with the name Casa Branca, but they nevertheless left after an earthquake in 1755.
The city was rebuilt by the Sultan of Morocco under the name Daru l-Badya, and the Spanish merchants, who established trading posts there, named it Casablanca.
Regarding shopping, Casablanca is among the least interesting places in Morocco.
Around the old city center, it is easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan goods, for example, tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of shiny trinkets, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east, next to Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, covering most of the city's street network with its magma, especially in the city center.
Goma offers sufficient security, but one must inquire about every visit outside of it to know the state of the battles still taking place in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, in addition to offering the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
In addition to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become popular as a metaphor for exotic and faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, but it is a tourist attraction due to its reputation, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was inscribed on the red list of world heritage sites due to the threatening sands from the desert.
It was one of the most important stops during the PBS special program Wonders of the African World, made by Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts greatly with the other cities of the country, because it has a style more Arabic than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in northeastern South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north to Zimbabwe, and south to the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each of which supports a different fauna.
It represents one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the most iconic among the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Just like all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation entrance fees for the park.
It is also useful to buy a Wild Card, which provides entry either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong territory its name and is the place that many tourists consider the most interesting.
The line of buildings that creates the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a shining histogram, made evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and cross over to the waterfront, which is located on the Kowloon coast.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on land reclaimed from the sea along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists appropriated for themselves, and therefore, if one is looking for proof of the territory's colonial past, this is a convenient place to start looking.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 miles) across the coast into Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forest is not just a mangrove swamp. Within it are some of the last refuges of the impressive jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 km², of which approximately one third is covered by water or swamps.
In 1966 the Sundarbans became a reserve, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in its territory.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) all day, but the majority depart between 6:30 and 7:30, especially those traveling west and to Jakar or Bumthang.
Because intercity buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are connected by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are fast and comfortable transportation for traveling to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters tall, it is 378 meters wide, and it has two corridors that are 3.50 m wide.
The clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction finished in August 2011, but it didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully operational again in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are scheduled to have been completed.
The Guaraní were the most notable indigenous group living in that place, which is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly under the name "The Huge Province of the Indies," came into being as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began an era of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is very well known for the fact that its polo teams and players are among the best in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields near Las Cañitas.
Here, one can also watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
Get information from the Argentine Polo Association about tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Island pound (FKP), whose value is pegged to that of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, but you can take British and American money; ask beforehand to find out which payment method is accepted.
As it is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, exchange the money before you leave.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, the temperature usually exceeds 30 °C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely reaches freezing, but wind and humidity combine, and therefore one feels colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the rainfall is almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals have become accustomed to the presence of humans, the animals are still wild, and one should not feed or disturb them.
Park authorities request that people stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful they may seem, bison, elk, deer, bears, and almost all large animals are capable of attacking.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept a sufficient distance. Because these animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, respect their space.
Furthermore, be aware that odors attract bears and other fauna, and therefore avoid bringing or cooking odorous foods and keep the campsite clean.
The city of Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The harbor was the site of the infamous naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Around 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the struggle for independence, which the Mau movement organized, a peaceful gathering at the city led to the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches thanks to its location between two harbors. The most popular are in three regions.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where one can safely swim, and most have shade from pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in Central Auckland.
They are sometimes crowded family beaches where shops line the shore abundantly. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is Number One. It's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called Manta.
There are many drinkable wines from France, but wines from New Zealand and Australia perhaps travel better.
It is completely safe to drink the local tap water, but bottled water is easily available if one has concerns.
To Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. Espresso is a "short black," cappuccino has abundant cream (not foam), and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate conforms to the standards of Belgium. Juices are expensive but excellent.
Throughout the year many excursions to the reef take place, and injuries due to any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signals, and carefully heed safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and estuaries from October to April, north of 1770. They may occasionally appear outside of this time.
Yes, sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea. Their main habitat is estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking early gives travelers peace of mind that they will have accommodation upon arriving at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, but you might be able to book other types of accommodations, such as campsites, through such agents.
Travel agents generally broker plans that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to get to and from the airport, or even combined plans with flights and hotels.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for the intended location (for example, a visa).
All changes or requests, however, must first be directed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, most attendees decide to camp on-site, and the majority consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get there early to grab a camping spot near the music.
Remember that music on the main stages may have stopped, but there might be parts of the festival where it will continue to play late into the night.
Some festivals provide special camping areas for families with small children.
If you navigate the northern Baltic in winter, pay attention to the location of the cabin, because traveling through ice causes quite a terrible noise in those most affected.
Cruise ships to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Passengers from cruise ships are visa-free (check the conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to ensure that guests spend the maximum amount of their time and money. There are usually no windows or clocks and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special foods, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and to keep them inside.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages for free, but intoxication impairs mental ability, and every good gambler is aware of how important it is to be sober.
Anyone who drives a vehicle in high latitudes or across mountain passes should be aware that there may be snow, ice, or frost.
On roads with ice or snow, friction is low and therefore one cannot drive as if on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, the amount of snow capable of blocking you in can fall very quickly.
Visibility can also be limited by either falling or blowing snow, condensation, or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather is normal in many countries, but traffic flows mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
A safari is perhaps the most attractive thing for tourists in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The word "safari" is popularly used to mean a land journey to see the amazing African fauna, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and ordinary tools provide a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes appear timid, therefore binoculars will help you see them better.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "walking safari," or "hike") consists of walking, whether for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be between August 24th and September 5th, 2021. Some events will be in other locations throughout Japan.
Having hosted the games in 1964, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked the flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you are likely in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were planned.
It is expected that tickets for most events will cost from 2500 to 130,000 yen, and that typical tickets will cost around 7000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have loaner irons and ironing boards, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if one does not want to wear ironed socks, one might try using a dryer, if it is available.
Be careful that the fabric doesn't get too hot (which can shrink it or, in extreme cases, cause scorching).
There are different methods of purifying water, but some are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is enough, in others several minutes are necessary.
Filters have different efficiencies, and if you care about that, then consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unknown in their home regions.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread poisons, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals capable of injuring or killing a person with force, are generally not counted as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the option to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, sometimes passing through isolated forested areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be extremely careful: there are many steep slopes, narrow corridors, and winding hairpin turns.
Posted speed limits are noticeably lower than those of preceding and following sections – often 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and they must be strictly obeyed, even more so than in other circumstances.
It's remarkable that cell phone service is still much stronger here than in many other sections of the road, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are very tasty, and in Bavaria they are very rich and diverse, similar to those of the neighbor to the south, Austria.
There are many fruit pastries that contain apples all year round, and cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes usually harmonize especially well with a cup of intense coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, taste those which are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish consisting of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually added to curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term covering a wide range of regional cuisines across the country.
Used without additional qualifying words, the term generally refers to the cuisine originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now easily available everywhere in the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a variety of spiced dishes, with the flavors preferred by Javanese people, that is peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various fragrant spices.
Hanging from either side of the saddle, stirrups serve as supports for the rider's feet.
They provide the rider with greater stability, but they can present safety problems, because the rider's feet could eventually get caught in them.
If, while riding, one falls off a horse with their foot caught in the stirrup, one could be dragged by the horse, which might run away. To minimize this risk, various safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that a falling rider can pull backwards to detach the stirrup leather from the saddle.
Cochamó Valley: the most important place for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with diverse granite walls and boulders.
The mountain peaks offer amazing panoramas. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes from the endless possibilities of the walls.
Downhill winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which one slides downhill on snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many fans, who are known as "ski bums" and who plan entire vacations based on skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing is considered a sport from at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians founded the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It relates to alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, but it doesn't usually imply them, as the latter takes place on steeper terrain and requires much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as if it were similar to a hiking route.
In good conditions you will be able to cover distances somewhat greater than when walking, but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small part of the world, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, to travel through several countries one needs to repeatedly complete visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area nevertheless functions in this regard as if it were a single country.
Provided that one stays within this area, one can generally cross borders without needing to go through passport control points.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa to each Schengen country, which saves you time, money, and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what goods are antiques. Some tax agencies consider goods that are more than 100 years old to be antiques.
Because the definition varies locally, in places like North America the age limit might be smaller than in Europe.
Handicrafts could be considered antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sami people, and the culture surrounding its trade is also important for many other artisans.
Even in tradition, not all Sami people, however, engaged in large-scale reindeer herding, but they lived from fishing, hunting, or something similar, using reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Currently, many Sami people work in modern jobs. Tourism offers important income to Sápmi, the Sami region.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially by non-Roma people, it is considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and erroneous ideas about Roma people.
If a travel warning is issued against the country you plan to visit, this may affect your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance.
It is also a good idea to consult the advice of foreign governments, even though it is directed at their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East could face situations different from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
A warning is just a short summary of a country's political situation.
The presented views are often superficial, general, and too simple compared to the more detailed information that one can find elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon capable of causing damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and consists of various types, which depend on the location, the terrain, and the atmospheric conditions.
Gales, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are presentations and effects of severe weather, in addition to thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Among the regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena are blizzards, snowstorms, winter storms, and sandstorms.
It is highly advisable that travelers pay attention to any risk of severe weather affecting their area, as this may affect any travel plans.
Every visitor to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for a course for hostile environments will most likely show the address of a local company.
The course will generally cover all the matters presented here in much more detail, normally with practical experience.
One course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines about survival in the wilderness, but there are few such works about war zones.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they carry valid documents for their return.
The willingness to issue passports without a specified gender (X) or updated documents consistent with a desired name varies from government to government.
Whether foreign governments are willing to accept such documents varies greatly as well.
Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the period after September 11, 2001.
Non-operated transgender people should not expect to go through scanners without their privacy and dignity remaining intact.
Surf is a retrogressive flow of waves broken on a beach, often at a reef or similar location.
Due to the diverse underwater formations, the backflow concentrates in a few deeper sections, where a rapid flow to the depths can occur.
The majority of deaths occur as a result of trying to swim upstream, which may be impossible.
As soon as one swims out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try aiming for a place where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills or whether you've been noticed, perhaps you'd prefer to wait until you're rescued.
Reverse culture shock occurs earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapted to the new culture sometimes have particular difficulty readjusting to their native culture.
Returning home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and lost some customs from your native culture.
When people traveled abroad for the first time, they probably had patience and understanding, because they were aware that travelers needed to adapt to the new country.
People may not foresee that patience and understanding are also needed with regard to travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the region.
You can see the pyramids in darkness and you can see them in silence before the start of the show.
Here you will generally hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The interplay of sound and light is just like a novel.
The sphinx is placed in the background and it is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and the various pyramids are illuminated.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, on which is the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island and Deception Island, whose flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a striking natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
United with the plateau here, the peninsula's mountain range later reappears, forming the Ellsworth Mountains, which are 360 kilometers long and bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or mountain range of the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak, Vinson, is 4892 m high.
In very remote locations without access to a mobile phone network, a satellite phone may be the only means.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, because you have to be outdoors with a clear view of a satellite to make a phone call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that have needs for remote data and voice communication.
Your local telephone service provider could give you more information about the connection to this service.
For those planning a sabbatical year, it is becoming increasingly popular to travel and study.
This is especially popular among those who finish secondary education, as it gives them a free year before going to university, without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, if you take a gap year course abroad, this can actually improve your chances of progressing to higher education when you have returned to your home country.
Normally, there will be a registration fee to join these educational programs.
Finland is a great travel destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and on the lakes, one doesn't necessarily need a yacht.
Despite the fact that the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats and even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland: one out of every seven or eight Finns owns a boat.
Such popularity is only seen in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand. But otherwise it's a quite unique statistic (e.g. in the Netherlands one in forty people owns a boat).
The majority of the various Baltic cruise ships also include a stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can fully use a few days to visit the historic city, returning to the ship at night to sleep there.
If one disembarks only via ship voyage excursions, a separate visa is not necessary (since 2009).
The brochures of some cruise ships include Berlin, in Germany. As can be seen above on the map, Berlin is not at all close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience regardless of age or background, especially if you have never flown or if you have had a traumatic experience.
That's not a shameful thing: it's no different from other personal fears and dislikes that many people feel.
For some people, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on not knowing or controlling things.
Courier companies receive good money for the fast delivery of items. Often time is very important for business documents, goods, or replacement parts for urgent repairs.
In some lines, the larger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem in other lines and smaller companies.
If they sent goods by cargo plane, on some routes it could take several days to complete unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to accomplish that faster was to send things as registered packages. According to airline regulations, one cannot send a package without an associated passenger, and that's where you seize the opportunity.
The most obvious way to fly first class or business class is to spend a very thick wad of cash for the privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, that is not cheap: according to a rough estimate, you can expect to pay up to four times the usual economy class fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
Generally, it's not worth the effort to look for discounts on business or first-class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of traveling quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the east of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but which is recognized by no member state of the UN.
Economic ties were resumed between these two parts of Moldova, although political negotiations failed.
The most important religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Having once been the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, and vibrant commercial center, situated on a huge gulf and surrounded by mountains.
Among the wide boulevards, the buildings with glass facades, and the modern shopping centers, traditional roofs of red tiles, 18th-century bazaars, and old mosques and churches appear sporadically, but the atmosphere of the city is more of Mediterranean Europe than of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
On some graves in the churchyard are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
It's worth dedicating half an hour to a walk through the intriguing village.
Located to the north and easily accessible, is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners when Lord Byron praised its magnificent qualities.
Scotturb bus line 403 regularly travels to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, visit the great Shrine of Our Lady of Fátima (sanctuary), which is the site of world-famous apparitions of Mary.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave and also a place of almost incalculable significance for a large part of the world's population.
There still remain many men and women who survived their time here, and there are even more people who had loved ones who were killed or worked to death there, whether Jews or not.
Please behave in this place with as much dignity, solemnity, and respect as it fully deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the site with marks or graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
But still, most posters are only in Catalan, because the law declared it the first official language.
In any case, Spanish is also widely used on public transport and in other services.
On the subway, regular announcements are only made in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced via an automated system in many languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Residents of Paris have gained a reputation for being self-centered, unfriendly, and proud people.
This is often just an inaccurate stereotype, but the best way to maintain smooth relations with Parisians is to behave as if one were "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make the trip much easier.
The abrupt manners of Parisians will quickly evaporate if one shows basic politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park has abundant forests, mainly of beeches, spruces, and firs, and it presents a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The diversity of vegetarian communities is remarkably high due to the range of microclimates, diverse terrains, and different altitudes.
The region is also home to an extremely diverse range of animal and bird species.
There one can find rare fauna, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wildcats, and capercaillies, in addition to many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear knee-length skirts and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries do provide linens for women who arrive unprepared, but the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you if you bring your own linen, especially if it is light-colored.
Similarly, men should wear knee-length trousers.
Those can also be borrowed from the storage room at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after every use, and therefore you might not feel comfortable if you use these skirts. There is only one size for all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like those of similar Mediterranean regions, has bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) as a base and uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in the summer, is "pa amb oli": bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available addition, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Every noun, in addition to the word Sie meaning you, always starts with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier, but writing becomes a bit more complicated because of the need to know whether a verb or adjective is used in the nounified form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most of the words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters most worthy of attention are c and g, because their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Moreover, one must definitely pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means chariot.
The grammar of the Persian language is relatively easy and regular in most cases.
Therefore, reading this grammatical introduction would help you learn a lot of Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
It goes without saying that if you speak a Romance language, it will make learning Portuguese easier.
But still, people who speak Spanish a little can quickly conclude that Portuguese is so close that it is not worth learning separately.
Generally, pre-modern observatories are outdated today and remain as museums or educational institutions.
Because light pollution wasn't such a problem then as it is today, they are generally located in cities or near universities, places more easily accessible than those where the ones built in modern times are.
The most modern telescopes for research are huge installations in remote locations under favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, also known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where the plum blossom was the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor only for himself and for other aristocrats around the imperial court.
Because plants look their best in their natural environment, don't give in to the temptation to remove specimens, not even "just one."
If you visit a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also cause your expulsion without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe and easily explorable place. Upon arrival, you can buy almost anything there.
But still, since you will be in the "high tropics," only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to contend with the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
Furthermore, there are a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the patriarchs from the Bible Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to use goes to Hebron and not just the adjacent Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme on which to base vacations.
Thus, it would be possible, for example, to visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, or to go on a cruise ship to interesting cities on the Danube, or by boat along the Erie Canal.
They also specify routes of known paths for hiking and cycling.
Christmas is among the most important holidays of Christianity. It celebrates the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers living in Christian countries or elsewhere in the world have adopted many of the traditions of this holiday.
Traditionally, people spend Easter night awake in an outdoor location to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could be about a pre-Christian rite of spring and fertility.
On Saturday night of Easter weekend, more traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil, and the congregations begin celebrating right at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that initially arrived at the archipelago came either swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance between the islands and the mainland, mammals could not make such a journey, and therefore the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since their arrival, humans have introduced many mammals to the Galápagos Islands, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, that is, the sun will not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good chance to see the aurora borealis, because the sky will be dark almost all the time.
You will also be able to enjoy the stars, because these regions are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is usually not a problem.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be used to.
Suits are the normal work attire and colleagues address each other by last names or job titles.
Workplace harmony is most important, as is emphasis on group effort instead of praise for individual achievements.
Workers usually have to get the approval of their superiors for all decisions made and they must obey instructions without question.
