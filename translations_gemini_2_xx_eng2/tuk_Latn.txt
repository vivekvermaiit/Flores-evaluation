Ring also reached a pre-trial settlement with its competitor, "ADT Corporation."
While one experimental vaccine appears capable of reducing the rate of death from Ebola, no drug has yet been clearly shown to be effective in treating an existing infection.
Initially, ZMapp, an antibody cocktail, showed great promise in this regard, but official trials revealed that it had a lower-than-expected benefit in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the US Olympic Committee's letter and recognizes that creating safe conditions for all of our athletes is an absolute necessity for the Olympic family.

It not only confirms the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement, that are not normally discernible from fossilized remains.
Scientists say that the upper part of this animal's feathers was chestnut-brown, and the lower part was pale yellow or carotenoid in color.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Researchers concluded that the rachis was a later evolutionary development compared to the other features because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed rachis, but did possess barbs and barbules, which are other characteristics of feathers.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were used not for flight, but rather to regulate temperature or for display. Researchers argued that the specimen shows an adult feather, not a chick's feather, despite it being regarded as a young dinosaur's tail.
Researchers argued that the specimen showed the feathers of an adult, not those of a chick, despite it appearing to be the tail of a young dinosaur.

They determined that the Sun operates according to the same basic principles as other stars: it was discovered that the activity of all stars in the system is driven not by anything else, but by their own luminosity and rotations.
A star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow, is determined by using both brightness and rotation together.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work done was primarily theoretical, but it was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The tidal forces existing between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way likely cause the effect the group is searching for.
Just as the Moon pulls on the Earth, causing tides, Akmayan's path also strongly influences the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have managed to conclude that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a flare halo around the galaxy and consists of a large number of particles.

Doctor Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming because of its very high mortality rate."
According to Dr. Molu, it is possible that some patients contracted this infection in the hospital, and at least two of them are the hospital's own medical staff.
An infected person can transmit the disease to 10-15 close contacts within a year.
However, the proportion of XDR-TB among the entire group of people with tuberculosis still appears low; in South Africa, it constitutes 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected with the disease at any given time.

"Their thermal property is often not as stable as, say, large caves on Earth that maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it's consistent with them being deep pits in the ground," said Glen Cushing, a member of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and an employee at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has typically been a low-tech affair: voters enter a booth alone and place a printed paper list showing their chosen candidates into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter deposits the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law codifies this procedure more strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that there are no ballots inside at the start of voting, and that no ballots are added except those correctly counted and placed by eligible voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe each stage of the process. The votes are counted in the evening by volunteers under strict supervision, in accordance with established procedures.

He first competed in the slalom and received a "did not finish" mark on his first run. In that competition, 36 out of 116 athletes achieved the same result.
In the women's sitting group in the giant slalom, another competition, she finished tenth with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who took first place, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth.
Four female skiers in the sitting group were unable to complete their runs, while 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to place in the competition.
Madhya Pradesh police department recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused were produced in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, and the emergency services extracted the driver from a red "Audi TT" car.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoeya is accused of murdering his son and has been held in Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then.
He is being held in custody awaiting arraignment, but any identification testimony from witnesses may be suspect because his picture has been widely published.
It is standard practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scots law operates differently and courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson from Dundee University, "perhaps journalists are treading a dangerous line by publishing photographs of suspects, and so on."
The Taj Directorate, which bears overall responsibility for the legal proceedings, told journalists that no further comment would be given until at least charges are filed.
According to reports, the document will refer to the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to restore to their pre-1967 Middle East War state.
According to reports, other topics mentioned include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan River Valley.
Israel demands that its military presence, which has been ongoing in the desert for a decade, continue after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to keep that presence for only five years.
Rangers were to closely monitor the shooters who were given an additional probationary period for combating pests, as the probationary period was monitored and its effectiveness was assessed.
The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) collaborated to recruit qualified volunteers in accordance with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flinn, acting Director of Park Protection and Heritage at the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation received extensive safety and training guidance.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in the nine members of the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as they transitioned into their new roles.
That is Martellini's fifth CEP council in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission advised the former CEP council to resign as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
That commission was Martelli's response to the widespread protests that began in October against the regime.
Sometimes, the failure to hold elections that were due since 2011 has led to protests involving violence.
It has been reported that there have been about 60 cases of overheating of defective iPods, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to those devices.
METI reported last week that they had informed Apple of 34 more overheating incidents, and that the company had told them they were "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of the "Apple" company's announcement "truly disappointing".
An earthquake occurred in the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT, Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management reported no damage within the territory.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no indications of a tsunami.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus of Hong Kong tourists and took them hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages were rescued, and so far, it has been confirmed that at least six hostages have died.
By that time, six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as Filipino photographers, had been released.
The photographers then took the place of the old woman who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot and killed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
She studied obstetrics and started working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to learn about preventing premature births.
His research showed that if hormones were administered, it would accelerate the maturation of the baby's alveolar lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators found the two flight recorder "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Luna also expressed condolences to her fellow wrestlers.
"Luna Extreme was the first queen. She was my first manager. She passed away during the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. She was a powerful woman," Tommy Drimer said.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was weird like me, maybe even more so... I loved her and I miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
The number of Australians opposing the country becoming a republic increased by 8 percentage points since 2008, among 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign ended.
34 percent of survey participants share the opinion that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
In the outermost reaches of the opinion poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but doubts are cast due to complaints about his physical fitness.
He couldn't take the medicine he needed to overcome his pain because it was banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
By the beginning of February, several people had confirmed this discovery with various devices and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Potentially, comets were a source of bringing water to Earth, along with organic substances that could form proteins and support life.
Because comets have collided with Earth at times, scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how Earth formed.
53-year-old Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political resonance and nonsense."
There is talk that he will run for president in 2016.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the "NextGen" system is a system that allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reducing carbon emissions.
Instead of old ground-based radar technology, it uses satellite-based technology, allowing air traffic controllers to guide aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional vehicles will operate at Wembley, surface trains will not be stopped, and parking and park-and-ride facilities will not be available above ground.
Concerns about a lack of transportation have increased the likelihood that the match will be held behind closed doors, without the attendance of team supporters.
A scientific study published in the journal "Science" on Thursday reported the emergence of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Although it is believed that this process takes longer, researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that a new species has emerged that evolved in just two generations due to the pairing of the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be molded into shapes of all kinds. It can be rounded, and it can be turned into tiny shapes.
It can be transformed into a thin wire that can be bent and braided. It can also be hammered or turned into sheets.
It can be made very thin and applied to the surface of another metal. It can be thinned so much that it has even been used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
It is called the pH indicator of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic a chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated based on the amount of hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Combine the two dry ingredients, then squeeze them with clean, damp hands to form a ball.
The moisture in your hands will interact with its outer layers, creating a pleasant and unique crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in buildings in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets also existed. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women went together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
It receives the signal from a satellite in space and instantly bounces it back, almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light and part of our vision.
To place a satellite or telescope in space, a huge rocket taller than 100 feet is required.
The wheel has transformed the world in unimaginable ways. Its greatest contribution to us has been making travel easier and faster.
He brought us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized game, from rabbits to antelopes and gazelles.
Finally, there are numerous cats (including domesticated tabby cats) that eat a multitude of small prey such as insects, rodents, hedgehogs, and birds.
Their success lies in the concept of "turf," a specialized job that prevents each cat from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Herds consisted of up to three related adult males, and up to thirty mothers and offspring.
Mothers often form large families consisting of sisters and daughters, being close relatives of each other.
Lion prides behave like packs of wolves or dogs, and the animals' nature is strikingly similar to that of lions (but not other big cats), making them exceptionally dangerous to their prey.
A muscular and powerful athlete, the tiger can climb (though not exceptionally), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
Tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars belong to the same genus (Panthera). These four cats are the only cats that can roar.
The leopard's roar, instead of sounding like a lion's roar because it fit in its throat, was more akin to a growling, squealing statement.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots find the animals they will prey on (hunt) by sniffing around the places they have been and tracking them by scent.
They see them very well in the dark with their night vision and move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with the environment and pouncing on them unexpectedly.
When a small group (small population) of living things becomes separated from its main population (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or move to a new island from which it is not easy to return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In that new environment, there are various resources and competitors, therefore the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than its predecessors.
The initial population didn't change fundamentally, yet they still require the same adaptations as before.
As time passes, and the new population adapts to its new environment, they begin to resemble the original population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We simply call this process that signifies the emergence of a new species "speciation." Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale with their breath).
Plants produce their own food from the Sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and sew clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, and therefore feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw was lined with over 70 sharp, awl-like teeth, and another set of teeth was located in its throat, meaning nothing that it caught could escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a chisel-shaped snout. It fed on turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it's even possible that it practiced cannibalism.
It attacked everything that entered the water; even a huge dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus Rex couldn't compete with it.
Although we are familiar with many of their foods, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent species called the dormouse, included in their banquets.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, wealthy men preferred to hold gatherings and eat their meals reclining on cushions, propped up on their elbows.
Ancient Roman dishes did not contain food products that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple, considered a house of god, for each of their gods.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard, followed by an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temple complexes.
A special sanctuary for God was situated at the top of the tower.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, housing has not been so important.
Most of the Iwrit family's life was spent outdoors.
The women were cooking food in the yard; the shops were in the form of open stalls facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
In the Kengan country, there were no large forests, so lumber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated by settlers. Scandinavian sagas relate that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter and, traveling further west, discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living here at that time.
Even if every country were "Scandinavian," there would still be many differences between the populations, kings, traditions, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've watched the movie "National Treasure," you might think a treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But, that's not true. Even if there's something written on the back of that document, it's not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated 4th July 1776" are inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence. That text appears upside down at the very bottom of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document was rolled up early in its life for storage (its dimensions were 29¾ inches by 24½ inches).
So, probably, that note was just added as a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by the French "Vichy" regime. They had made peace with the Germans in 1940, and instead of fighting the invaders, they cooperated with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in an attack called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a distinctive culture shared by a society, which is a sizable group of people living and working together.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis," which means "citizenship," and is related to the Latin words "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," thus defining to some extent the scope of society.
City-states are the founders of nations. Civilization implies the transmission of cultural knowledge across generations, the long-lasting legacy of culture, and its equitable spread.
Small cultures frequently disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states initially created a weak central government with a single component, Congress, in accordance with the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to tax and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, depended on state authorities, who were often unwilling to cooperate, to enforce all its acts.
He also had no authority to abolish tax laws and tariffs between states.
Unanimous agreement from all states was required to introduce amendments to the articles, but the states were so indifferent to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is one of the most successful teams in the world, they were champions at the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Famous sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians participate in international games and Olympic competitions.
With around 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu) under its control, Japan is the 7th largest island nation in the world!
Due to the island group/cluster that exists in Japan, Japan is often called an "archipelago" from a geographical point of view.
Taiwan's beginnings trace back to the 15th century when passing European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, began to change local grain production methods, and hired Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) occupied the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and, in 1885, declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) in 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, under which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which then governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three primary structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the periphery of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better understanding of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most widespread still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film in the late analog film era.
It is still being produced, but more importantly, its aspect ratio was inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Actually, somewhat surprisingly, the 35mm format is 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, this format's aspect ratio is said to be 3:2 (by dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number).
Many widely used formats (such as the APS format family) have that same aspect ratio or are very close to it.
The rule of thirds, often misused and frequently mocked, is a simple guideline for creating dynamism in an image while maintaining a sense of order.
It is said that the most effective spot for the main object is where the lines intersect when the image is divided into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had grown rich and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united the nations of Europe, despite their diversity of languages and traditions.
His profound power influenced everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the core Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that is precisely why the church has monetary resources.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the papacy was located in Rome, and such a concentration of power and money in one place led many to doubt that this principle was being observed.
Before long after hostilities began, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
Even though this blockade violated generally recognized international law, codified by several international agreements in the last two centuries, the strategy proved effective and cut off vital military and civilian supplies.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, even endangering neutral vessels.
Because this tactic provoked limited retaliation, Germany expected similar retaliation to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing views of the majority of citizens and countries.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, countries wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job offer from the "Edison" company in New York.
When he came to the US, he had 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of introduction written by Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of marking different eras; each stage of China's development or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
Every dynasty had its own unstable period divided into provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During that period, fierce wars took place among the nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying for the highest position in Sian's great palace.
The adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler are among the many social and political influences.
Also, after the Revolution, professions were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and capable individuals to advance.
Some go to military service because the class-based army ranks are now based on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammet was deeply interested in matters beyond the boundaries of this worldly life. He frequently visited a cave called "Hira" on the "Nur" (light) mountain to contemplate.
The cave itself, which has survived the test of time, provides a very vivid picture of the spiritual aspects to which Muhammad aspired.
Located in a mountain north of Mecca, that cave was completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, he doesn't easily reveal his presence even to someone who knows he's there. Once you enter the cave, there is complete isolation.
Nothing is visible except for the clear, beautiful sky above and the mountains surrounding us. Inside the cave, one can see or hear very little that pertains to the world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, consists of several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest of them), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and most of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The violin's "upper mordent" symbol is the letter V, while the "lower mordent" symbol looks like an arch or square with its lower side missing.
"Up" means that you have to push the bow starting from the tip, and "down" means that you have to pull the bow starting from the frog (the part of the bow that your hand holds).
The upper kemenche typically produces a softer sound, while the lower kemenche is more powerful and assertive.
Feel free to write your own notations in pencil, but remember that printed chord symbols have a harmonic reason for being, so they should usually be respected.
The disgraced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis Charles), and the King's sister Madame Elisabeth were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
They headed back towards Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob of people shouting and threatening against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At some point, a member of the mob brandished the head of a royal guard, murdered at Versailles, before the terrified queen.
The military expenses that American imperialism incurred to invade the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses, as well as to pay the interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the main income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of this order.
The era in which these events occurred is usually called the High Middle Ages, which is the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which traditionally ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is, in practice, a term encompassing many different ideas, starting from technological impetus and technological necessity, and extending to a strict understanding that human destiny is determined by a fundamental logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
The predominant interpretation of technological determinism shares two common ideas: namely, that technological development follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, exerts "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the car inevitably leads to the development of roads.
However, building a road network throughout the country for a small number of cars is not economically feasible, therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in road traffic accidents, which in turn necessitates the development of new healthcare techniques to treat the resulting injuries.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, traditions and culture emerged in connection with that geography, harmonizing with the place of society and proving superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of opulence began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
Primarily, its status declined in the twelfth century due to Crusaders returning from the markets of Byzantium with souvenirs like silk and spices, which were more valuable than the goods being offered there.
It was precisely at that time that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West could lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. As one of the biggest developments of that era, people began using buttons to fasten their clothes as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that is carried out only to produce enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system characteristic of the ecosphere, using harvested seeds in conjunction with crop rotation or other somewhat simpler methods of maximizing yields.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel ignored by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of several factors.
Members of a subculture often demonstrate their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behavior, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to showcase the situation of several unfortunate children who, during their formative years, were deprived of socialization due to neglect, abuse, or deliberately cruel treatment by adults.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been abandoned by humans (often their own parents); in some cases, the child's abandonment was due to the parents' rejection of the child's serious intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced serious child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
It is argued that others were raised by animals; some are said to have lived independently in the wild.
When a feral child is raised entirely by animals, they exhibit behaviors almost entirely similar to those of the animal that cared for them (within the limits of physical constraints), such as fearing or ignoring humans.
While project-based learning makes it easier and more interesting, flipped learning goes a step further.
Rather than a method of acclimation, it is assistance that supports individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as utilizing a new computer program or launching a new project.
Desks can be virtual as well as real, in other words, a teacher is a type of desk, and Microsoft Office is like a little paperclip person.
Virtual assistants are embedded in the software and are intended to allow the student to ask questions about, be guided through, and receive explanations about procedures that they may have difficulty completing on their own.
Children are placed in protective care for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even threats and extortion.
No child should grow up in conditions that are not nurturing, caring, and educational, yet they do.
We recognize the foster care system as a safe place for those children.
Our protective care system should provide safe homes, affectionate educators, stable education, and reliable medical care.
The protective care should provide all the necessities they lacked in the home from which they were previously taken.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique nature of the Internet leads to additional dimensions in terms of usage and enjoyment approaches.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are put forward as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998), who examined audience reactions to websites, also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new aspects of motivation.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only milliseconds.
It is argued, in particular, that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks demonstrated that people with brain damage who cannot understand spoken words can nevertheless accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in explaining a person's behavior may exist in animals such as domestic dogs.
A study conducted in the twentieth century revealed that there were two pools of genetic diversity: cryptic and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of apparent variation.
Segregation and recombination pass variation back and forth between two pools in each generation.
It is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its amino acid requirements from readily available plant sources in the savanna.
Moreover, there are serious consequences for not doing this: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant sources are the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
On the contrary, animal products (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide a large amount of protein containing all the necessary amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" more like chimpanzees do in the savanna today.
Segmented sleep is the process of intentionally waking up during your usual sleep time and going back to sleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
It can be achieved gently by using a somewhat quieter alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm in the middle of the night, you can put it on the other side of the room and force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based variations involve drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, which are known diuretics) before bed, forcing the person to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of the path that leads to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they were expanded through the Mahayana path of compassion and numerous Indian yoga techniques.
Essentially, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is Divine Yoga. Through visualizing various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and a luminous mind is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. The clash of systems, processes, and cultures after the war's end led to the estrangement of the countries.
After the war ended and two years passed, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years and was actually fought in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places, among proxy forces.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been breached, and the only hope was to retreat to the Romanian bridgehead and reorganize.
However, those plans were dashed overnight when the Soviet Union's Red Army, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, invaded Poland's eastern regions with over 800,000 soldiers, creating the Belorussian and Ukrainian Fronts.
Using ships to transport goods is, without a doubt, the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The function of naval fleets is to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its own people and goods without dispute, as well as to prevent your enemy from moving their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. Americans were trying to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, mainly using submarines, was trying to stop this activity.
If the Allies had not succeeded in doing this, Germany could have conquered Britain, just as it conquered the rest of Europe.
It is believed that goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to keep them as an easy source of milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed in the mountains or other pastures, and these herds were often looked after by goat herders, who were children or teenagers, resembling the widely known shepherds. These methods of animal husbandry are still used today.
Towpaths were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the sledge roads consisted of nothing more than parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads compared to the somewhat rough roads of that time.
Transverse wooden beams were introduced into use very early to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually realized that they would be more effective if iron strips were placed on top of the rails.
It became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete iron rails were put into use.
The earliest known form of transportation was walking, with humans beginning to walk upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestor, "Australopithecus," did not walk fully upright.
Specializations for bipedalism are found in "Australopithecus" fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, but it is possible that "Sahelanthropus" walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more ecologically clean environment, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to somewhat alleviate future suffering.
In many cases, it's like symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is clear that the world has changed greatly due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and that problems are further exacerbated by overpopulation and humanity's wasteful lifestyle.
After being approved by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few buildings away.
Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies of what are now called "Dunlap lists" were made.
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8 in the yard of Independence Hall.
One was addressed to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
These are the oldest surviving copies of 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist. The handwritten original has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But still, birds have many things that resemble dinosaurs.
They have webbed and clawed feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Almost all computers in use today rely on the manipulation of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, that is 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits for using computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not manifest immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are too general to establish an immediate diagnosis.
The most obvious sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine cabinet or poisonous household products.
Check the label on that specific poison for first aid instructions.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in an official sense for this group of insects.
The term originates from recognizing bedbugs since ancient times, which are insects highly adapted to living on humans.
Blood-sucking mites and ticks are nidicolous organisms, meaning they are adapted to live in a nest or on a host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
A husband and wife can decide whether raising a child is in their own best interests or in the child's best interests.
Those parents can choose a childhood savings plan for their baby.
In surrogacy, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method essentially guides the majority of scientific research.
However, it's not just that, there's also experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more hypotheses by asking experimental questions and making observations, which also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all issues of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language declines, the West becomes increasingly disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Numerous rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often significantly dependent on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production through a biological clock.
However, periodic rhythms that are not responsive to external periodic signals have been documented in many living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to cycle freely even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading hypotheses that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, labeling either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material segment, and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not, mutations can have many different effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, but mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or tumors.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including observing plants and animals.
On-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning information about that ecosystem.
For example, visiting Borneo to see, photograph, and learn about orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small towns by car to go to work, while others, whose workplaces are where those people just left, pass them by.
In this dynamic traffic environment, everyone is more or less interconnected, supporting a transportation system based on private cars.
Now science shows that this enormous carbon economy has eliminated one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transportation systems lead to such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers so incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points, as well as how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because a driver's behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave in a reasonably stable manner; consequently, traffic flows possess a certain reasonable stability, allowing them to be mathematically approximated.
To better represent traffic flow, the relationships between three key characteristics were defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Those relationships help in planning, designing, and operating transportation infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly. The ability to fly helped them escape from enemies more easily, as well as find food and mates more efficiently.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings lengthwise against their bodies.
This gives them lots of small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people considered it obvious, but many people believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolved around the Earth.
That seems reasonable, since the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
Also, the Amazon is the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles in width.
20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although building pyramids of stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, none ever surpassed the Giza pyramids in terms of size and technical perfection of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were already over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated country.
Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is the everyday language of the majority of people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because all of these can be found naturally in nature, and it is somewhat easy to mine them with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was composed of one or a mixture of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
He theorized that it closely resembled the four states of matter (in that same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but also that these could transform into new substances, forming what we observe.
Alloys are mainly a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys can also exist that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pen became a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of newer writing methods, the pen has declined to a lower status and usage.
Now people type news on computer screens instead of going near the typewriter.
When something brand new comes out, we can only guess what will happen to the keyboard.
An atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is required to concentrate a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons in one place.
It's like rolling a heavy cart uphill. Then, splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they are prone to decay with a slight push or no push at all.
The Moon's surface is made up of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
Its crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
Due to the crust being thinner, there might be more lunar maria on the near side. Lava was able to surface more easily.
Content theories focus on identifying what motivates or attracts people.
Those theories propose that people have certain needs and/or desires that they acquire as they grow older.
Those theories look at the things that cause certain people to want to do the things they do, as well as the things around those people that compel them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading former colleagues. One end of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the guys (or girls)."
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, administer disciplinary punishments, evaluate productivity, assign responsibility, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable figure who thinks they have to change everything a group of people does and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure, regardless.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are some slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their nearby physical team.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members because their groups can meet across different time zones in ways that their local leaders might not understand.
Furthermore, the existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is a unique component of a virtual team.
The "Invisible Team" is the leadership team to which each member reports. The "Invisible Team" sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through a lengthy process to create a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and innovation can emerge when all available resources are used effectively in all functional departments of the organization.
Ultimately, an organization's process of working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process for serving the customer's needs.
For an organization to be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuity Approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher productivity.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to examining cognition. Therefore, it narrows and refines the direction of research.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a very long time that various types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior, and also cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that were previously unseen.
He provides us with a wealth of data and materials to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Even though artificial intelligence has a strong scent of science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Artificial intelligence research involves creating machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include the ability to monitor, plan and schedule, respond to customer identifications and queries, as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have turned into distinct fields of science that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as they are now embedded in several software programs for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a large part of any lesson. The teacher very often likes to take his students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a virtual field trip solution. Students can explore museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or enjoy fine art from the comfort of their classroom.
Also, sharing a field trip virtually is a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina create a website each year about their trips to the state's capital, and that website is redesigned annually, but older versions are also kept online as a kind of memory album.
Blogs can also help develop a student's writing. Although students often start their blogs with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes this.
Because students are often the most critical listeners, a blog writer strives to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Moreover, blogging "forces students to gain a better understanding of the world around them." The need to maintain audience interest encourages students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and motivates students to extend their learning beyond the typical school day.
Using blogs appropriately can "enable students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet materials, students can define their own position in the context of others' writings and express their own views on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa, the enchanting bilingual capital of Canada, is home to a wealth of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Located to the south is Niagara Falls, while to the north lies Muskoka and beyond, a haven of untouched natural beauty.
All of this and more is turning Ontario into a place that outsiders consider quintessentially Canadian.
Vast regions located in the far north are sparsely populated, with some areas being almost entirely uninhabited wilderness.
Regarding a population comparison that surprises many: The African American population in the United States is larger than the entire population of Canada.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is, without a doubt, the largest and, when it comes to wild nature, a continent of its own.
Most of the small islands are independent countries or affiliated with France and are known as luxury coastal resorts.
The Arabs also brought the religion of Islam to these lands, and it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
With the discovery of the Cape route from Europe to India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama in the 15th century, European influence and colonialism began.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: Regardless of their actual marital status, it is recommended that any female tourist say she is married.
Wearing a ring is also beneficial (but it shouldn't look too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to things they consider harassment, and being followed, having their hand held is not unusual, and so on.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't excuse it!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but they abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Darul-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for shopping.
Around the Old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods like clay plates, ceramics, leather products, water pipes, and a variety of decorative items, but they are all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets, especially the city center.
While the city of Goma is sufficiently safe, to travel outside of Goma, it is necessary to check and understand the state of the ongoing military conflict in the North Kivu province.
Besides serving as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, this city is one of the cheapest places in Africa to travel to see mountain gorillas.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. A typical (local) fare for a short trip is around 500 Congolese francs.
The name "Timbuktu," with its slightly tongue-twisting quality, began to be used as a metaphor for exotic, far-off lands.
Currently, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, even though its reputation makes it a beautiful tourist destination and it has an airport.
Due to the threat of desert encroachment, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger sites in 1990.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special about the wonders of the African world.
This city noticeably differs from the rest of the country's cities, because it has a more Arabic flavor, even more than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and stretching along the length of the border, bounded by the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each supporting diverse wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's premier tourist destinations and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation and entry fees for the park.
Purchasing a Wild Card, which grants access to some or all of South Africa's national parks, might also be worthwhile.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and is a major focal point for many tourists.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline was likened to a luminous histogram, clearly visible thanks to the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the most spectacular views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This was land seized by British colonizers, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, extending inland 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
Sundarban was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarban National Park.
However, the forests include not only mangrove swamps, but also some of the last remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3850 km2, of which approximately one-third is wetland/swamp.
Designated a wildlife sanctuary in 1966, the Sundarbans are currently estimated to hold 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (over the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses to the districts are often full, it would be advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Small Japanese "Coaster" buses, which are comfortable and durable, serve many districts.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with the city of Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, with a length of 378 meters and two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational in September 2017, which is the expected completion date for Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group who lived as semi-nomadic hunters in present-day Eastern Paraguay and practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to indigenous groups, such as the Guaikuru and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the "immense province of the Indies Islands" in the 14th century, emerged as a result of encounters between Spanish conquistadors and local groups.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of the city of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain a significant part of its local character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Palermo.
Smaller competitions and meetings can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For information on where to buy tickets for tournaments and polo matches, check the "Asociacion Argentina de Polo" website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent to one British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located across from the "FIC West" store in Stanley.
The British pound sterling is generally accepted throughout the islands and within Stanley, with credit cards and US dollars also frequently accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, but British and United States currency may be; contact the owners in advance to determine an acceptable method of payment.
The Falkland Islands' currency is almost impossible to exchange outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures above +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make the air feel colder than the thermometer reads.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the zoo are used to seeing people, a wild animal is still a wild animal, and you should not feed or disturb them.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't maintain a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Furthermore, be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of slightly less than 40,000.
Founded in the 1850s, Apia has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
Gawan was the site of an unfortunate naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
Other than one British cruiser, every ship was sunk. Approximately 200 Americans and Germans perished.
A peaceful gathering in the city during the Mau movement's independence struggle resulted in the death of high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Oakland has many beaches as it is bordered by two bays. The most popular of them are located in three areas.
The beaches on the northern shore (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean coast and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy, with safe swimming beaches, and are mostly shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale urban fringe of Mission Bay, and in St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches with many different shops lining the coast, sometimes crowded. Swimming is safe here.
The main local beer is "Birinji", which is simple, pleasant, and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines might go down better.
Local tap water is generally safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is the norm. Short black is "espresso", cappuccino comes topped with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
The reef is visited frequently throughout the year, and reef damage due to any of those reasons is rare.
Even so, seek advice from the authorities, comply with all posted signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near coasts and river mouths north of the town of 1770 from October to April. They can sometimes be encountered at other times of the year as well.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Many sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their main habitat is located in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance assures the traveler that they will have a place to sleep upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also be able to hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (for example, a visa) for your destination.
Any changes or requests should be directed through the travel agency first, and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, a large number of people attending music festivals decide to camp on-site, and the majority of participants consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive early to set up camp near the music.
Don't forget that even if the music ends on the main stages, there may be parts of the festival where the music continues until late at night.
Some festivals have dedicated camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, check the location of your cabin, because traversing the ice produces a truly terrifying rattle for those most prone to seasickness.
St. Petersburg cruises also include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize the time and money guests spend. Often there are no windows or clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
To keep their guests happy and comfortable, they often have special food, drink, and entertainment options.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages at their own expense. However, intoxication hinders sound judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of being sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high altitudes or mountain passes should consider the likelihood of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive the car the same way you would on bare asphalt.
When snowstorms rage, enough snow can fall to bury you in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited by snow or blizzard conditions, or by fogging or icing of vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and road traffic often continues smoothly throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's greatest tourist attraction and are the main draw for many travelers.
In common usage, the term safari refers to a journey on land, especially in savanna Africa, to observe the amazing wildlife.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, are drawn to vehicles, and standard equipment will allow you to observe them well.
Tigers, leopards, and cheetahs can sometimes be shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "walking safari," or "foot safari") consists of a walking tour lasting several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the games in 1964, will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not extend to the postponed Olympic Games in July 2020.
Most event tickets are expected to range from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help dry them. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron or don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer if you have one.
Be careful, don't let the fabric get too hot (it can lead to wrinkles or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are various methods for purifying water, some of which are more effective against specific hazards.
In some places boiling the water for one minute is enough, while in other places several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned, consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Tourists may encounter unfamiliar harmful animals in their regions.
Pests can spoil food, causing bloating, or, in worse cases, lead to allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill people, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods in specific locations that are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Tourists going to countries with heavy taxes can often save a significant amount of money on alcohol and tobacco products.
The section of the Buffalo-Pittsburg auto trail between Point Marion and Fairmont has some of the most difficult driving conditions, frequently passing through isolated wooded areas.
If you're not used to driving on village roads, be prepared: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sudden turns prevail.
Posted speed limits are significantly lower than previous and subsequent sections, typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence to them is more important than non-compliance.
