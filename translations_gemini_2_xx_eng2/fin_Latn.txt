This reinforces the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but in addition, information was obtained that is not usually found in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
According to the researchers, the animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top and light or carotenoid-colored underneath.
Furthermore, the discovery helps to understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central shaft, known as a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics – such as barbs and barbules – researchers concluded that the rachis is likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flying, but rather for thermoregulation or courtship displays. Although it was a young dinosaur's tail, the researchers proposed that the sample came from an adult individual's plumage, not a chick's down.
Even though it was a young dinosaur's tail, the researchers suggested that the sample came from an adult individual's plumage rather than a chick's down.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the main police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.

It became clear to them that the Sun follows the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of the stars in all their systems was found to be due to luminosity and rotational and orbital motion, and not to anything else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less frequently polarity reversals occur in the star.

He added that "they should not, however, be burdened with obligations that exceed their level of development, responsibility and capacity."
The Baker-Hamilton Commission released its report today at 12:00 GMT.
The report warns that no one can guarantee that any action at this stage can stop the fighting between the religious sects, the increase in violence, or the drift towards chaos.
The report begins by wishing for an open discussion and the formation of a consensus on United States Middle East policy.
The report sharply criticizes almost every aspect of the executive body's current policies towards Iraq and calls for an immediate change of course.
The first of its 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be launched before the end of this year with the aim of securing Iraq's borders from hostilities and restoring diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

The work done was primarily theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team hoped to detect tidal effects between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon's gravity affects the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way's gravity affect the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy.
Researchers were able to deduce that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the galaxy's dark matter surrounds it in a kind of halo and consists of a large number of small particles.

Doctor Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In the interview, she said the new variant was very worrying and alarming due to its extremely high mortality rate.
Some patients may have contracted the infection in the hospital, Moll believes, and at least two of them were members of the hospital's healthcare staff.
During one year, a person infected with the disease can infect 10-15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB among all tuberculosis patients still appears low – 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 infected individuals annually in South Africa.

Based on infrared images, the daily temperature variations indicate that they are likely caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as uniform as in large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing, a member of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Science Center and a teacher at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally not been high-tech: voters go into a booth and place a pre-printed paper slip, on which they have marked their preferred candidate, into an envelope.
After the authorities have verified the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.
French electoral law has determined the course of events relatively precisely.
In 1988, ballot boxes were mandated to be transparent so that voters and observers could verify that there were no envelopes in the box at the start of voting and that no envelopes other than officially counted and authorized votes were added to the box.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the sequence of events. In the evening, volunteers will count the votes under strict supervision and following prescribed procedures.

In her second competition, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting class with a total time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 slower than the winner, Claudia Loesch of Austria, and 1:09.02 slower than Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary, who finished ninth.
Four skiers from the women's seated group were unable to complete their run, and 45 out of 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom did not receive a ranking in the competition.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Assistant Superintendent of Police D.K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused have been reported as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the defendants appeared in the courtroom with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been accused of his son's murder in Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
He is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but the eyewitness testimony may be tainted because his image has been widely publicized.
The practice is common elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system operates differently, and courts have found that publishing images could be prejudicial to a fair trial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee states that "journalists do seem to be treading a dangerous line if they publish photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, Scotland's prosecution service with overall responsibility for prosecutions, has led journalists to believe that it will not comment further on the matter, at least until charges are brought.
According to the leak, the document refers to a border dispute in which Palestine wants the borders to run as they did before the 1967 Middle East war.
According to reports, other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, a city sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement. The Palestinian Authority only accepts such a presence for five years.
The forest rangers were tasked with closely monitoring the shooters participating in the supplementary pest control trial, as the trial was being observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
Suitable volunteers were recruited as a joint project between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the NSW branch of the Australian Sport Shooters Association, and as part of the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director responsible for park conservation and cultural heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial cull received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Martelly recognized nine members at yesterday's meeting of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth interim electoral council in four years.
Last month, a delegation appointed by the President recommended the resignation of the previous interim electoral council as part of a package of measures aimed at leading the country towards new elections.
The delegation was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The demonstrations, which occasionally turned violent, originated from the unfulfilled elections, some of which were supposed to be held as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burn injuries to four individuals.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the equipment.
Last week, the ministry announced that Apple had reported 34 other overheating cases to it, which the company called "non-serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the investigation "very unfortunate."
An earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time on Friday).
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands' Emergency Management Office said that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there was no indication of a tsunami being generated.
A former Philippine police officer has held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released prematurely, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took an elderly woman's place when she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza died in the shooting.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a medical career.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature birth during his spare time.
Her studies showed that administering the hormone accelerates the development of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that the official investigation team had found two black boxes, or flight recorders.
Other wrestlers also showed respect to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a two-moon night. A very unique case, just like she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was as crazy as I am... maybe even more so... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 respondents was conducted prior to the 2010 federal election. The number of people opposing Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal parliamentary election campaign, caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic upon the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those who participated in the survey shared his view and wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the study, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic champion was supposed to participate in the Commonwealth Games' 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay races, but their fitness has been uncertain due to pain.
He hasn't been able to take the pain medication he needs because its use is prohibited in competitions.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the finding by early February using different devices and software, and it was reported on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Researchers hope to understand how planets are formed, and especially how the Earth was formed, since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political jawboning and ridiculous."
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration claims that NextGen is a system that allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older, ground-based radar technology. This allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more reliable information.
There will be no extra transport services, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley. There will also be no parking or Park and Ride services available at the stadium.
The concern about the lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported on the development of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University and Uppsala University reported that a new species had evolved in just two generations, although the sequence of events was believed to take much longer. The reason was the interbreeding of the native medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis) and the introduced large cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can also be beaten into tiny objects.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and it can be attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used in hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make a meter yourself using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (i.e., alkaline) a substance is.
The amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical indicates the pH value.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture from your hands reacts with the outermost layer, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Remnants of drainage systems have been found in Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where women and men bathed together in the same spaces.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a phone call and then reflects it back almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space aboard a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
A giant rocket, over 100 feet tall, is needed to take a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways. Much easier and faster movement is the greatest thing the bicycle has done for us.
It has given us a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them come the medium-sized felines, which eat medium-sized game, from hares to antelopes and deer.
Then there are also many small felines (including stray domestic cats) that eat small prey animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds, which exist in much larger numbers.
The secret to their success is the so-called ecological niche. According to this concept, each feline has its own specific role, which is why it does not compete with others.
Lions are the most social of the cat species, and they live in large groups called prides.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males, and sometimes up to thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave in much the same way as wolf or dog packs. These animals are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not to other big cats), and they too are very dangerous to their prey.
A tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (although not very well), swim, jump far, and pull five times as powerfully as a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same big cat genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four felines can roar.
A tiger's roar doesn't resemble a lion's full-bodied roar, but rather a sentence composed of growled, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can catch them. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Researchers believe that ocelots track and find edible animals, or prey, by sniffing the ground for their scent, revealing where they have passed.
Ocelots have excellent night vision, allowing them to see very well in the dark, and they move with remarkable stealth. They hunt by blending into their surroundings and then ambushing their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population it originated from (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or a river, or to a new island, making it difficult to return), its environment is often different than before.
The resources in a new environment are different, and the competitors are different, so to be a strong competitor, a new population needs different characteristics or adaptations than before.
The original population hasn't changed at all and still needs the same adaptations as before.
As a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, over time it will start to look less and less like the original population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations appear so different from each other that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of a new species. Speciation is a necessary consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe in, and they use carbon dioxide, which humans breathe out.
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. In addition, they provide shade.
We make things from plants for our house, and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws bristled with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and in addition to those, it had an extra row of teeth on the roof of its mouth, so nothing that crossed its path could escape.
We aren't certain, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water. Even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus rex wouldn't have stood a chance against it.
Most of their food would be familiar to us, but the Romans also had their own peculiar or unusual festive delicacies, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate their food sitting on chairs, but the rich preferred to organize communal feasts where they reclined on their sides while eating their meals.
At meals in ancient Rome, it was impossible to serve food that only arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
They didn't have, for example, corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People brought offerings to the gods, and priests sought to fulfill the gods' needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, the so-called Holy of Holies, which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes temples were built with pyramid-shaped towers, which were called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house was not as important.
The majority of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
The women were cooking food in the yard, and the shops were just open-air sales tables along the streets. Stone was used as the building material for the houses.
The land of Canaan did not have extensive forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living on the island at that time.

If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That is not true, however. Even though something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" are written on the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence. The writing is upside down at the bottom of the document.
No one knows for sure who wrote them, but it is known that the large parchment document (its dimensions are 29 ¾ inches by 24 ½ inches) was rolled up for storage in the early days.
So it is likely that the marking was added just as a kind of name tag.
D-Day, or the landings and subsequent battles, had liberated Northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was in the possession of the so-called Vichy France, that is, the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
The Allies invaded Southern France on August 15, 1944. The invasion's codename was Operation Dragoon.
United States and Free French forces liberated Southern France in just two weeks and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a culture shared by a large group of people, a society, living and working together cooperatively.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil or citizen. It is related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen or subject, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and it also kind of defines the size of a society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. Civilizational culture refers to the transmission of knowledge from one generation to another, a long-lasting cultural footprint, and a relatively large distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving sufficient historical evidence, so they are not usually considered proper civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states initially formed a weak central government – whose only part was the Congress – based on the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and lacking a national executive or judiciary, it had to rely on the often uncooperative authorities of the states to enforce all its ordinances.
It also did not have the power to change tax laws and interstate tariffs.
Amending the articles required unanimous approval from all states, and the states regarded the central government with such indifference that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful in the world. It won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, and Italians compete in them even in international matches and the Olympics.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island nation in the world!
Because the islands of Japan are in a cluster or group, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in a geographical sense.
Taiwan began to be known as early as the 15th century, when passing European sailors mentioned the island, calling it Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the indigenous population's grain production methods and employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty's (1644–1912) military forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing dynasty.
Having experienced defeat in 1895 in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: these are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings located on the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better understanding of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common size used in still photography is 35 mm. It was the dominant film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced, but above all, digital camera image sensor formats have inherited its aspect ratio.
Somewhat confusingly, the 35mm size is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, this size's aspect ratio (when divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) either match or are very close to this aspect ratio.
Often misused and much ridiculed, the rule of thirds is a simple guideline to create dynamism in an image while still maintaining some order.
According to it, the most effective placement for the main subject is at the point where the vertical and horizontal lines dividing the image into thirds intersect (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under close scrutiny.
Christianity had united the nations of Europe for over a thousand years, despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the core tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are specifically intended for such use.
The central power of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question the realization of the doctrine.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital supply deliveries to soldiers and civilians, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified by numerous international agreements over the previous two hundred years.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from accessing entire ocean areas, endangering even neutral vessels.
Because the tactic provoked only limited reactions, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, nations resolved to avoid a similar situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of depicting different periods: each phase or ruling family of China constituted its own dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty was an unstable period of provincial division. The most well-known of these periods was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles fought fiercely in pursuit of the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died fighting for the chance to sit on the highest throne in the magnificent palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political consequences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, official positions also became open to all male applicants. Thus, the most ambitious and successful could prosper.
The same applied to the army, as military ranks were now based on ability rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working classes of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammed was deeply interested in matters beyond the mundane aspects of everyday life. He often went to meditate in a cave, which became known as Hira and was located on the Mount Nur, meaning the Mountain of Light.
The cave itself, untouched by the ravages of time, vividly evokes Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on one of the mountains rising north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's very difficult to find, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, the isolation is complete.
Only a clear, beautiful sky is visible above, and many mountains surround. From inside the cave, very little of the earthly world can be seen or heard.
Located in the Giza Necropolis on the Giza Plateau in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, there are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), numerous smaller burial chambers, several temples, and the Great Sphinx of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures made in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Necropolis, located on the Giza Plateau in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The symbol for a rising draw looks like the letter V, and the symbol for a lowering draw is like a rivet or a square missing its bottom line.
Up-bow means you should start at the tip and push the bow. Down-bow means you should start at the frog (where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
An up bow usually produces a softer sound, while a down bow is stronger and firmer.
Feel free to add your own markings in pencil, but remember that the printed slur markings are in the music for musical reasons, so they should generally be followed.
A crowd of working-class women forced the horrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister Elisabeth to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in carriages, surrounded by a crowd shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to fully open the windows of their carriage.
At some point, someone in the crowd waved the head of a bodyguard killed at Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The Filipinos themselves had to pay for the war costs incurred by US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the United States colonial administration, which covered a significant portion of the costs, and to take care of the interest on bonds issued by Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
The fundamental benefit of United States imperialism, of course, consisted of the enormous profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos.
To understand the Knights Templar, one needs to understand the context in which the organization was founded.
The period of events is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history between 1000 and 1300 AD.
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages, which was followed by the Late Middle Ages, generally considered to have ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that, in practice, covers a wide range of ideas, from the so-called "push" of technology, or the inevitability of technology, to the absolute notion that human destiny is guided by a logic based on scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two basic ideas: first, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond the reach of cultural and political influence, and second, that technology, in turn, has inherent rather than socially conditioned "effects" on societies.
As an example, one could argue that the invention of the car inevitably led to the development of roads.
On the other hand, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to lower the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership leads to more accidents in road traffic, which in turn leads to the invention of new healthcare methods for repairing damaged bodies.
Cultural determinism was a significant element in Romanticism and was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was seen as shaping individuals. Over time, customs and culture typical of this geographical location were formed. Because these were in harmony with society, they worked better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe in the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
Its position weakened in the 12th century primarily because the crusaders had returned home with gifts like silk and spices, which were valued more than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
It was precisely at that time that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak between the turn of the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
Due to slow communication channels, Western European styles could, however, lag behind by 25–30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. As one of the most significant developments of the era, people began using buttons to fasten clothing as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is cultivation where enough food is produced only to support the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic-based system that uses seeds native to the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel rejected by societal norms, allowing them to develop their own identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished based on age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or the gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as its own and distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, related to gender or sexuality, geographical, or combinations of several different factors.
Often, members of a subculture communicate their membership through the characteristic and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and their own slang.
One of the most common methods to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to use as examples the few unfortunate children who, growing up, were deprived of the socialization provided by adults, either as a result of neglect, bad luck, or deliberate exploitation.
Such children are called "feral." Some children have been isolated by people (often their own parents). In some cases, abandonment has resulted from parents rejecting a child's serious intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some are said to have been raised by animals, while others are said to have lived on their own in the wild.
If a feral child has been raised entirely by an animal other than a human, they will behave (within the limits of their physical constraints) almost exactly like their guardian animal, for example, by showing similar fear or indifference towards humans.
The purpose of project-based learning is to make learning easier and more engaging. Timely learning support (scaffolding) goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a tool that supports individuals in a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Ladders can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a kind of ladder, but so is the little paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software, and its purpose is to pose questions, provide prompts, and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the learner without assistance.
Children are placed in foster homes for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that isn't nurturing, caring, and formative, but some do.
We consider the foster care system a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system aims to provide a safe home, loving guardians, consistent education, and reliable healthcare.
The purpose of placing children is to meet all of their basic needs that were lacking in their previous homes.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the internet add extra dimensions to the use theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as important effects of Internet use (James et al. 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new perspectives on motivations when examining audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, i.e., facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
It has been specifically claimed that by interpreting microexpressions correctly, it is possible to identify whether a person is lying.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks described how people who, due to brain damage, are unable to understand speech can nevertheless accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that some animals, such as domestic dogs, may have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
20th-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: cryptic and expressed.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuttle variation back and forth between these two stores every generation.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans would have difficulty getting enough amino acids from the plants available on the savanna.
Furthermore, being without them has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The easiest available plant resources would have been proteins from leaves and legumes, but primates like us have difficulty digesting them without cooking.
Instead, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is easily digestible, and in addition, it provides an abundant supply of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
Therefore, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption refers to intentionally waking up during a normal sleep cycle and falling back asleep a little later (after 10–60 minutes).
This is easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that restores awareness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other chronobiological approaches include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is known as a diuretic) before bed, thus forcing oneself to get out of bed to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive her vitality. It is possible for everyone to find perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but with the addition of the concept of Mahayana, or the Great Vehicle, as well as many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Visualizing deities cleanses energy channels, activates chakras, and develops awareness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which is why the Soviet Union and the United States cooperated. After the war ended, clashes of systems, procedures, and cultures led to a rift between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies, leading to the Cold War.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and there was real war, as proxy armies fought on battlefields in Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize in the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were nullified almost overnight when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced into the country, creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland. This was in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Navies have traditionally had the mission of ensuring that their own country retains the ability to move its own people and goods, while simultaneously disrupting the enemy's ability to move their own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mostly with submarines, tried to prevent this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have succeeded in conquering Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to easily obtain milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually raised in herds that roamed hilly terrain or other pastures. They were often cared for by goat herders, who were often children or young people, like the more well-known shepherds. These herding methods are still in use today.
Wagonways were already being built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the wagon roads consisted solely of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull wagons faster and with larger loads than on the slightly more uneven roads of the time.
Railroad ties were introduced quite early on to hold the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was understood that the rails would be more effective if they had a strip of iron on top of them.
The practice became common, but the iron wore down the wooden wheels of the wagons more.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transport was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago, when Homo erectus (or upright man) evolved.
The preceding Australopithecus did not walk upright as consistently.
Specialization in bipedalism is found in the 4.2–3.9 million-year-old fossils of Australopithecus, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join an environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering somewhat.
This is often like treating the symptoms of a disease, but if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we should find the root causes of the problems and eliminate them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and the problems have increased due to overpopulation and humanity's wasteful lifestyle.
After Congress approved it on July 4th, a handwritten copy signed by John Hancock, President of Congress, and Charles Thomson, Secretary, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
During the night, 150–200 copies were printed, which are now known as the Dunlap broadsides.
John Nixon read the document aloud publicly for the first time in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there's a lot about birds that still looks like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like tyrannosauruses.
In practice, all computers in use today are based on processing information encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits – or, in the professional jargon of computer circuits, bits.
Internal poisoning is not necessarily immediately obvious. Symptoms like vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made right away.
The most reliable sign of internal poisoning is a visible, opened medicine bottle or a container containing poisonous household chemicals.
Refer to the label for first aid instructions regarding this poison.
Entomologists use the term "true bugs" specifically for this group of insects.
The term stems from the fact that bedbugs used to be very common. Bedbugs are insects that are highly adapted to be human parasites.
Bed bugs and true bugs are both nest dwellers, adapted to living in the nest or shelter of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis, or MS, making it the most common neurological disease affecting younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS than men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of the child.
These couples can, if they wish, create an adoption plan for their little one.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to act as the child's parents.
The primary task of science is to ascertain how the world works using scientific methods. The scientific method, in turn, guides the majority of scientific research.
However, it is not only about performing experiments, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including the field of psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined in the West, it lost touch with its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in body structure and behavior often depend very essentially on the existence of endogenous cycles and their generation by biological clocks.
Seasonal rhythms, which are not merely reactions to external seasonal stimuli, have been observed in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue a free-running cycle of a certain period even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the most important pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments, either labeling the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, how important the part of the genome they have affected is, and whether they have affected germ cells or other cells.
Only mutations that occur in germ cells can be inherited by children, while mutations occurring elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural sites with the purpose of enjoying the scenery – including wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities at the destination include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits, and learning about ecosystem information.
One example is visiting Bornean orangutans, learning about them, and photographing them.
Every morning, the residents of small rural towns leave for work in their cars, and they are met by others whose workplace is where they themselves departed from.
In this kind of dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is somehow connected to and supports the private car-based transportation system.
Science is now providing indications that a massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere away from the stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, one rarely hears as many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail daily? Are traffic planners just incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is a field of study that examines the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave relatively consistently. Thus, traffic flows generally have reasonably good coherence and can be represented in a roughly mathematical way.
To better describe traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the following three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Understanding these relationships helps in the zoning, planning, and maintenance of road networks.
Insects were among the first animals to take flight. The ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back against their body.
This gives them a wider selection of small places to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and mayflies are currently the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, namely that the entire Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems logical, since the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, or does it?
The Amazon is the world's second-longest and largest river. It holds more than 8 times the water volume of the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, reaching a width of 6 miles at its widest point.
A full 20 percent of all the fresh water that flows into the oceans on our planet comes from the Amazon.
The length of the Amazon River proper is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size or construction skill of the Giza pyramids was never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the world's smallest independent state and the world's smallest state by population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
The majority of people working in the state speak Italian as their everyday language, but Latin is often used in religious services.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have been familiar with common chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they all occur naturally in their elemental form and because they are also relatively easy to extract using rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is composed of a combination of one or more elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more reminiscent of the four states of matter – in that order solid, liquid, gas, and plasma – but he also theorized that they transform into other substances to form what we see.
Metal alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like gold and silver.
There are also metal alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many when it came onto the market.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods have developed, the value and uses of the pencil have become more neglected.
Nowadays, messages are written on a computer screen, and you never have to reach for a pencil sharpener.
One can only guess what will happen to the keyboard once something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to form a nucleus consisting of many protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy again.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which makes them prone to decay with little or no prompting.
The Moon's surface is made up of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called its crust.
The Moon's crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side, visible from Earth, and about 100 kilometers thick on the far side of the Moon.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker in the highlands.
Dark mare areas may be more common on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories primarily focus on examining what motivates people's behavior or what appeals to them.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they have grown into adulthood.
These theories examine why some people want what they want, and what aspects of their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory are popular content theories.
When leaders start managing their former peers, two different behavioral patterns generally emerge. On one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
A leader like this will have difficulties making unpopular decisions, maintaining discipline, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At one end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the group has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the group's successes and failures.
Such behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are expected to deliver the same level of quality as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members act as liaisons for their immediate physical group.
They often have more decision-making power than regular team members because their teams may meet across different time zones and their local management may not always understand this.
The presence of a truly "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, 109) is also one of the unique components of a virtual team.
The Invisible Team is the management team to which all members report. The Invisible Team determines the required level of performance for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process that establishing a learning organization requires? One of the goals of implementing systematic learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently across all operating departments of an organization, creativity and innovation can emerge.
As a result, a process where an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process that serves the needs of its customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create an innovative culture and share information and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to studying consciousness, thereby narrowing the scope of research and making it much more exact.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the scientists' research.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain psychological functions.
The proliferation of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This way, we obtain a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes of our minds.
Although artificial intelligence is strongly perceived to be related to science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that studies machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Artificial intelligence research aims to enable machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These have become distinct disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-world problems.
Nowadays, artificial intelligence is frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, technology, and national defense, as well as being embedded in various software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of education. Often, the teacher would like to take the students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution: virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting at their desks.
Sharing a class trip virtually is an excellent way to reminisce about it and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. The site is updated annually, but its old versions are kept online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. In the early stages of students' blogging experience, grammar and spelling are often careless, but the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Because students themselves are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to make an effort to improve their writing and avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "forces students to understand the world around them better." The need to feed the readers' interest inspires students to be witty and engaging (Toto 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"The proper use of blogs 'can allow students to be more analytical and critical. By actively responding to internet materials, students can define their position against the background of other people's writing and bring out their own perspective on the question at hand' (Oravec 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, boasting a wealth of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north is, among other things, the untouched, scenic Muskoka.
These and many other factors create the impression of Ontario as a place that outsiders consider the epitome of Canada.
Large areas in the north are sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
The following demographic comparison may surprise many: the United States has more African Americans than Canada has citizens in total.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the largest of these and, in terms of its nature, is like its own continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or part of France, and they are known as luxurious beach destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them to the countries, and it gained considerable momentum in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women - All female travelers, regardless of their actual marital status, are advised to say that they are married.
Wearing a ring also helps (as long as it doesn't look too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can cause things that they might experience as harassment. It is not unusual for someone to start following behind, grab an arm, or similar.
Be firm when rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences do not legitimize harassment!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen, and it was used as a strategic port by Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids, who called it Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name Dar-ul-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping destinations in Morocco.
In the old medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products like tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide array of trinkets, but it's all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and buried most of its streets, especially in the city center.
Goma is reasonably safe, but all trips outside the city require preliminary investigations to determine the current state of ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano. You can also find some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trackers in Africa there.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. A typical (local) fare is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
When this is combined with its relatively difficult location, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
It was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger in 1990 due to the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the most important stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is a stark contrast to the country's other cities, feeling more Arabian than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park's area is 19,500 km², and it is divided into 14 different natural areas, each of which supports a different fauna and flora.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
A daily conservation and entrance fee is charged in the park, as in all South African national parks.
It might be useful to also buy a Wild Card, which grants access to either some South African parks or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong territory its name and is a major destination for many tourists.
Hong Kong's skyline, a procession of buildings, has been compared to a glittering bar graph that is best reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best parts of Hong Kong can be seen by leaving the island and heading to the Kowloon waterfront area on the opposite side.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban area is located on the densely built-up reclaimed land of the north shore.
This is precisely the place that British colonial masters adopted as their own, and if you're looking for signs of the area's colonial history, it's a good place to start.
Sundarban is the world's largest mangrove forest area. It extends 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on the Indian side is known as Sundarban National Park.
The forests are not just mangroves, however, but include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the entire Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is covered by water or wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 axis deer there.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar and Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
As local buses in the area are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdily built.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long, and it has two lanes each three and a half meters wide.
The underclearance of the bridge is 15 meters. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the schedule, the bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, which is when the Brazilian border posts are estimated to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant of the indigenous groups living in the area of present-day Eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers but also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who subsisted by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," was born in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the country's indigenous peoples.
The Spanish started the colonial era, which lasted three hundred years.
Since its founding in 1537 with Asunción, Paraguay has succeeded in preserving much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The year's biggest tournament will be held in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen in other seasons.
You can get news about tournaments and places to buy tickets for polo matches from the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Island pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP) at par.
Money can only be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outer islands, although British and US currencies may be valid. Clarify the accepted payment method by asking the owners in advance.
Exchanging Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands is nearly impossible, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, it has summer when the northern hemisphere has winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, and temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes the air feel colder than the thermometer reading.
There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Even though many of the park's animals are used to seeing people, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities advise staying at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from other wildlife.
Bisons, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack, even if they may appear very docile.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Please also keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or preparing strongly scented foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The infamous naval standoff occurred in the harbor in 1889, when seven ships – German, American, and British – refused to leave the port.
All ships sank, with the exception of one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost in the process.
A peaceful gathering held in the city during the Mau movement's independence struggle led to the death of High Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many sandy beaches there because Auckland is located between two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three different areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming, and pohutukawa trees provide shade on most.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in central Auckland.
They are sometimes crowded family beaches, and the shoreline is lined with a good selection of shops. Swimming is safe.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are several French wines worth trying, but New Zealand and Australian wines might hold up better during travel.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but cautious people can easily find bottled water.
The concept of a flat white-style milk coffee is foreign to Australians. A small black coffee is known as an espresso, and a cappuccino is served with a large amount of whipped cream instead of frothed milk. Tea is served without milk.
The cocoa meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many excursions are organized to the reef throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes are rare on the reef.
Therefore, heed the advice of authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found north of 17°70' near coasts and estuaries from October to April. Occasionally, they can also be encountered at other times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will likely swim away.
Estuarine crocodiles do not actually live in the sea, but their primary habitat is estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind knowing that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have deals on specific hotels, but it may also be possible to book other types of accommodation through a travel agency, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even combined flight and hotel deals.
They can also keep your reservation active if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, all changes and requests should be directed through the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and most participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even after the main stage music performances have finished, there may still be places at the festival where music continues to play late into the night.
Some festivals have separate camping areas for families with children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of your cabin, as traveling through ice can create a truly terrible noise in the worst parts.
St. Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos typically try their best to maximize the time and money customers spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and finding exits can be difficult.
They often have special food, drink, and entertainment offers to keep customers in good spirits – and on the casino premises.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks on the house. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high latitudes or in mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or extremely cold temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction, and you can't drive the same way you would on asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that a car can get stuck.
Snowfall or blowing snow, as well as moisture or ice accumulated on vehicle windows, may also reduce visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic usually operates year-round without interruptions.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's biggest draw and, for many, the highlight of their visit.
In popular parlance, the word safari refers to overland travel with the purpose of viewing Africa's magnificent wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and ordinary equipment is quite sufficient for observing them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a bush walk, hiking safari, and trekking safari) refers to a hiking expedition lasting either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, as it hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flight or accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, your situation may be difficult.
Cancellation policies vary, but based on the situation at the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were originally scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with tickets typically costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels offer the possibility to borrow an iron and ironing board, even if they are not in the room itself.
If an iron is not available, or if you don't particularly care about ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful that the fabric doesn't get too hot (as it may cause shrinking or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are various methods for water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others, several minutes are needed.
The efficiency of filters varies, and if you have any doubts, you should consider buying water from a reputable company in sealed bottles.
Travelers may encounter pests that they are not accustomed to in their home country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worse cases, allergic reactions, spread poison, and transmit diseases.
Generally, contagious diseases or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans are not considered pests.
Tax-free shopping refers to the opportunity to purchase goods in certain locations that are exempt from manufacturing and sales taxes.
Tourists heading to countries with heavy taxation may sometimes save significant sums of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The Point Marion to Fairmont section has the most challenging driving conditions of the Buffalo–Pittsburgh Highway due to its repeated passage through remote forest terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be careful: you'll encounter many steep inclines and declines, narrow lanes, and sharp bends.
Certain speed limits are significantly lower than on earlier and later sections – typically 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Oddly enough, the cell phone coverage is much better here than in many other places along the way, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds area.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and diverse, resembling the pastries of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common. Apple pastries are made year-round, and cherries and plums are popular fillings in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often taste especially good with a strong cup of coffee.
If you're craving small but hearty pastries, try one that, depending on the region, is called either Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices together with either meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries. In South India and some other coastal areas of the peninsula, coconut milk is typically used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines across the country.
However, if the term is used without further definition, it generally refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago and includes a large selection of simply seasoned dishes. The flavors favored by the Javanese include peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a wide variety of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are a rider's footrests that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but there can be safety concerns as the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, the runaway horse might end up dragging them. Various precautions can be taken to reduce this risk.
Firstly, most riders use riding boots with heels and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Some saddles, particularly English ones, have a safety bar that allows the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if a falling rider pulls it backwards.
Cochamó Valley – Chile's number one climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America. The valley features diverse, large granite walls and cliffs.
The views from the peaks are breathtaking. Climbers from all over the world constantly create new routes on its endless walls.
Downhill sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular sports where participants descend snowy terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to their feet.
Skiing is an important tourism activity, and many enthusiasts, sometimes referred to as ski bums, plan entire vacations around skiing in a specific destination.
Skiing as an idea is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers have been made as early as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport traces its roots back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski resort in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: this activity is also called ski touring, ski mountaineering, or cross-country ski touring.
It's related to alpine touring or mountaineering, but it doesn't usually involve that kind of terrain, as the latter is practiced on steep slopes and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as being like a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can progress somewhat faster than on foot, but you will very rarely reach the same speed as when skiing on groomed tracks and without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean filling out visa applications and going through passport control multiple times.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a single state in this respect.
As long as you stay within this area, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
When you have a Schengen visa, you also don't need to apply for a visa to each Schengen member state separately, which saves you time, money, and the hassle of paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured goods are antiques. Some tax authorities define all goods over one hundred years old as antiques.
The definition varies depending on geographical location. For example, in North America, more recent objects are considered antiques than in Europe.
Handcrafted items may be considered antiques even if they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture associated with it is also important to many people in other professions.
However, not even traditionally have all Sámi people engaged in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather they have lived off fishing, hunting, and similar livelihoods, and kept reindeer mainly as draught animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi.
Although the word "gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.
If your destination country is subject to a travel advisory, it may affect your travel medical insurance and trip cancellation insurance.
Perhaps it's worth seeking advice from other nations in addition to your own, even if their advice is intended for their own citizens.
As one example, Americans may face different situations in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
The briefings are just short summaries of a country's political situation.
The views presented are often superficial, generalized, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for all hazardous weather phenomena that may cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Dangerous weather can occur all over the world, and there are different types of it that can depend on geography, landforms, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, high rainfall, and wildfires are forms and consequences of dangerous weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal hazardous weather phenomena include blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the threat of hazardous weather affecting their destination, as it may impact travel plans.
All those who wish to visit a country that can be interpreted as a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for "Hostile Environment Course" will likely return the address of a local business.
The course usually covers all the topics discussed here in much more detail, and typically combines them with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2–5 days and includes role-playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Survival books and magazines focusing on wilderness areas are common, but publications dealing with war zones are rare.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of authorities to issue passports that do not indicate gender (X) or to update documents to reflect a preferred name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign authorities to respect these documents varies just as much.
Security checks have also become much more intrusive since September 11, 2001.
It should not be assumed that transgender people who have not undergone surgery can pass through security scanners while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are return flows of waves breaking on the shore. They are often found in reefs or similar locations.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow concentrates in a few deeper areas, and a rapid current into deep water can form there.
Most deaths are a result of exhaustion when trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you won't be swept away by the current again, or depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, it might be wise to wait for rescuers.
Reverse culture shock hits sooner than culture shock (the adjustment phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapted to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and already lost some of the customs of your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need time to adjust to a new country.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also important for travelers returning home.
The pyramids' sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and before the show starts, you can see them in complete silence.
Usually, one always hears the voices of tourists and vendors. The story of light and sound is just like a fairytale book.
The Sphinx is the backdrop to a long story and its narrator.
Scenes are performed against the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries have laid claim to the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, and they have the most bases there. In 2020, there were sixteen active bases.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which is home to the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the water-filled crater of a still-active volcano serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is an area bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea, located south of the Antarctic Peninsula.
There, the mountains of the peninsula merge into a plain, then rise again to form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
Located in the northern part, specifically in the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4,892 meters.
In remote areas with no mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, because to make a call you need to be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to the satellite.
The service is often used in seafaring, including pleasure yachts. It is also used by expeditions that need remote data and voice connections.
Your local telephone service provider can likely provide more information about connecting to that service.
Traveling and learning is an increasingly popular option among those planning a gap year.
It's especially popular among school graduates because they can take a gap year before university without their education suffering.
In many cases, participating in a gap year program abroad can even improve your chances of continuing to higher education in your own country.
Typically, a course fee is charged for participating in these tutorials.
Finland is an excellent boating destination. In the land of thousands of lakes, there are also thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a sailboat-sized boat in the archipelagoes and on the lakes.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and largest lakes are big enough for any boat, you get a different experience from smaller boats or even a kayak.
Boating is a common leisure activity in Finland, where there is a boat for every seventh or eighth person.
The ratio is the same as in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise very rare (e.g., in the Netherlands, the figure is one in forty).
Most regular Baltic Sea cruises include a longer visit to St. Petersburg.
This means you can visit a historical city for a few days and still return to the ship to sleep at night.
You do not need a separate visa if you only visit countries on excursions organized by the ship (2009 situation).
Some cruise brochures include Berlin, Germany. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, so a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced something traumatic.
There's no reason to be ashamed of it: it doesn't differ from many other people's fears and disgust towards some other things.
For some, having some understanding of how an airplane works and what happens during a flight may help overcome the fear stemming from ignorance or a feeling of helplessness.
Transport companies are paid well for fast deliveries. Speed is often very important for companies' documents, merchandise, or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
Larger companies have their own airplanes on some routes, but on other routes and for smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they shipped goods by air freight, unloading and customs clearance could take days on some routes.
The only way to get the item through faster was to send it as registered baggage. Airline regulations don't allow sending baggage without a passenger, so this is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to pay a hefty sum of money for the privilege (or perhaps preferably have your company do it for you).
However, it won't be cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the price for business class compared to economy class, and eleven times the price for first class!
For direct flights from location A to location B, it's generally not even worth looking for discounts on business class or first class seats.
Airlines know there's a core group of air travelers willing to pay a premium to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
The conflict led in 1994 to the self-proclaimed independence of the Transnistria Republic, located in eastern Moldova. It has its own government and currency, but no UN member state recognizes it.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey. Its population is approximately 3.7 million, it is the second largest port in the country after Istanbul, and it is a very good transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, developed, and bustling center of commerce, surrounded by mountains and spreading around a vast bay.
Amidst wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers, one finds traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market square, and old mosques and churches, even though the city's atmosphere is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
Haldarsvík has an unusual octagonal church, and the village offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy.
In the cemetery, there are interesting dove sculptures on top of some of the tombstones.
It's worth spending half an hour strolling around the fascinating village.
North of there, and easily accessible, lies the romantic and enchanting town of Sintra. Foreigners came to know it through Lord Byron's laudatory account, in which he described its splendor.
Scotturb bus 403 regularly goes to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
It is also worth visiting the large Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima to the north, which is world-renowned for the Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave and a site whose significance to a considerable portion of the Earth's population is almost immeasurable.
Even now, many men and women still live who survived being there, and many others whose loved ones were murdered there or forced to work themselves to death there, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
Remember to treat the place with all the dignity, gravity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the area by drawing or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understands it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is the primary official language by law.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also commonly used in public transport and other services.
The regular metro announcements are only in Catalan, but the automated system announces unexpected disruptions in many different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even though it's often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to be as decent as possible and behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). It makes getting around much easier.
The Parisians' rude exterior quickly disappears if you show ordinary politeness.
Plitvice National Park has a lot of forest, mainly beeches, spruces, and pines, and its vegetation is a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean plants.
There is a remarkably wide range of plant communities due to the diverse microclimates, varying soil types, and differences in altitude.
The area is also home to a remarkably large number of different animal and bird species.
In addition to more common species, you can find rare fauna there, such as bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wildcats, and capercaillies.
Women visiting monasteries should wear skirts that cover the knees, and shoulders must also be covered.
But if you bring your own scarf, especially a brightly colored one, you might get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men also need to be dressed in trousers that extend below the knee.
You can also borrow those from the entrance's cloakroom, but they aren't washed after every use, so you might not feel comfortable in those skirts. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like other cuisines in the Mediterranean zone, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil in everything.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is pa amb oli: bread with olive oil and tomato, along with any available toppings, such as cheese or tuna.
All nouns, and in addition the word "Sie" (meaning "you" in the formal sense), always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs from objects.
It can also make reading easier, although it complicates writing by requiring you to determine whether a verb or adjective is being used in its substantivized form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters C and G deserve the most attention, as their pronunciation depends on the following vowel.
Remember to also pronounce 'r' and 'rr' differently. "Caro" means dear, "carro" means carriages.
Persian grammar is quite easy and mostly regular.
Therefore, reading this grammar book would help in learning many things about Persian grammar and improve sentence comprehension.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, learning Portuguese is easier.
However, those with a little Spanish might suddenly imagine that Portuguese is so close that it wouldn't need to be studied separately.
Nowadays, old-fashioned observatories are not usually used for their original purpose, but have been converted into museums or learning environments.
Since light pollution wasn't the same problem in their heyday as it is now, they're usually located in cities or on campuses and are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations, and they are located in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
Cherry blossom viewing, or hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where the most popular flower was the Japanese apricot.
In Japan, the emperor held the first cherry blossom festival only for himself and other members of the aristocracy within the imperial court.
Plants look their best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just one" as a sample.
If you're in a formal and maintained garden, you'll be kicked out for collecting "samples" without any ifs, ands, or buts.
Generally speaking, Singapore is an extremely safe place to be, and it's very easy to find your way around. You can buy almost anything you need after you arrive.
But being in the heart of the tropics, just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to endure both heat (constantly) and intense sunshine (when the sky is clear, which happens less often).
In addition, a few buses travel north to Hebron, to the traditional burial site of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are about to board is actually going to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme around which to plan a vacation.
For example, a visit to the châteaux of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or a cruise to interesting cities along the Danube, or boating on the Erie Canal.
They also determine the routes of popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world have also adopted many traditions associated with the holiday.
According to tradition, Easter night is spent awake in an open space to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil service on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend. The congregation often bursts into celebration at the stroke of midnight to commemorate the Resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the island got there by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because the mainland was very far away, mammals were unable to survive the journey, so the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal of the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic region in winter, you will experience polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It offers a great opportunity to see the Northern Lights because the sky is dark almost around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore not a problem, you can also admire the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Suits are a common work outfit, and colleagues address each other by last name or title.
Harmony in the workplace is absolutely essential. Teamwork is emphasized instead of individual achievements.
Employees often need to get their manager's approval for all decisions they make, and they are expected to obey the manager's instructions without question.
