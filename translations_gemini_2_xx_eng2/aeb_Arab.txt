Despite the fact that there appears to be one experimental vaccine that can reduce Ebola deaths, until now, there is no good medicine to treat existing infections.
There was one antibiotic cocktail, ZMapp, that initially showed promise in this area, but formal studies showed that the benefit of this cocktail was less than the benefit they were looking for to prevent death.
In the PALM trial, they used the drug ZMapp as a control standard, meaning that the scientists set it as a baseline and compared the three other drugs to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the US Olympic Committee's mission and acknowledges the urgent need for the Olympic family to foster a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the statement of the US Olympic Committee that the interests of athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served if they engage in meaningful change within our organization instead of withdrawing licenses.

This not only confirms the widely held theory that some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides details that fossils generally can't, such as color and 3D arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top and pale, or the color of carotenoids, on the bottom.
The discovery also gives a greater understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers don't have a fully developed bony structure called a "spine," but they do have other feather characteristics—like barbs and barbules. Researchers discovered that the spine was mostly an evolutionary development that came after these other characteristics.
The wing structure indicates they weren't used for flight but for thermoregulation or display. Researchers suggest that although this tail belongs to a small dinosaur, the specimen shows feathers of a large one, not a small chick.
Researchers said that even though this is a small dinosaur tail, the features show adult bird feathers, not downy feathers.

They found that the sun operates on the same fundamental principles as other stars: and they concluded that the activity of all stars in the system stems solely from their luminosity and rotation.
They use photometry and rotation together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the lower the star's activity regarding magnetic variations.

802.11n speeds are much greater than the speeds of its predecessor, with a theoretical maximum output of 600 megabits per second.
Dufal, the married man with two grown children, made a big impression on Miller, who was the focus of the story.
Miller said when they asked him to give his opinion: "Mike talks a lot during the hearing... I was preparing myself, that's why I didn't hear what he was saying."
He spoke and said, "We will strive to reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by a good margin from now until 2020 compared to what it was in 2005."

The work that was done was mostly theoretical, but the program is being written to be like the notes that were taken on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team is investigating was caused by a tidal force between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way galaxy.
Just as the Earth pulls the moon to cause the tides, the same process happens with the Milky Way as it pulls on the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.
Scientists have managed to deduce that dark matter affects other dark matter exactly like normal matter does.
That theory clarifies that most of the dark matter surrounding a particular galaxy exists in the form of a halo, and is composed of many small objects.

In an interview, he said that the new, changing form of the bacteria "is very disturbing and frightening due to the extremely high mortality rate."
Dr. Mouel believes that some patients, including two workers from the hospital, may have contracted the virus in the hospital.
In one year, an infected person can transmit the disease to between 10 to 15 people who are close to them and who they interact with.
Despite this, the percentage remains low for drug-resistant tuberculosis among the group of people infected with tuberculosis; we find 6000 people out of 330000 people in South Africa who are sick at any given moment.

In France, voting traditionally is a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, and put a pre-printed ballot with their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter puts the ballot in the ballot box, and they mark (his name) on the voters list.
The French electoral law codifies procedures with an unpleasant difficulty.
From 1988 onwards, ballot boxes had to be transparent so that voters and observers could verify that there were no ballots at the beginning of the voting process, and also to ensure that no additional ballots were added except for those of registered voters who were duly authorized and mandated.
Candidates can send representatives on their behalf to witness every part of the process. And at night, volunteers begin counting the votes under intense supervision according to specific procedures.

California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger approved a bill that prohibits the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The draft law stipulates placing stickers with "18" written on them on violent video games sold in the state of California, and anyone who sells them to minors will be penalized with a $1000 fine per offense.
The Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, made a statement this morning and announced the trial of Huhne and Pryce.
He resigned and they're going to replace him in the cabinet with MP Ed Davey. It is expected that MP Norman Lamb will take the position of Business Secretary that Davey will be leaving.
Hohan and Price have agreed on a date to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16th.
The deceased were Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Koedodebak, 21 years old, who was driving.
Edgar Viguilla was injured in his hand and mouth, while Christopher Schneider needed reconstructive surgery on his face.
Schneider is suffering from constant pain, one of his eyes is blind, he lost a bit of his skull and they rebuilt his face with titanium. All this happened when the "Oka" weapon failed while it was aimed at the head of a fifth man.
Schneider gave his testimony via video link from a US Air Force base in his country.
After what happened on Wednesday, Karbanido competed in two individual races in the championship.
Her first race was slalom skiing, where she received a "Did Not Finish" result in her first run. 36 out of 116 competitors received the same result in this race.
And previously, in the giant slalom skiing race, she achieved tenth place in the women's sitting category with a total running time of 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place Austrian, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place Hungarian, Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female skiers from the disabled team failed to complete their stages, and 45 out of a total of 117 female skiers in the giant slalom race failed to achieve a ranking in the race.
The police in Pardes Hanna-Karkur recovered the stolen computer and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Butha Kanja, Rambro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused attacked the court with their faces covered.
Despite there being three people in the house when the car crashed into it, they weren't injured.
As for the driver, he received a major blow to the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, and emergency services extracted the driver from a red Audi TT.
They took him straight to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
From that time on, Adekoya appeared in Sheriff Court in Edinburgh, accused of killing her son.
She's currently being detained, awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be questionable because her picture has been published everywhere.
This is a very common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts considered that publishing the photos could be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee says that "it seems to me that journalists are heading in a dangerous direction if they publish photos or anything related to any suspect."
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for the claims, told reporters that there will be no further comments until the inquest.
And the document, according to the leak, will show the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 war borders in the Middle East.
Other topics they say they discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which we consider an important issue for both peoples, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding the continuation of the military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years, until they amend the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to this presence for only five years.
The guards needed to increase close supervision over those who launched the complementary pest control experiment; the experiment was under observation and they are evaluating its effectiveness.
In partnership between the "National Parks and Wildlife Service" and the "Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia", they selected qualified volunteers as part of the association's hunting program.
According to what Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), said, the four hunters who were selected for the first hunting operation received safety instructions and comprehensive training.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in to a new interim electoral council composed of nine members.
This is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council for Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the interim electoral council as part of a set of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests started, which sometimes turn violent, because they failed to hold the elections that were supposed to be held since 2011.
Approximately 60 incidents of "iPod" overheating malfunctions were reported, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last Friday, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of phones overheating significantly, which the company classified as "non-critical".
The ministry responded to Apple's request to postpone the report by saying it was "truly regrettable."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (Friday 09:19 PM GMT).
The Office of Emergency Management in the Northern Mariana Islands stated that they were not informed of any damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there are no indications of a possible tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman hijacked a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took two tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on the tourists with his M16 weapon.
Many hostages were rescued, and the death of at least six has been confirmed so far.
Six hostages were released early, including children and elderly people, along with the Filipino photographers.
Then the photographers took an old woman's place because she needed to go to the bathroom. And they opened fire on Mendoza.
His son followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Bed "Legins" investigated premature births in his spare time, when he was working at the hospital.
The research showed that administering a certain hormone accelerates lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered the flight recorders, known as the "black box," on Wednesday.
The wrestling colleagues remembered Luna fondly.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the original extreme queen. My first manager, Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. A strong, one-of-a-kind woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said: "Luna was as weird as me... maybe even more than me... We love her and we will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the percentage of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed agree with this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
Regarding the conflicting opinions in the survey, 29% of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist's fitness has been questioned due to his complaining, and he was required to swim 100m and 200m freestyle in three rounds at the Commonwealth Games.
He can't take the necessary medication to reduce the pain because its use is prohibited in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Many people verified the discovery using various devices and software starting in February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of delivering water to Earth along with organic materials that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists are keen to understand how planets formed, especially how Earth formed from the impact of comets a long time ago.
Komo is 53 years old, he started his rule at the beginning of this year and ratified a bill last month that legalizes same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
And he might run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration says will allow planes to fly on shorter routes, saving millions of liters of kerosene each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike the old technology that uses ground radar, to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint the aircraft's location more accurately and provide pilots with more specific information.
There's no extra public transport, and the underground trains won't be stopping at Wembley. There are also no car parks, parking facilities, or transport hubs.
The fear of a lack of transportation has raised the possibility that the match will be held without a crowd.
A study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" reported the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in America and Uppsala University in Sweden have said that the evolution of new species only took two generations - even though they believed that this process would take much longer - due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, the ground finch, the immigrant cactus finch, and the blunt-beaked ground finch.
Gold can be formed into many shapes. It can be damaged in small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin thread that is twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into the shape of leaves.
You can make it very thin, and stick it onto another metal. And it can be so thin that it used to be used sometimes to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
The pH of a chemical substance is called, and you can make an indicator for this pH using red cabbage juice.
The color of red cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substance.
The pH level is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance you want to test.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the dry ingredients together and squeeze them with clean, wet hands until they form a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, giving you a strange feeling and forming a kind of film.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with a drainage system in almost every house, connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.

When you contact someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it almost instantaneously.
The satellite is launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and the vision.
It requires a giant rocket, taller than 100 feet, to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in an amazing way; however, making an easier and faster means of transportation available remains its most important contribution to us.
She brought us the train, the car, and many other transportation devices.
Below them, there are other mid-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging between rabbits and gazelles and deer.
There are a lot of small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat a larger number of small prey, like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of hierarchy, a specific role for each cat that prevents them from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
A lion family consists of a male to three adult males, along with females and cubs, reaching a total of thirty.
Usually, the women are closer to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves like a pack of wolves or dogs, and surprisingly, these animals resemble lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior and kill their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (even if not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
Tigers belong to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar isn't as full-bodied as a lion's roar, but it's closer to a shriek with angry words.
The dwarf mongoose likes to eat small animals, and it hunts monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if it gets the chance. Almost all the animals that the dwarf mongoose hunts are smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and hunt animals using their sense of smell; they smell even when they are on the ground.
It can see well in the dark with night vision, and it also moves stealthily. The rusty-spotted cat hunts its prey by hiding in its environment and pouncing on them.
How do we separate a small group of living organisms (a small population) from the main population they belong to (for example, if they move across a mountain range or a river, or move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the environment they were previously in.
Given that this new environment contains different resources and competitors, the newly formed group needs different properties or adaptation methods to become a stronger competitor compared to its previous strength requirements.
Absolutely no change has ever happened to the original inhabitants, and they still need the same adaptation methods as we've always known them to.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, their similarity to other populations gradually decreases.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups become so different that we can't say they are of the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is considered an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their own food from the sun through the process of photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat also comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
The Mosasaurus was the dominant predator of its time, that's why it wasn't afraid of anything, except for other Mosasaurs.
The long jaws it had were studded with over 70 teeth resembling blades, along with another set in the roof of its mouth, meaning nothing that got in its way could escape it.
I don't know exactly, but perhaps he had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and he was probably a carnivore.
And it also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex couldn't handle it.
Despite knowing most of their cuisine, the Romans still had their share of strange or unusual Eid (feast) elements, such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their food sitting on benches, rich men liked to hold banquets together and would recline on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals did not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have legumes, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and the ancient Romans didn't eat turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, and it was considered the god's house.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to serve the gods in celebrations and holidays.
Each temple has an open courtyard that leads to a secluded, secure place that only priests can enter.
Unique clock towers in the shape of pyramids, called Ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The summit of the tower was a safe haven for the god.
In the warm Middle Eastern climate, the home wasn't of great importance.
Most of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
The women used to prepare spices in the courtyard of the house, the shops were just open counters facing the street, and they used stone to build the houses.
There weren't big forests in the land of Canaan, that's why wood was expensive.
Humans populated Greenland sporadically. The Norse sagas recount how Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter, and how he sailed west, discovered land, and named it Greenland.
Regardless of its discovery, Inuit tribes used to live there before.
There were significant differences between the people, kings, customs, and history in the countries of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, even though they were all "Scandinavians".
If you've watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was imagined on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Despite there being something written on the back of the paper, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is written the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the paper, upside down.
Although the author of this part of the text isn't known specifically, we know that the large manuscript (which measures 29¾ inches × 24½ inches) was stored folded at the beginning.
Therefore, it's likely that the symbol was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was not yet liberated at that time.
France was ruled by "Vichy". They are the same French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France and called the invasion "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans liberated the Free French Forces in the south of France and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization is an individual culture shared among a large group of people who live and work cooperatively with each other.
The origin of the word "civilization" is from the Latin "civilis," which means civil, and which is related to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state. This also defines the way a community is structured.
Self-governing cities are like the ancestors of nations. Civilizational culture means transferring knowledge across many generations, leaving behind a lasting cultural imprint, and spreading knowledge in a fair way.
Many small cultures are disappearing without leaving any real historical evidence and are not recognized as real civilizations.
In the Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies formed a weak central government - the Congress existed under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the authority of the states, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
Furthermore, he didn't have the authority to override tax laws and tariffs imposed between the states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all states before they could be amended, and the states mocked the central government to the point that their representatives were always absent.
The Italian national team, along with the German national team, are the second most successful teams in the world in football and were World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and the Italians used to compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island country in the world!
Because of the group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often called - from a geographical perspective - an "archipelago".
Taiwan began to appear on maps in the 15th century, and European sailors who passed by it called it "Ilha Formosa," or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began changing indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War between 1894 and 1895, the Qing government amended the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
The city of Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the House of the Three Windows.
The majority of the existing buildings were rebuilt on the edges of the complex to give tourists a better idea of how it originally looked.
In 1976, they recovered thirty percent of Machu Picchu, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the standard format for still photography known around the world is 35 millimeters, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
Its production is still ongoing to this day, but more importantly, the image sensors in digital cameras have the same aspect ratio.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this image is 3:2 (which you get by dividing by 12 to get the simplest whole number ratio).
This aspect ratio is equal to or close to many common formats (like Advanced Photo System formats).
The rule of thirds, which is often misused and mocked, actually provides a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in a clear image.
The most impactful location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was subjected to scrutiny during this period of European history.
The Christian religion tied European countries together for over a thousand years, despite differences in language and customs.
And the all-encompassing power that she possessed affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
Among the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds exist specifically for this reason.
For over a thousand years, the central authority resided with the Church in Rome. This concentration of power and money led many people to question the extent to which it fulfilled the requirements of the faith.
Britain quickly began blockading Germany by sea after the skirmishes started.
The strategy proved its effectiveness by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, despite the fact that this blockade violates international law generally accepted and codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sections of the oceans, which threatened even neutral ships.
Because the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes among most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the countries wanted to avoid this situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to work with Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of presenting its different time periods; each phase of China or each dynasty in power was of a different type.
Moreover, between each ruling dynasty there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, a fierce war broke out between many nobles to seize the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, and thousands of people died in wars for control of the highest positions in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political impacts, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to a republican system, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not solely to the ruler.
After the revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, and those with more ambition were allowed to succeed more than others.
The same applies to the army, because army rankings, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to ignite their own revolutions.
Mohammad was very interested in matters that transcended this earthly life. He got used to visiting a cave, later called "Hira," on top of Mount "Al-Nour" in order to contemplate.
This cave, which has remained throughout the ages, gives us a vivid and clear picture of the Prophet Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the summit of a mountain in the northern mountains of Mecca, and it is very isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, finding it wasn't easy at all, even if you knew it existed. And once you enter the cave, you become completely isolated.
You can't see anything but the clear, beautiful sky above the mountains in this place. And you can't hear or see anything but a few things from this world inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands to this day.
The Egyptians built it in the 3rd century BC. The Great Pyramid is just one of the large pyramids built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, has many pyramids (the Great Pyramid is the largest one), small tombs, temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upstroke" symbol looks like the letter V, and the "downstroke" symbol looks like a stapler or a square without the bottom side.
The upper mark means you have to start from the edges and push the bow, while the lower mark means you have to start from the end of the bow (meaning, hold the bow with your hands) and pull it.
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger.
Don't hesitate to sketch your markings with a pencil, but don't forget that the crooked printed markings are there for a musical reason, that's why you should usually respect them.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their young children (Marie Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis Charles, 4 years old), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, found themselves forced to return from Versailles to Paris amidst a clamorous crowd of market women.
They returned to Paris via Calais, surrounded by many people shouting and protesting against the King and Queen.
And a group of fans succeeded in forcing the king and queen to dissolve their youth branch (or youth organization).
At a specific time, one of the gang members threw the head of one of the slain Royal Guards in Versailles in front of the grieving Queen.
The Filipino people are the ones who bore the costs of America's imperialist war when it invaded the Philippines.
These people were forced to pay taxes to the American colonizer in order to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds that were made in the name of the Philippine government on Wall Street.
And of course, the very large profits that come from exploiting the Filipino people for a long time will be the most important gain for American imperialism.
We need to understand the context that allowed the organization to exist in order to comprehend the Knights Templar.
The era in which those events took place was called the High Middle Ages, which is a period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages came after the Early Middle Ages and before the Late Middle Ages, with the entirety of it roughly ending in the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a large collection of ideas in practice, from technology push or technological imperative to the certain feeling that there is a basic logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology that controls human destiny.
There are two common general ideas shared in most interpretations of technological determinism: that technological development is autonomous, following a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that this technology also has "effects" on static societies, not those connected to society.
For example, there are those who say that the car engine will lead us to the development of roads.
However, building a road network across the entire country for a few cars doesn't bring economic profit, that's why new roads are being developed to lower the cost of car ownership.
Collective car ownership also increases the rate of road accidents, and this generates new technologies in healthcare to treat damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a significant importance in the cultural determinism brought about by writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of the Romantic movement, geography is what brought people together, and with time came the customs and culture related to that particular geography, and these were, being in harmony with the community's place, better than laws imposed by force.
Paris is also famous for being the fashion capital of the contemporary world, and Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It began to be known as a center of luxury in the year 400 AD and remained so until 1100 AD.
And its value declined in the twelfth century due to the return of the Crusades, and it came back with its gifts like silk and spices, which had a value better than what was available in the Byzantine markets.
And at this time, Paris was named the capital of fashion, replacing Constantinople.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries, and even up to the 14th century.
Initially, Byzantine culture in the East greatly influenced clothing.
Despite that, and because of censorship on communication channels, trends in the West can be delayed by approximately 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at that time was, due to the Crusades, people started using clasps to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is the type of agriculture that people practice in order to produce just enough food to feed the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming - which is often organic - is a simple system where they use stored seeds that are suited to the region's climate, along with crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase production.
Most farmers used to work in subsistence agriculture, and this situation still exists in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms, allowing them to develop their sense of identity.
Subcultures are likely to be distinctive due to age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture's distinctiveness can be language, appearance, religion, politics, gender, geography, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures demonstrate their membership through their clothing, behavior, and the language they speak.
Among the many well-known methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization, some rely on tragic cases of children who suffered when they were neglected, had terrible luck, or were deliberately harmed, and who were not socially connected to adults during their upbringing.
These children are called "the wild ones" or "the feral ones." Some people have taken in some lost children (usually children whose parents are missing); in some cases, the neglect of the children was due to the parents rejecting the child's significant mental or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced bad treatment in their childhood or strong traumas before they were neglected or ran away.
And there are others who say that animals raised them; and there are a few others who say that they lived in the forest alone.
When a child is raised by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limitations) that closely resemble those of their caregiver animal, such as fear of humans or indifference towards them.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make the learning process easier and more important, the support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning is not a method of learning, but rather a tool that provides support for individuals going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual or in person; in other words, a teacher is a form of interactive learning, as is the paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
The program internally supports interactive learning and aims to pose questions, motivate, and explain procedures that students may find difficult to handle independently.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to even blackmail.
No one, not even a child, should grow up in an environment that doesn't foster nurturing, care, and education, but they are growing up like that.
He knows that the foster care system is considered a safe zone for minors.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Alternative care must provide all the necessities that they lacked in the homes they came from before.
The internet combines aspects of both mass and personal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and gratifications approaches.
For example, some suggest "learning" and "socialization" as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Amy and McCord (1998) identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivational aspects when they studied the public's reaction to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last for a fraction of a second.
And they say, especially, that a person can figure out if someone is lying if they interpret the small expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks pointed out in his paper that the president's speech suggests that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to accurately assess sincerity.
And also touch on the idea that these abilities in analyzing human behavior are shared with some animals, like domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown the existence of two groups of genetic variations: a hidden group and a visible one.
Mutation increases new genetic variations, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination make the variation random and not directed between the two populations with each generation.
In the savanna, primates with digestive systems similar to humans find it difficult to meet their amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure in this will lead to dire consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The plant resources that were easily accessible in abundance were the proteins that could be obtained from leaves and legumes, but these proteins are difficult for primates like us to digest if they are not cooked.
Conversely, animal foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide proteins in high quantities and contain all essential amino acids.
Taking everything into account, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in some way, like chimpanzees in the savanna.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of deliberately waking up during your natural sleep period and going back to sleep after a short period (10 to 60 minutes).
You can do that easily by using a gentle alarm that slowly brings you back to consciousness without waking you up abruptly.
If you find yourself refilling the alarm while you're asleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you don't have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other bio-based options include drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic), spaced out so you have to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The less stress, the more positivity that gives you the strength of life. Everyone has the inherent ability to find peace and complete satisfaction.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that prevents them is our stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it expanded through the Mahayana path of love and other techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is extremely simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path of love that embraces everyone.
Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chanting, and visualizations, with "Kundalini Yoga."
The Tibetan Meditation Center is the God Yoga. By visualizing the different deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany represented a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. However, with the end of the war, the clash of systems, procedures, and cultures led to the outbreak of conflict between the two countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
This war was supposed to last forty more years, with the fighting taking place on the ground, through proxy armies, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, and in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of cargo ships is considered the most effective way to transport many people and goods across the oceans.
Tradition dictates that the navy's mission is to ensure your country's ability to transport its people and goods, but at the same time, it impedes your enemy's ability to transport their people and goods.
A prominent modern example is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II, where the Americans tried to transport people and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to counter this invasion, relying on submarines in this matter.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have entered Britain like it did with the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated nearly 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes started raising them (referring to animals) because they easily provide milk, wool/hair, meat, and hides/skins.
The domestic goats were generally raised in herds, grazing in the hills and other pasture areas, often tended by goat herders who were mostly children or teenagers, like the typical shepherd. And these grazing methods are still used today.
Playing cards were developed in England in the 16th century.
Despite the old horse-drawn wagons being made of parallel planks, they allowed horses to pull them, making them run faster and carry a greater weight compared to sledges, which were considered very difficult at that time.
They invented the train tracks' iron a bit thicker in the past to stabilize the routes, but it later became apparent with time that putting a rail above the track makes it more effective.
This became like a tradition they follow, except that the metal ate away at the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In the end, they replaced the wooden wheels with iron wheels. In 1767, they used the first complete iron bars.
Walking was the first means of transportation; humans started walking upright two million years ago, coinciding with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright consistently.
Fossil remains of bipedalism were found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be active in order to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is exactly like treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems, and we need to put an end to them.
It's very clear that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and the problems have grown due to the population increase and the luxurious lifestyle of humans.
After its adoption by the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, corrected by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to the printing press of John Dunlap, which was a little nearby.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlop's Cash Newsletters".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8th.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy of it reached London on August 10th.
The Dunlap broadsides, of which twenty-five remain, are the oldest surviving copies of the American Declaration of Independence document, but the original handwritten version did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still show how they are like dinosaurs.
It has legs with layers of external protection and claws, it lays eggs, and it walks on its two legs like a Tyrannosaurus.
Virtually all computers used today rely on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary digit can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these digits are referred to as binary digits - or bits, if we're using computer jargon.
Internal poisoning symptoms might not appear immediately. An immediate diagnosis cannot be made until symptoms such as vomiting appear, which are general enough.
A possible sign of internal poisoning is finding an open packet of medication or household chemicals.
Check the label to learn about the first aid instructions specific to the poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This word comes from the old knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both "assassin bugs" and "bed bugs" are known for their long incubation periods and their adaptation to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it one of the most common neurological diseases among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research indicates that females are twice as likely as males to develop multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to create an adoption plan for their children.
In the adoption process, the original parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
However, despite that, she's not unique in this subject; experimentation and the experimental method are considered tests that can be used to refute one or more potential hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on ancient texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
I accepted Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology.
At the time when knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms encountered in physiology and behavior at various times depend on self-generated cycles and their production via biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic cues, have become firmly established in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that continue for periods of successive cycles even when there are no external influences.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to inject their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to label either the bacteriophage's DNA using radioactive phosphorus or its protein using radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a diverse range of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells or not.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas who like to enjoy the scenery, including wild plant and animal life.
Examples of activities that can be done at a fishing site include fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting gardens, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning information about this type of monkey (orangutan) in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns in their cars to go to work and they meet other workers on the road in the same area they just left.
In this vibrant mode of transport, everyone somehow supports and is connected to a transportation system based on private carts.
The science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from one of the stable states that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone in the community participates and uses the transportation systems. But everyone complains about the transportation systems.
You rarely hear in developed countries levels like this of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamentally going on?
Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow analysis is difficult because you can't predict driver behavior one hundred percent.
Luckily, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable pattern; that's why traffic enjoys a reasonable pattern and can be expressed mathematically in an approximate way.
To better illustrate the flow of traffic, relationships were established between three key properties: (1) Flow, (2) Density, and (3) Speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape from predators more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are characterized by their ability to fold their wings along their body.
And this gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that can't fold their wings today are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some saw him as right, but many people believed the opposite: that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems logical, because you don't feel the earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It contains more than eight times the water volume of the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, reaching a width of 9.66 km in some places.
20% of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite the fact that pyramid construction using stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, the pyramids at Giza remain unmatched in terms of size and artistic distinction in construction.
The Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which had remained for over a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and has the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also a language of daily life used by most state employees, while Latin is typically used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, and all these elements can be discovered in nature in their original form and extracted relatively easily using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle posited that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although Zada also assumes that they transform into new materials to form what we observe.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered minerals. And there are naturally occurring minerals like silver and gold too.
You can also obtain alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can fit in the space of the dot at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was a great friend to many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing tools, the use of the pencil has decreased and its status has fallen.
Nowadays, people write messages on the computer without using a pen.
And one wonders what will become of keyboards when something newer than them comes along.
A fission bomb works by gathering energy to create a nucleus full of protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy cart uphill. The core splits again and releases a bit of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to decay with a small amount of movement or something else.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 kilometers wide on the near side and 100 kilometers wide on the far side.
Lower display under Maria and display under Heights.
There might still be lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to reach the surface.
You search for content theories and you don't find anything that excites people or attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that only appear when they reach them (a certain age/stage).
These theories explore the need that makes some people love the things they do, and the things in their surrounding environment that make them do, or not do, certain things.
Two common theories for content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can appear when managers lead their former colleagues, one of which is trying to remain like the others.
This type of manager struggles to make tough decisions, implement disciplinary actions, conduct performance reviews, assign responsibility, and hold people accountable.
On the other hand, the person transforms into someone you no longer recognize, feeling that they need to change everything the team was doing and possesses.
In the end, the leader is primarily responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical groups.
They often had greater autonomy than members of traditional teams, and their teams could assemble according to different time zones, which might not be understood by their local management.
(Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) describe the existence of a real "shadow team" as a unique component of a hypothetical team.
Each member submits their reports to the management team, the "Invisible Team," and the "Invisible Team" sets the standards for each member.
Why would a specific organization want to establish an educational organization in a process that takes a long time? Innovation is one of the goals of implementing institutional learning concepts.
When you effectively utilize all available resources through the departments in the organization, we can see creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, synergy within the organization can be fostered to overcome obstacles in establishing new, innovative procedures that meet the needs of the clients.
Before the organization is capable of innovating, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
In Angel (2006), he explains the continuity approach as a method they use to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neuroscience data provides concrete evidence for the theoretical approach in epistemology research. This helps to narrow the scope of research and make it much more precise.
Supporting the connection between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
New technologies allow us to see and explore the structures and processes of the brain in a way we never knew before.
This provides us with a lot of information and the materials to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has strong connotations of science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science, and it deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
Research in artificial intelligence involves creating machines to perform tasks that require intelligent behavior automatically.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and furthermore, it can recognize handwriting, voice, and faces.
These things have become separate fields that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are currently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, just like they're used to create many applications on home PCs or video games.
Field trips are considered a big part of any department. Often, the teacher wants to take her students to places where going by bus is completely out of the question.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or enjoy beautiful art while sitting with their classmates in the classroom.
Plus, creating a virtual field trip is a great way to remember a specific trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website for their trip to the state capital, and they redesign this website every year, but they keep the old versions online to serve as a register.
Just as blogging can help improve student writing. While students often start their blogging experience with incorrect grammar and spelling, having an audience generally changes that.
Given that students are often the most critical audience, the person writing the blog should start looking for ways to improve their writing so as not to be criticized.
Blogs push students to become smarter than their peers. The need to capture the audience's attention inspires students to be brilliant and useful (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that allows for collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can "enable students to become more capable of analysis and critique; and by responding effectively to what is online, students can determine their positions regarding what others write, in addition to being able to form their own opinions regarding specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada, with two languages and a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is found in the far south, and in the north, we find the beautiful "House of Nature" in Maskouka and the one after it, which are not being exploited.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as the go-to Canadian destination for foreigners.
The large areas in the north are regions with relatively few inhabitants, and some of them are almost uninhabited.
For the sake of comparison regarding striking population figures: The number of African Americans residing in the United States is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa in the Indian Ocean are located off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island of all, and it's an independent continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent countries, or they are linked to France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs carried Islam to the country and spread it widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the fifteenth century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a sea route from Europe to India via the Cape.
The African coast borders the region from the north, and the Atlantic Ocean borders it from the south and west.
Women: Regardless of their marital status, women who are traveling must declare if they are married.
Wearing a ring is very beneficial (but not one that's too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that they are used to being watched, grabbed by the arm, and so on.
Be difficult when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand firm in your opinion (don't let cultural differences be something acceptable!).
The Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids used the city of Casablanca as a strategic port called "Anfa," after its establishment on the route of Berber sailors in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed it, then rebuilt it and named it "Casa Branca" (White House), only to flee it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name Dar al-Baida, and Spanish merchants, who established trading posts there, called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is considered one of the places in Morocco where they shop the least, compared to the rest of the country.
It's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods all over the old city, like tagines, pottery, leather, shisha, and all kinds of cheap goods, but it's all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, covering most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Any visit outside of Goma requires you to do your research to understand the ongoing state of war in the province of North Kivu, at a time when Goma is reasonably safe.
The city is considered a base for ascending to the Nyiragongo volcano and one of the cheapest ways to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma, and the usual price (locally) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Besides being a bit difficult to reach, "Timbuktu" has become a term used to refer to faraway and exotic lands.
The city of Timbuktu is now considered a poor city, despite its reputation making it a tourist attraction, and it even has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major stops for Henry Louis Gates in his PBS series on the African world's wonders.
The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country's cities because it's characterized by a more Arab than African character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park's area is 19,500 square kilometers and it's divided into 14 different ecological zones, each one with its own unique wildlife.
It is considered one of the most attractive places in South Africa, and its park is also considered one of the main national parks in South Africa (South African National Parks).
There are daily pictures for the conservation of the park and entry to it, like all the national parks in South Africa.
It might be useful for you to buy a Wild Card, as it grants you access to a selection of South African parks or all of South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong territory its name and is the place considered a destination for many tourists.
The stacked buildings that picture the Hong Kong skyline resemble a sparkling graph displayed above the Victoria Harbour water.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and walk to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers made as their own place, so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of the region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is considered the largest mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) into the remote coastal regions of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A part of the forest located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests aren't just mangrove swamps; they hold some of the last remaining evidence of the dense jungles that once covered the Ganges River plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 square kilometers, almost a third of which is covered by water/swamps.
From 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and estimates say that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (near the river) around midday, although most of them, especially those heading east to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Because buses between neighborhoods are often full, it's best to buy tickets in advance, a few days ahead.
Most areas are served by small Japanese "coaster" vans, which are comfortable and reliable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to get around to nearby places, like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the bridge is 83 meters, its length is 378 meters, and it has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The works were completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
It's been decided that the bridge will begin operating at full capacity in September 2017, at the same time that the Brazilian customs points are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is known today as eastern Paraguay. The Guarani lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes like the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting animals, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay emerged, previously known as "The Giant Province of the Indies" as a result of the confrontation between Spanish colonists and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonial era that lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competitions of the year are held in December, at the Las Canitas polo tournaments.
In addition to that, you can watch smaller tournaments and matches here at other times of the year.
To get news about championships and places to buy polo match tickets, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is valued the same as the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the island, located in Stanley, on the other side of the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere in the islands and on Stanley credit cards, and the US dollar is accepted a lot of the time.
In remote islands, there's a chance they might not accept credit cards, even though they might accept British Pounds and US Dollars; confirm with the owners beforehand to know how to pay.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, which is why you need to exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, summer there will be winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; it's normal for temperatures to exceed 30 degrees Celsius during the summer months.
The winter can be deceivingly cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make the weather feel colder than what the thermometer reads.
The amount of rainfall remains fairly constant throughout the year, with no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons.
Even though many animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife is ultimately wild and shouldn't be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and nearly all large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors get injured every year because they don't leave a safe distance. These animals are big, wild, and considered dangerous, and that's why you need to give them their personal space.
In addition to that, be careful because smells attract bears and other wild animals, so don't carry or cook food with strong smells and maintain the cleanliness of the camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, and this city is located on the island of Upolu, with a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and was the official capital of Samoa from 1959.
The port was the site of bad naval confrontations in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank except for one British cruiser. Approximately 200 American and German people drowned.
In the struggle organized by the Mau Mau movement for independence, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the assassination of the supreme leader Tubou Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to Auckland being located between two harbors, there are many beaches, with the most popular ones found in three places.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most of them are shaded by bougainvillea trees.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are located on both Waitemata and in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches get crowded at times and have a good selection of shops lined up along the beach. Swimming is safe.
The basic, popular beer is known as "Numero Uno." It's not a complex drink, but it's a beverage that gives you a buzz and refreshes you. The other local beer is called "Celtia" (or "Manta" - depending on regional dialect).
There are many types of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wines are on another level.
Local tap water is drinkable, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. Small black coffee is "espresso", and cappuccino has a layer of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent, even though they are expensive.
Many excursions to the coral reefs are organized throughout the year, and the coral reefs are rarely damaged for any of these reasons.
However, seek advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The jellyfish are present near the coasts and river mouths from October to April north of 17°70. You can find them occasionally at other times.
The roc is real, but it rarely attacks humans. Most rocs are afraid of humans and flee far away if they see one.
Saltwater crocodiles don't usually live in the ocean; their primary habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
A reservation assures the traveler that they will have a place to sleep as soon as they reach their destination.
Although you may find that it is possible to reserve other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent, travel agents often have deals with specific hotels.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even all-inclusive packages that include flights and hotels.
They can hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or get other documents for your destination (like a visa).
Despite that, you need to send any modifications or requests through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
Regarding some festivals, most attendees at music festivals decide to camp on-site and consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the events, you need to arrive early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that although the music might be over on the podium, there are parties from the festival that continue the music until later in the night.
Some festivals include camping areas specifically for families with young children.
When crossing the northern Baltic Sea region in winter, it's necessary to check the location of the cabin, as passing through ice causes a very high sensation for people who are more isolated and affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises include spending some time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements for entry (see conditions).
Casinos usually try very hard to increase the time and money that guests spend. Usually there are no windows or clocks, and you might find that exits are difficult to find.
They have a tradition of special meals, drinks, and entertainment to keep their good guests happy and keep them coming.
Some places offer alcohol for free, but intoxication greatly impairs good judgment, and all serious gamblers know the importance of staying sober while gambling.
Anyone driving their car at high altitudes or on mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snowfall, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there isn't much friction and you can't drive on a slippery road.
And in snowstorms, a quantity of snow can fall that will stop you for quite a while.
Snow, freezing rain, or ice accumulating on your car windows can reduce visibility.
