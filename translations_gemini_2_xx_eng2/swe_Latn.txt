Dr. Ehud Ur, professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and chair of the clinical and scientific section of the Canadian Diabetes Association, cautioned that the research is still in an early stage.
Like some other experts, he is skeptical about whether diabetes can be cured, and points out that these results are not relevant to people who already have type 1 diabetes.
On Monday, the Swedish Academy's permanent secretary Sara Danius announced publicly during a radio program on Swedish Radio that the committee had been unable to reach Bob Dylan directly regarding the acceptance of the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature, and that it had therefore given up its attempts to reach him.
Danius said, "Right now we're doing nothing. I've called and emailed his closest colleagues and have received very friendly responses. That certainly has to be enough for the time being."
Rings CEO, Jamie Siminoff, previously pointed out that the company started when his doorbell couldn't be heard from his workshop in the garage.

The US Gymnastics Federation supports the US Olympic Committee's letter and agrees that it is absolutely essential that the Olympic family promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs can be better served by moving forward with meaningful change to our organization than by having certification removed.
The USA Gymnastics Federation supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how abuse of such proportions as that so bravely described by survivor Larry Nassar could have gone undetected for so long, and welcomes necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal - to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.
Throughout the 1960s, Brzezinski worked as an advisor to John F. Kennedy and subsequently for Lyndon B. Johnson's administration.
During the 1976 elections, he was a foreign policy advisor for Carter, and later served as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, succeeding Henry Kissinger.
Like the NSA, he assisted Carter in the diplomatic handling of world affairs, such as the Camp David Accords in 1978; the normalization of relations between the US and China in the late 1970s; the Iranian Revolution, which led to the Iran hostage crisis in 1979; and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.

It not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils often cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The researchers say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on the upper side, with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Given that the dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, known as a rachis or quill, but do possess other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flying, but instead for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that the specimen shows adult plumage and not downy feathers, even though the tail comes from a young dinosaur.
The researchers argued that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not young down.
A car bomb that detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.

They found that the sun operated according to the same fundamental principles as other stars: The activity of all stars in the system was found to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
The star's Rossby number is determined using luminosity and rotation, which is related to plasma flows.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

He added that "they should not, however, be expected to take on obligations that go beyond their level of development, responsibility, and capabilities."
The Iraq Study Group presented its report at 12:00 PM today.
No one can guarantee that any action in Iraq at this point will stop sectarian warfare, increasing violence, or a slide towards chaos, it warns.
The report opens with a plea for open discussion and consensus in the US regarding Middle East policy.
The report is highly critical of almost every aspect of the executive branch's current policy towards Iraq and calls for an immediate change of direction.
The first of its 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of this year to secure Iraq's borders against hostile interventions and to re-establish diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

Irritation within the community led to the current efforts to develop a policy regarding sexual content for the website that hosts millions of openly licensed media.
The work performed was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the research team was looking for would be caused by forces resembling tides in the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts gravitational pull on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The researchers were able to determine that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo, and is made of many small particles.
Television broadcasts show white smoke coming from the facility.
The local authorities are urging residents in the area around the power plant to stay indoors, turn off their air conditioning, and not drink the tap water.

Doctor Tony Moll discovered the extensively drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming due to the very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have been infected with the bacteria at the hospital, according to Dr. Moll, at least two of whom were hospital staff.
During the year, an infected person can transmit the infection to between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, it seems that the proportion of XDR-TB within the entire group of people with tuberculosis is still low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

After the dam was built in 1963, the seasonal floods that spread sediment along the entire river were prevented.
This sediment was necessary to create sandbanks and beaches, which served as natural habitats for wildlife.
As a result, two fish species have become extinct and two others are endangered, including the humpback chub (Gila cypha).
Even if the water level rises only a few decimeters after the flood, officials hope it will be enough to restore the eroded sandbanks downstream.

Infrared images show that the temperature variations between night and day likely indicate that they are caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior isn't as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with these being deep holes in the ground," says Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) Astrogeology team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed paper slip with their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting document.
French electoral law codifies the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of the voting process and that no envelopes are added except those duly counted from eligible voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers under extensive supervision, and following specific procedures, count the votes.

Four skiers in the women's сидячие (sitting) group were unable to finish their runs, and 45 of the total 117 participating skiers in the giant slalom failed to place in the competition.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki announced that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Despite the fact that three people were in the house when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services cut the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to hospital at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been accused in Edinburgh Sheriff Court of murdering his son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but all eyewitness evidence may become worthless because her image has been widely published.
This is common elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law operates differently and courts have viewed publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are treading a dangerous line if they publish pictures etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, has told reporters that no further comments will be made before indictment.
According to the leak, the document concerns the border dispute, where the Palestinians want the borders to be based on those before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics said to be reported on include the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel is requesting a constant military presence for ten years in the valley after an agreement is signed, while the PA only approves of leaving such a presence for five years.
Hunters in the supplementary pest control trial would be closely monitored by the park rangers, as the trial was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Culture with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting assignment received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP) yesterday.
That is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in the space of four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former provisional electoral council as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The partly violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been overdue since 2011.
There have been reports of approximately 60 cases where defectively designed iPods have overheated, causing a total of six fires and inflicting minor burns on four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the units.
METI announced last week that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called "minor."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' emergency services office reported that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also announced that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later switched places with an elderly woman because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Wrestling colleagues also praised Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died on a night with two moons. Pretty unique, just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said in a comment that "Luna was as big a freak as I am... maybe even bigger... love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place now."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number who opposed Australia becoming a republic had grown by 8 percent since 2008.
During the campaign for the 2010 federal election, Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the participants in the survey share this view, that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle, as well as three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his ailment, there have been doubts about his fitness.
He has not been able to take the medications needed to overcome his pain because they are prohibited in the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery with different hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water resources on Earth, along with organic material that could form proteins and sustain life.
Because comets collided with Earth long ago, researchers hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political babble and nonsense."
There is speculation that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would mean that planes fly shorter distances, save millions of liters of fuel each year, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It utilizes satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no extra transport provided, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available at ground level.
The fear of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the match might have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University reported that the new species developed in just two generations, even though this process was believed to have taken much longer due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, *Geospiza fortis*, and the immigrant Española Darwin's finch, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small forms.
It can be drawn into thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The juice from the cabbage changes hue depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together. Then, form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman society, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women spent time together.
When you call someone hundreds of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space with the help of a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and field of vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 30 meters tall to get a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has brought about is to give us much simpler and faster methods of transportation.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including stray domestic cats) that consume a much larger quantity of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a specific job for each cat that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cat species, and live in large groups called prides.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males together with as many as thirty females and young.
The hens are often closely related to each other; a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lions act much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
As an all-around athlete, the tiger can climb (but not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is part of the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar isn't like the lion's loud roar, but more like a string of growled, screamed words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Researchers believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by scent, sniffing the ground where they have been.
They have excellent night vision and can move very stealthily in the dark. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then pouncing.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they often end up in a different environment than the one they were previously in.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different features or adaptations than it needed before.
The indigenous population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same accommodations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they start to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, exhale).
Plants produce food using sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants and make our clothes out of plants. Much of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain during its time, so it had nothing to fear except other mosasaurs.
The long jaws were lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the palate, meaning there was no chance of escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked anything that came down into the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Even though most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their fair share of strange or unusual delicacies, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they could recline on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained food that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
They did not have, for example, corn, nor tomatoes, cocoa, or potatoes, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods, which was considered to be the god's home.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to appease the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests had access to.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The tower's peak was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the Middle East's warm climate, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
Women cooked food in the courtyard; shops were just open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, therefore wood was very precious.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Nordic sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland as punishment for murder, and that when he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
Even though each country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Even if there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" were written. The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we know that the large parchment (measuring 75.6 cm x 62.2 cm) was rolled up for storage early in its existence.
So it's likely that the text was just written there as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who had come to an agreement with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which also in some way defines the size of society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge between multiple generations, a lingering cultural footprint, and an equitable distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with Congress as its sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked all power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it fell to the states' authorities, which were often uncooperative, to implement all of its decisions.
It also did not have the authority to repeal tax laws and customs duties between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all states before they could be added, and the states attached so little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the world's second most successful team and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island country in the world!
With its many islands, Japan is often geographically considered an archipelago.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiates a transformation of the indigenous grain production, employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty's (1644-1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
Following the defeat in 1895 in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which sovereignty over Taiwan was ceded to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the periphery of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still images in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the formats of photo sensors in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divide by twelve to achieve the simplest whole-number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, APS format) match this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a certain order in an image.
It is claimed that the best placement for the subject is where the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally meet (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had united European states despite their differences in language and customs.
Its ubiquitous power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of Christianity's main doctrines states that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources are for precisely that purpose.
The central power of the church had resided in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being upheld.
Shortly after the conflict broke out, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off essential military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law as codified in numerous international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent all ships from crossing entire areas of the sea, making it risky even for neutral vessels.
Having received a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most inhabitants and countries was pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, countries wanted to avoid such a situation from repeating itself in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States of America in 1884 to begin working at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different time periods; each stage in China's history, or each family that held power, was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable period where the provinces were divided. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms, which took place during the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, violent warfare often took place between many noblemen vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to sit in the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, a transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not a single ruler.
Furthermore, professions were opened up to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same applied to the military, where rank within the army was now based on calibre instead of class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to revolt.
Muhammad was deeply interested in subjects beyond his everyday life. He often used to visit a cave that became known as "Hira" on the "Noor" mountain (light) to contemplate.
The cave itself, having survived the passage of time, provides a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, which is located on one of the mountain peaks north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's actually not easy to find, even if you know it exists. Inside the cave, there is total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except for the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid of Giza is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tomb monuments, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Pyramid of Cheops was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-bow" marking looks like a V, and the "down-bow" marking like a bracket or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means that you should start at the tip and push the bow upwards, and down means that you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow downwards.
An up-bow typically generates a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more resolute.
You are welcome to add your own markings, but keep in mind that the printed stroke markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd that screamed and shouted threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows wide open.
On one occasion, one of the mob's participants swung the head of an imperial guard, who had been killed at Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses for the American imperialism's conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the cost and interest on bonds in the Philippine government's name through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the huge profits stemming from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental gains from American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to the order's creation.
The historical period in which these events took place is often called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history from the 11th to the 14th centuries.
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which formally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many different ideas in practice, ranging from the notion that technology drives development or the technological imperative, to the strict view that humanity's fate is driven by a fundamental logic connected to the laws of nature and how they are manifested in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially contingent.
For example, one could say that the motorized car inevitably leads to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically sustainable for only a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a strong element of determinism, originating with authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture arose related to this geography, and these, being in harmony with the location of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began to circulate around 400 AD and continued until approximately 1100 AD.
Its influence decreased during the 14th century mainly due to the fact that crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued higher than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was around this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 12th and 13th centuries.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow communication routes, styles in the west could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture carried out for the production of enough food to solely meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses saved seeds originating in the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by society and allow them to find their identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical in nature, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinct and symbolic style choice, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident, or intentional abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "feral". Some feral children have been locked away by people (most often their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the parents rejecting a child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Feral children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness entirely on their own.
When a feral child is raised entirely by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely identical to those of the specific nurturing animal, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, support teaching goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a support for individuals who are learning something new, for example, how to use a new computer program or how to start a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the little Clippy guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalized in the software and is intended to question, guide, and explain methods that may have been too challenging for the student to manage independently.
Children are placed in foster care for many different reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, or educational, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our family home system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster homes are meant to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the homes they came from.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The internet's distinct characteristics lead to further dimensions in terms of user theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Also, 'personal involvement' and 'ongoing relationships' were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites."
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial expressions that last only a few milliseconds.
It is particularly claimed that one can determine if a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his writing "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks showed how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even claims that we share such knowledge in interpreting human behavior with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research during the 20th century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations back and forth between the two poles for each new generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like a human's to satisfy its need for amino acids from the plants that are available.
Furthermore, the absence of this has serious consequences; stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In comparison, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also offers high-quality proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
When all is said and done, we shouldn't be too surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly thereafter (10–60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you closer to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you usually turn off the alarm in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep, which forces you to get up and pee.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded with the path of love within Mahayana and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini yoga awakens kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Deity yoga is central to Tibetan meditation. Through visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and enlightened awareness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the USA. When the war ended, the differences in system, process, and culture led to the collapse of cooperation between the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought physically by contract armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland and simultaneously violated the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
By far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans is to use ships to transport cargo.
Navies have traditionally had the job of ensuring that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously disrupting the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to move troops and materials across the Atlantic to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily with the use of submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Great Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes kept them for milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other grazing areas, often herded by shepherds who were often children or young people, similar to the more well-known shepherd. These herding methods are still used today.
Railways for wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though wagonways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to achieve higher speeds and haul larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Sleepers were introduced fairly early to hold the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had a layer of iron on top.
This became standard practice, but the iron wore down the wooden wheels of the carts more.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first rails made entirely of iron were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transportation was walking; humans began to walk upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning the upright man) saw the light of day.
Their predecessor, australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can get involved in the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases like symptomatic treatment. But if we don't just want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It appears with all desirable clarity that the world has changed greatly due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and the problems have been exacerbated due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read aloud to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 known surviving Dunlap broadsides are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The handwritten original has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still exist today. We call them birds.
Many don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like they did in dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary digits.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always immediately noticeable. Symptoms like vomiting are too general for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best sign of poisoning may be an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term beetles is used in a formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term originates from an ancient kinship with bedbugs, insects that are sharply adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the USA, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or in the best interest of their children, to raise a child.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
During an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method is guiding in almost all research.
However, it is not alone. Experimentation, where an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's view on all scientific matters, including psychology, was accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often largely due to the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not merely reactions to external periodic signals have been documented in most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustained oscillator that repeats its cycle over a period even in the absence of external influence.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the primary indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments that labeled either the DNA of the substance with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the substance with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be inherited by children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of experiencing the landscape, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is to visit, photograph, and learn more about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns in cars to go to their jobs and are passed by others whose destination for work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle, everyone is somehow linked to, and supports, a transportation system based on private car use.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has disturbed the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system. In principle, everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, one rarely hears similar complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave fairly consistently; thus, traffic tends to flow reasonably consistently and can be presented mathematically in broad terms.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These conditions are helpful in the planning, design, and operation of facilities along roads.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them more small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people believed he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the sun (and also the other stars).
This seems reasonable, since it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the world's most voluminous river and the second longest. Its water flow is more than 8 times greater than the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching 9 km wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the Earth's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main channel is 6,387 km long. It receives its water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and construction technique.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City has around 800 inhabitants. It is the world's smallest independent country and the country with the lowest number of inhabitants.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the government, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as these can be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything consisted of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he had theories about them changing into new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many different elements in the periodic table.
Substances like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a faithful companion for many people when it came out.
As newer writing methods have been developed, unfortunately the pencil has received lower status and fewer uses.
Today, people write messages on computer screens, and never need to be near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to create a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Roughly like rolling a heavy cart uphill. To split the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, and it doesn't take much for them to decay.
The Moon's surface is made up of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner there. This made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories revolve around figuring out what motivates people or what appeals to them.
The theories posit that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they become adults.
These theories look at what makes certain people want what they want and what in their environment causes them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former peers. At one end of the spectrum, the manager tries to remain "one of the gang."
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
When all is said and done, the leader is ultimately responsible for whether the team succeeds or fails.
This behavior often results in divisions between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams maintain the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members tend to act as a point of contact for the physical team.
They often have more say than conventional team members, as different time zones can affect when their team can meet, and this may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management group to which all members report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of starting to use organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively within an organization's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
Therefore, the process for an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to support organizations in achieving a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, therefore making the field of study narrower and much more precise.
The correlation between brain diseases and behavior supports researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, diseases, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technology allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we haven't seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models, which help us understand processes in our mind.
Even though AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that involves the behavior, learning, and intelligence of machines.
Research in AI is about getting machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and also the recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on offering solutions to real-world problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in economics, medicine, technology, and the military, and has been integrated into several home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of the teaching in every class. Often, the teacher wants to take the students to places where there are no buses.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a study trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state's capital; the website is redone every year, but previous versions remain online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, but the presence of readers generally improves this.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to write better to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The requirement to cater to readers' interests encourages students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"Appropriate use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet material, students can define their positions in relation to what others have written, as well as account for their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, offering a range of galleries and museums showcasing Canada's present and past.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and in the northern part is Muskoka's beautiful, untouched nature.
All this and more distinguishes Ontario with what outsiders consider to be the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent of its own when it comes to fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or belong to France, and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the areas, which had a major impact on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope, thereby discovering the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's good to also wear a ring (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they might consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow them, grab their arm, etc.
Be firm when you say no to men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city of Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of knick-knacks, but it's all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly in the central areas.
Goma is fairly safe, but if you plan to visit outside of Goma, you should investigate the conflict situation in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price for a short trip is around 500 Congolese francs.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, remote places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat from desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS program Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities in the country, with an atmosphere that is Arabic rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while its southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which harbors different wildlife.
It is one of the biggest attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Just like all other South African national parks, the park charges daily conservation and entrance fees.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, which either grants access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong territory its name and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The row of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a sparkling bar graph, amplified by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views in Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon's waterfront opposite.
The vast majority of buildings on Hong Kong Island are densely packed together on former seabed along the northern coast.
This is the place the British colonizers took over, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world and stretches 80 km into Bangladesh and the Indian interior from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been adopted onto UNESCO's World Heritage List. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps — they contain some of the last remaining stands of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is made up of wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axis deer in the area.
Buses depart from the district-shared bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
As buses between districts are often full, it is a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and reliable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 meters high, it is 378 meters long and has two walkways that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs stations are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group that inhabited present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was populated by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived as hunters, gatherers, and fishermen.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was born, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," as a result of the meeting between the Spanish conquerors and groups of the native indigenous population.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for the fact that its polo teams and players are among the best in the world.
The year's biggest tournament takes place in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets to polo matches, contact the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
GBP is generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley, it's often possible to pay with credit cards and USD.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the remote islands, but British and American currency may be received; contact the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer reads.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
However docile they may look, musk oxen, moose, red deer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, keep in mind that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or preparing food that smells and keep the campsite clean.
Samoa's capital is called Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of a notorious standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave port.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of High Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to Auckland's location between two harbors. The most popular beaches are divided into three areas.
North Shore's beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches where it's safe to swim, and most offer shade from pōhutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes well-visited family beaches with a good selection of shops located by the beach. Swimming is safe.
The premier local beer is "Number One", which isn't a complex beer, but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
The local drinking water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is unknown. A "short black" is "espresso", cappuccino has a pile of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate milk meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips are made to the reef year-round, and damage to the reef from any of these causes is rare.
Still, take the authorities' advice, obey all signs, and be very attentive to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 17°S. They can sometimes also be found at other times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
The saltwater crocodile's primary habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton, so they don't usually live in the open ocean.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind and an assurance that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodations, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even package tours combining flights and hotels.
They can also hold your booking for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain additional documents required for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, all changes and requests must go through the travel agency first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the overwhelming majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on-site, and most visitors see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to where things are happening, you need to arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the music performances on the main stage have ended, parts of the festival may continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of your cabin, as going through ice causes really horrible noises for those who are most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see terms and conditions).
Casinos usually do everything they can to get guests to spend as much time and money as possible. There are often no windows or clocks, and the exits are often difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and encourage them to stay on the premises.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages for free. But intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware that snow, ice, and sub-freezing temperatures may occur.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can't drive the same way as on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted year-round.
Safaris are perhaps the largest tourism industry in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari, in popular usage, refers to overland journeys to observe the magnificent African wildlife, particularly on the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars, and with standard equipment, it is possible to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk" or "hiking safari") consists of walking for either a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will take place between August 24th and September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies due to the coronavirus vary, but as of the end of March, most do not extend as far as July 2020, when the Olympic Games were supposed to have started.
Most tickets to the event are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket price around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to borrow, even if it's not in the room.
If an iron isn't available, or if you don't mind wearing un-ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be vigilant and don't let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling the water for one minute is sufficient, while others require several minutes.
Filters can vary in effectiveness, and if you are unsure, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from an established company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Contagious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people violently, are not usually classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods without tax or other surcharges in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated primeval forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, drive with caution: steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are common.
Posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in preceding and subsequent sections - typically 56-64 km/h (35-40 mph) - and adhering to them is even more important than usual.
Oddly enough, the cell phone coverage is much better here than along many other stretches, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those from their southern neighbor, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common, with apples baked into pastries year-round, and cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but powerful pastries, you can try what, depending on the region, is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In northern India and Pakistan's inland regions, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a collective term encompassing a vast variety of regional dishes spread throughout the country.
However, when used without a determiner, the term tends to refer to the food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now available throughout the archipelago, offers an array of simply spiced dishes, where the flavorings most used by the Javanese are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can pose a safety risk as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot is caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear boots with a heel and a smooth, relatively narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that ensure a stirrup detaches from the saddle if pulled backwards by a rider who falls off.
Cochamó Valley, Chile's premier climbing destination, is known as the Yosemite of South America, and features a number of large granite cliffs and walls.
The mountain peaks offer views that can take your breath away. Climbers from all corners of the world are constantly creating new routes among the countless rock faces.
Downhill skiing, which includes both skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports where you glide down a snow-covered landscape with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums," who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular area.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5,000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport has existed since at least the 1600s, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is related to but does not typically involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter of which is performed on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover a greater distance than when walking – but you will rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control on multiple occasions.
However, the Schengen area functions roughly like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without undergoing passport controls repeatedly.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a visa in each Schengen member state separately. This saves you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, with age limits potentially being lower in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, even if they are not as old as similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many with other professions.
However, historically not all Sami people have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived off fishing, hunting and the like, and used reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
Even though it is often used, especially among non-Romani people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Romani people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel restriction, your travel health insurance or cancellation protection may be affected.
You may also wish to consult governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different circumstances compared to Europeans or Arabs.
A travel advisory is just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The image presented is often hasty, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available from other sources.
Extreme weather is the general term for all dangerous weather phenomena with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they come in various forms, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, heavy precipitation, and wildfires are types and consequences of extreme weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include heavy blizzards, blizzards with drifting snow, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather affecting their area, as it may impact travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for "hostile environment training" will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course typically goes through all the topics mentioned here but in much more detail, often with practical exercises.
A course typically lasts between 2-5 days and includes role-playing, extensive first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are plenty of books about how to survive in the wilderness, while books dealing with war zones are rare.
Travelers planning gender affirmation surgery abroad must ensure they possess valid documentation for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without a specified gender (X) or documents that are updated to match a preferred name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become significantly more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender people who have not undergone surgery should not expect to be able to pass through the security X-ray screening with their integrity and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow from waves breaking on the shore, often near a reef or similar structure.
The underwater topography concentrates backflow into a few deeper areas, and strong currents leading to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion after trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, it's no more difficult than normal to swim back.
Try to aim for somewhere you won't get stuck again or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, wait to be rescued.
Reverse culture shock hits earlier than culture shock (there isn't as much of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their original culture.
Upon returning from living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The pyramids' sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually, you can always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The sound and light show is just like a fairytale book.
The backdrop is formed by the Sphinx, which tells a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries, and they have the highest number of bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Antarctic Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded crater of an active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Antarctic Peninsula and borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge with the plateau and then reappear to form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, which is divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, with a highest peak of 4,892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations with no mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally doesn't replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make calls.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that need remote data and voice communications.
Your local telecom operator should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
Traveling and learning are an increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year.
This is particularly popular among recent graduates, allowing them to take a year off before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can actually increase your chances of getting into higher education in your home country.
Typically, a fee is charged to register for these educational programs.
Finland is very boat-friendly. The land of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and archipelagos.
In the archipelago and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the archipelagos and the largest lakes are certainly big enough for any pleasure yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak can offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seventh or eighth person.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the specifically Baltic cruises include a longer stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend a couple of full days visiting the historical city while returning to and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only participate in shore excursions organized by the cruise ship, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises include the German capital Berlin in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people, regardless of age and background, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fear and aversion to other things that a great many people have.
Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome a fear that stems from discomfort with the unknown or from a lack of control.
Courier companies are well-paid for delivering things quickly. Often, time is very important when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, on some routes it may have taken several days to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. The airline's rules don't allow sending baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a whole lot of money for the privilege (or even better, have your company do it for you).
However, this doesn't come cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
Generally, it's pointless to even look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay well for the privilege of traveling somewhere quickly and comfortably. And the companies charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been affected by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any of the member states of the UN.
Economic relations have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite failures in political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The city, which was historically known as Smyrna, is today a modern, developed city and a vibrant commercial center located on a vast harbor surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping malls are mixed with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more akin to Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble statues of doves over some of the graves.
It's worth wandering around the captivating village for half an hour.
Within reach to the north lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after a glittering account of its grandeur by Lord Byron.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, also visit the fantastic Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place world-renowned for apparitions of Mary.
Remember that you are in fact visiting a mass grave and a place that has almost immeasurable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death here; Jews as well as non-Jews.
Use the website with the great dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by painting or scraping graffiti on structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, an overwhelming majority understand it, and virtually everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as it is the primary official language by law.
However, Spanish is also used in many places on public transport and in other institutions.
Regular announcements in the subway are only made in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even though this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to be on your best behavior and act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will make getting around significantly easier.
The Parisians' brusque exterior will quickly disappear if you show your polite side.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered in dense forest, mainly beech, spruce, and fir, and has a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably high biodiversity, due to the extent of microclimates, different soil types, and varying differences in altitude.
The area is also home to an extreme diversity of animal and bird species.
Rare animal species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be found there, along with many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear a skirt that covers the knees and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide shawls for women who haven't prepared in advance, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you'll receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
According to the same logic, men must wear trousers that cover their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the storage in the entrance, but these garments are not washed after each person, so you might not feel comfortable using these skirts. One size fits all applies to men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas around the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and optional available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as Sie for the pronoun ni (you), are capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
According to some, it even makes it easier to read, although the need to figure out whether a verb or adjective is in noun form makes writing slightly more complicated.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: "caro" means dear, while "carro" means wagon.
Persian has relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, you can get good help with learning a lot about Persian grammar and understanding sentences better if you read this grammar textbook.
It will naturally be easier for you to learn Portuguese if you already know a Romance language.
However, people who know some Spanish might quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution wasn't the kind of problem it is today during their heyday, they are usually found in cities or on university campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, or cherry blossom viewing, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were used.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the Emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look their best in their natural environment, so try to resist the temptation to remove "just one" specimen.
If you visit a landscaped garden, and you pick a "specimen," you will also be thrown out, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe and easy to navigate place, and you can buy almost anything you need after arrival.
But with its location in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is less often).
There are also a smaller number of buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives rest.
Make sure the bus you are considering taking goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great starting point for planning a vacation.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley or Rhine Valley, or take a boat trip to interesting cities on the Danube or a trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There's a tradition of spending Easter night awake at some open space to watch the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil service on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend. At midnight, the congregation then breaks up to celebrate the Resurrection of Christ.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by either swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not cross, and therefore the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived in the Galápagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is dark more or less around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners may be used to.
Suits are the normal business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, where the emphasis is placed on collective efforts rather than highlighting individual achievements.
Workers often need to get approval from their superiors for every decision they make and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
