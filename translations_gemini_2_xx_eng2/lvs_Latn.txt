In late 2017, Smirnoff appeared on the television shopping channel QVC.
The company "Ring" also resolved the dispute with the competing security company "ADT Corporation".
Although one experimental vaccine appears capable of reducing mortality from the Ebola virus, so far no drug has clearly proven to be able to cure an existing infection.
One antibody cocktail, "ZMapp," initially appeared to be a promising solution to the problem, but official studies showed that it had a lower impact on preventing mortality than expected.
In the PALM study, ZMapp was the control, meaning scientists used it as the baseline and compared three other therapies against it.
The USA Gymnastics Federation supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter and recognizes the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to foster a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's assertion that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sports, can be better served by moving forward with meaningful changes in our organization rather than decertification.
The US Gymnastics Federation supports an independent investigation that can uncover how the extent of Larry Nassar's abuse, so bravely described by the victims, could have gone undetected for so long, and encompasses all necessary and appropriate changes.
The U.S. Gymnastics Federation and the USOC share the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and equitable environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely circulated, but also provides information that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut-brown on top, but carotenoid-colored underneath.
This finding also provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed quill, called a calamus or rachis, but possessed other feather-like characteristics, namely barbs and barbules, researchers concluded that the quill most likely evolved later than these characteristics in the evolutionary development.
The feather structure suggests they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers pointed out that although this is a juvenile dinosaur tail, the sample shows adult bird plumage, not downy fuzz.
Researchers suggested that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult plumage, not baby fluff.

Stellar power and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

Public outrage has led to current efforts to draft a sexual content policy for a site hosting millions of openly licensed media.
The work done was mainly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter could cause the effect the team is looking for.
Just as the moon affects the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way affects the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made up of many small particles.

"Their thermal operating characteristics are not as stable as those of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but that's in line with them being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Science Center and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have never used much technology: voters go into a booth, place a printed sheet with their desired candidate in an envelope.
After officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting register.
French election law establishes a fairly strict procedure regarding the election process.
Since the 1988 elections, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent, so that voters and observers can verify that they do not contain any envelopes at the start of the election and that no envelopes are added other than those of duly registered and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe any part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following established procedures.

Edgars Vegilla sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristofers Šneiders required reconstructive facial surgery.
The weapon misfired when he aimed at the fifth man's head. Schneider has permanent pain, blindness in one eye, a missing part of his skull, and his face reconstructed from titanium.
Schneider testified via video link from a USAF base in his home country.
In addition to Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in two individual championship downhills.
In her first slalom race, she didn't finish the first run. The same result was achieved by 36 out of 116 competitors in this competition.
In other competitions, namely the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting downhill with a total run time of 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place winner, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place winner, Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female sit-skiers did not finish their runs in the downhill event, and 45 out of all 117 skiers were not ranked.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Aria said: "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman, and we have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kandžar, Bhuta Kandžar, Rampro Kandžar, Gaza Kandžar, and Vishnu Kandžar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused arrived at court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, she was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in custody at Edinburgh Sheriff Court in connection with the charge of murdering his son.
She is in custody awaiting the filing of charges and trial, but the eyewitness testimony may be inadmissible because her image has been widely publicized.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system operates differently, and courts have considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
University of Dundee professor Pamela Ferguson notes: "It seems that journalists are walking on thin ice by publishing photographs and other information of suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the point of indictment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute desired by Palestine, based on the border situation before the 1967 Middle East war.
As reported, topics such as the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley were also discussed.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, but the PI only agrees to such a presence for five years.
The foresters had to carefully guide the shooters participating in the supplementary pest control trial, as this trial was being monitored and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
Qualified volunteers were engaged through a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), and the SSAA Hunting Program.
According to information provided by Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks Conservation and Cultural Heritage with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation underwent comprehensive safety briefings and training.
Yesterday, Martelli swore in the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), which consists of nine members.
That is Martelis' fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the President's commission proposed an earlier resignation of the CEC as part of a package of measures designed to bring the country closer to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases have been registered regarding iPod malfunctions due to device overheating, resulting in a total of six fires in which four people sustained minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reports that it is aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "minor."
The ministry responded, calling the postponement of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 AM local time (Friday, 9:19 PM GMT).
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management has announced that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been released so far, but the deaths of at least six have been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, as well as Filipino photographers, were quickly released.
The photographers later took the older woman's place because she needed to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Ligins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
When he worked at the hospital, Ligins began to study premature births in his free time.
Her research suggests that after the hormone is administered, it accelerates the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua news agency reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two "black boxes" - flight data recorders.
Luna was also respected by other wrestlers who were her peers.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the original queen of hardcore. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night when there were two moons visible. Pretty unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Runnels, known as "Goldust," commented that "Luna was just as weird as me...maybe even weirder...love her and I'll miss her...I hope she's in a better place now."
Of the 1400 residents surveyed prior to the 2010 federal election, the number of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, then-Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
This view is held by 34% of survey respondents who want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
The conflicting results of the survey indicate that 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his preparation is being questioned due to his complaints.
He was not allowed to take medication to alleviate the pain because painkillers are prohibited in these games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematics and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
By the beginning of February, this discovery had been verified by several people using various hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets are precisely what brought water to Earth, along with organic substances that could form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed, as comet collisions with Earth occurred a long time ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo began his term as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
Assumptions are being made that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
"NextGen" is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, rather than older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to determine the location of pilots with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more precise information.
There are no plans to add extra transport, overground trains will not stop at Wembley Stadium, and car parks and "park and ride" facilities will not be available at this location.
Fears about the lack of transportation increased the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published in the journal "Science" on Thursday reported the formation of a new bird species in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that the new species arose in just two generations, even though it was thought that such a process would take much longer, given the interbreeding between the endemic medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis) and the immigrant large cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be cast into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled out into even very fine forms.
It can be drawn out like a thin wire, which can be bent and twisted. It can be forged or formed into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
That's called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) a chemical substance is.
pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together and then, with clean, damp hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, creating a strange sensation and forming a kind of coating.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in homes in the cities of Minoan Crete and on the island of Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women went together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
In space, a satellite receives a call and then almost immediately reflects it back.
A rocket sent satellites into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a massive rocket is needed, one whose height exceeds 100 feet.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is that it provides us with much easier and faster transportation.
It has given us trains, cars, and many other vehicles.
After that, there are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat a much wider variety of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a niche concept - a specific task that each cat performs, preventing them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
The herd consists of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to wolf or dog packs—the behavior of these two animals is surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not other big cats)—and are just as deadly to their prey.
The athletic tiger can climb (although not very well), swim, make long jumps, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's full-throated roar, but more like a growling, screamed sentence.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they have the opportunity, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals for food (prey) by scent, smelling the tracks they leave on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (for example, if they move across a mountain range or a river, or relocate to a new island so they cannot move back as easily), they will often end up in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and diverse competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be stronger competitors than they needed to be before.
The initial population hasn't changed at all; they still require the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as new residents begin to adapt to their new environment, they become increasingly dissimilar to the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important component of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, but absorb carbon dioxide, which people exhale.
Plants obtain their nutrients from the sun using photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
In its time, the mosasaur was the largest predator, so it was afraid of nothing except other mosasaurs.
In its long jaws were more than 70 very sharp teeth, complemented by additional teeth on the roof of its mouth, and therefore no one who crossed its path had any chance of escaping.
We don't know for sure, but it possibly had a forked tongue. Its diet consisted of turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that ended up in the water; even a huge dinosaur like T. rex couldn't handle it.
While most Roman food would be familiar to us, they also had some strange and unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and rodents called dormice.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate sitting in chairs, while wealthy men preferred to hold communal banquets where they reclined on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman dishes certainly did not use ingredients that were introduced to Europe from America or Asia only in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey meat.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's dwelling place.
People brought offerings to the gods, while priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs by organizing ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and, further in, an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, as part of a temple complex, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house was not so important.
The Jewish family mostly lived outdoors.
The women cooked food in the courtyard; the shops were simple open counters facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Ancient Scandinavian sagas tell that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, traveling further west, discovered a land he named Greenland.
However, despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each was a "Scandinavian" country, there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might believe a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are written the following words: "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text is visible upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that this large parchment document (29¾ x 24½ inches) was rolled up and stored shortly after its creation.
So the note is most likely just added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
It was governed by "Vichy France." These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France; this invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization is a specific culture formed by an exceptionally large group of people who live and work, cooperating with each other, that is, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means civil, related to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and it also somehow defines the size of a society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. The culture of a civilization means the transmission of knowledge to multiple generations, a lasting cultural impact, and its steady dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear, leaving behind no significant historical evidence, and are not recognized as fully-fledged civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states, based on the Articles of Confederation, first formed a weak central government whose sole component was the Congress.
The Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, and, as there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, which were often unwilling to cooperate, hoping that they would implement all the laws it passed.
He also did not have the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between countries.
For the clauses to be amended, unanimous consent of all states was required, but the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives often failed to appear.
The Italian national football team, as well as the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, having also won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, and Italians compete in both international and Olympic games.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), ranking Japan 7th in the world in terms of number of islands.
Thanks to the fact that Japan's territory includes several islands, from a geographical point of view it is often called an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginnings were in the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as "Ilha Formosa," meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of local indigenous grain-growing practices and employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan's incorporation into the Qing Empire as a province in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereign power over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings built on the periphery of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better understanding of how they were originally created.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the most common film size in the era of analog film.
It is still manufactured, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is now used in digital camera image sensor formats.
35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many commonly accepted formats (such as the APS format family) conform to these image aspect ratios or are very similar to them.
The much-maligned and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
It states that the most effective position for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and influential, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has united European countries, despite their different languages and traditions.
That all-encompassing power influenced absolutely everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the main Christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's funds are intended precisely for this purpose.
The central power of the Church in Rome has existed for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle is being upheld.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a blockade of the German fleet.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international laws codified in numerous international treaties of the last two centuries.
Great Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering a whole section of the ocean, endangering even neutral vessels.
Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the majority of residents and nations considered pacifism and isolationism to be the most important things.
After the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, countries wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous workplace) addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of depicting different periods of time; each stage of China's development or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Moreover, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a cruel struggle for the throne took place among many nobles.
The Three States period was one of the bloodiest eras in Ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying as they fought for the most important place in the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
Moreover, after the Revolution, all male candidates could apply for positions, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same applies to the military field, as military ranks were now awarded based on a person's qualities, rather than their belonging to a specific social class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in transcendental questions. He often went to a cave, which became known as the Hira cave on the Jabal al-Nour (Mountain of Light), to devote himself to contemplation.
The cave itself, having survived the upheavals of time, vividly demonstrates Muhammad's yearning for spirituality.
The cave is located on one of the mountain peaks north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find at all, even if someone knew it existed. Upon entering the cave, complete isolation sets in.
Nothing more than clear, beautiful skies overhead and many mountains all around is visible. From inside the cave, not much of the outside world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many massive pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," located in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, consists of several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
An upward arc looks like a V, and a "downward arc" looks like a bracket or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, down means you should start at the handle (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bow stroke usually produces a softer sound, while a down-bow stroke is stronger and more assertive.
You can mark your own notes, but remember that the printed markings are there for the sake of musicality and should usually be followed.
A frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, due to a mob of market women.
Surrounded by a crowd in a carriage, they headed back to Paris, with people shouting threats at the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, the gang member brandished the head of the royal guard, who had been killed in Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The costs of US imperialist war in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the expenses, and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government flowed through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super-profits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipino people formed the basic income of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the environment that prompted the order's creation.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages – a period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
Before the High Middle Ages there were the Early Middle Ages, and after the High Middle Ages came the Late Middle Ages, which ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that, in practice, encompasses a broad range of ideas, ranging from technology as a driving force or a technological imperative to a strict understanding that human destiny is driven by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism highlight two main ideas: that technological development itself occurs largely outside of cultural or political influence, and that technologies themselves create "impacts" on societies, and these impacts are consequential rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the automobile definitely contributes to the development of roads.
However, the state road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars, therefore, new production methods have been developed to reduce the costs associated with car use.
A large number of private cars also means a higher number of accidents, resulting in the invention of new methods in healthcare to repair bodily damage.
Romanticism was largely characterized by cultural determinism, which stemmed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography influenced people, and over time a culture and customs associated with the respective geographical region arose, which were better than arbitrarily imposed laws because they were in harmony with the place of society.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was also considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known as a center for luxury goods, starting around 400 AD and ending around 1100 AD.
Its status became less significant in the 12th century as crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than those available in Byzantine markets.
It was precisely at this time that Constantinople lost its title as the fashion capital, and Paris gained it.
Gothic style gained popularity in the 10th-11th centuries and later in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was largely influenced by the culture of the Byzantines living in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, fashion in the West can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest achievements of development at that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons for fastening clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is a type of farming that is carried out to grow enough food and meet only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses seeds collected within the ecoregion along with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, as still occurs in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ in terms of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Subculture members often emphasize their belonging through a distinct and symbolic style, including fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common techniques used to illustrate the importance of socialization is the use of unfortunate case examples of children who were not provided with socialization during their upbringing due to neglect, hardship, or deliberate malice by their parents.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child occurred because the parents rejected the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Feral children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
It is believed that some have been raised by animals; some say they have lived in the wild on their own.
Having grown up completely with animals, a feral child exhibits almost the same behavior (with physical limitations) as the animal that cares for them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning should make the training process easier and more interesting, and the scaffolding is a step forward.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support tool for people who are learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can happen both virtually and in reality, in other words, support can be a teacher, but just as easily a small paperclip character in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized in the software and are designed to ask, suggest, and explain procedures that a student might find difficult to solve alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even cases of extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving, and educational, yet it happens.
We believe that the foster family system is a safe haven for these children.
Our system, which provides for the fostering of children in families, must provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster families must provide everything that was lacking in the homes from which the children were previously removed.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct features of the internet create additional dimensions concerning the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are indicated as important motivating factors for internet use (James et al., 1995).
When studying the target audience's reaction to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivating aspects.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions - facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
It is particularly claimed that a person can determine if someone is lying by correctly interpreting facial microexpressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks showed how people who, due to brain damage, are unable to understand speech, are nevertheless able to accurately determine how truthful it is.
He even makes the assumption that such abilities to interpret human behavior may also exist in animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variations: cryptic and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, but selection removes it from the expressed variation pool.
Segregation and recombination shift the variation back and forth between these two sets in each generation.
Primates with a digestive system like humans find it difficult to obtain the necessary amino acids from the plant resources available in the savanna.
Moreover, it can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and even death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins, available in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they are difficult to digest unless cooked.
Animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs), on the other hand, is not only easily digestible but also provides a lot of protein containing essential amino acids.
Considering all of that, it would be no surprise if our ancestors also solved their "protein problem" similarly to how chimpanzees living in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is a process where a purposeful awakening is performed during normal sleep, followed by falling back asleep after a short period (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a relatively quiet alarm to keep you conscious but not fully awake.
If you tend to snooze your alarm, place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based trick is to drink a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before bed to force yourself to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive the existing life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing preventing us from reaching this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded with the Mahayana path of loving-kindness and numerous Indian yoga methods.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path to all-encompassing love.
During the practice of Kundalini yoga, Kundalini (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan meditation center is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war ended, these countries became hostile again due to differing systems, processes, and cultures.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was destined to last for the next 40 years and, using proxy armies, real warfare was conducted on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defenders had already been defeated, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became morally obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army arrived and established the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after having occupied the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships for transporting goods remains the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional task of a navy has been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while disrupting the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the World War II North Atlantic campaign. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, mainly using submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies hadn't succeeded, Germany would likely have conquered Great Britain just like all the other European countries.
Goats were most likely first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient peoples and tribes began to raise them because in this way it was easy to obtain milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the foothills and other grazing areas, and were looked after by goat herders, who were often children or adults, similar to the more widely known sheep herders. These grazing methods are still used to this day.
Wagons were already being built in England in the 16th century.
Even though the horse railway consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed draught horses to achieve greater speeds and pull larger loads than on the bumpy roads of that time.
Sleepers were used from the very beginning to keep the rails from moving. However, it was gradually realized that the rails would be even more effective if they had a metal strip on top.
It became a common practice, but the iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their australopithecine ancestors did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal individuals have already been found in the fossils of the genus Australopithecus, who lived 4.2–3.9 million years ago, although representatives of the genus Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and even be activists, in order to alleviate suffering in the future to some extent.
In many cases, it's like treating the symptoms. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and deactivate it.
It is clear that the world has changed significantly due to humanity's scientific and technological achievements, and problems have become more serious due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4th, the draft document, handwritten and signed by John Hancock, President of Congress, and Charles Thomson, Secretary, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, located a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides" (Declaration of Independence), were produced during the night.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and on July 9th, he read it to his troops in New York. One copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 "Dunlap broadsides" known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original, handwritten copy has not survived.
Nowadays, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many people don't perceive them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, birds still have many characteristics that resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus.
Almost all computers used today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or in computer language – bits.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately noticeable. Symptoms like vomiting are general enough that a diagnosis may not be made right away.
The most obvious sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of open medicine or toxic household chemical containers.
Read the first aid instructions on the label for the specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "beetle" for this group of insects in a formal sense.
This term originated from an ancient association with bed bugs, which are highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are parasitic pests that have adapted to living in nests or attached to other bodies.
In the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis have been registered, making it considered the most common neurological disease in young adults and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have revealed that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their own or their child's best interests.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their baby.
In the event of adoption, the biological parents' parental rights are terminated so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works by using the scientific method. In fact, this method is the driving force behind the majority of scientific research.
Experimentation also exists, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses. Questioning and observations can also drive scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's view was recognized in all matters of science, including psychology.
As fewer and fewer people knew Greek, the Western countries became separated from their Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The presence of endogenous cycles and their formation process, considering the biological clock, often has a decisive influence on many observed rhythms in psychology and behavior.
Periodic rhythms that are not simply a response to external periodic signals have been confirmed in most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to function freely even without external stimuli.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the leading pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, labeling either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected unit of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germline cell lineage can be passed on to children, but mutations in other cells can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
In these places you can enjoy activities such as hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, or you can visit parks and study information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting the island of Borneo to take photographs and get to know orangutans.
Every morning, people from small rural towns drive to their workplaces, while others arrive in their place, whose workplaces are located in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation bus, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transportation system that relies on private cars.
Scientists are now pointing out that an economy with such extensive carbon emissions has disrupted one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has underpinned human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and participates in transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear about similar complaints regarding water quality or crumbling bridges.
Why do such complaints arise about transportation systems, why do problems occur in them every day? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or is the root of the problem deeper?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their potential interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it's impossible to predict driver behavior with complete certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior most often has a fairly consistent range, which allows traffic flows to be assigned a certain consistency and roughly calculated mathematically.
To better reflect traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and processes of roadway infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily, as well as find food and mates more effectively.
The majority of insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, closely against their body along its entire length.
That gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many were of the opposite opinion: that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That seems reasonable, since there's no sensation of the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It contains more than 8 times the amount of water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, in some places six miles wide.
The Amazon contributes 20% of the total volume of water that flows into the oceans from all the world's rivers.
The Amazon River has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles). It gets its water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the very end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids, in terms of their size and the outstanding technical execution of their construction, remained unsurpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also an everyday language used by most people working in this country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican City residents are Roman Catholics.
People have known chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they are all found in nature in their free state and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle put forward the theory that everything consists of a mixture of one or more specific elements. These elements were earth, water, air, and fire.
It more closely resembled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many chemical elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There can also be alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Generally, everything is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that a single dot at the end of this sentence would consist of trillions of atoms.
Thus, when the pencil came into being, it was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the status of the pencil declined, and it began to be used less frequently.
Nowadays, people write messages on a computer screen, and there is no longer the slightest need for a pencil sharpener.
We can only imagine how the keyboard will change when some newer invention appears.
An atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is required to assemble an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
In a way, it's like rolling a heavy cart uphill. When the nucleus is split again, some of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to split with little provocation or simply spontaneously.
The Moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side, but 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the basalt plain and thicker under the highlands.
The near side might have more lunar maria because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory basically tries to clarify what inspires people or what attracts them.
These theories propose that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized upon reaching adulthood.
These theories explore what makes certain people want to do the things they do, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Usually, managers who start managing their former colleagues may exhibit two types of behavior. At one end of the spectrum is the effort to maintain the "one of us" status.
Leaders of this type have difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the leader becomes an unrecognizable individual who seems to think that they need to change absolutely everything the team has done so far and transform it into their own achievement.
Ultimately, the leader is fully responsible for the team's successes and failures.
Such behavior often creates discord between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as a communication point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones, which their local management might not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (page 109, Larson and LaFasto's book, published in 1989) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "Invisible Team" is a management team to which each participant reports. The "Invisible Team" sets standards for each participant.
Why would an organization want to invest time in such a time-consuming process of building a learning organization? One of the goals for implementing the concept of a learning organization in practice is innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively in the organization's functional departments, creativity and resourcefulness can be revealed.
As a result, the process in which an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can facilitate the creation of a new, innovative process to meet the client's needs.
Before an organization focuses on innovation, leaders must build a culture of innovation, as well as an organization that shares knowledge and fosters continuous learning.
Engel (2006) explains the continuity approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it more precise.
Scientists are supported in their research by the correlation between brain pathology and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes happening in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence is largely associated with science fiction, it is an extremely important field of computer science that explores the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of technology.
AI research enables machines to automate tasks requiring programmable actions.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer questions and make diagnoses, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice and face.
These things have become distinct industries focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and are also embedded in numerous home computer and video game software applications.
Educational excursions form a large part of the learning process. Often, a teacher would gladly take students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual learning excursions. Students, sitting with their classmates, can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art.
Sharing virtual field trips is a great way to discuss the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their field trip to the state capital, and every year this website is redesigned, but the previous versions are preserved online as a historical album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Although often at first, when students start blogging, they don't pay attention to grammar and spelling, the presence of readers usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical target audience, the blog author is starting to make an effort to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Moreover, writing blogs "makes students explore the world around them more broadly." The need to maintain reader interest motivates students to be resourceful and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a technique that promotes collaboration and encourages students to learn outside of school hours.
Appropriate use of blogs "can stimulate students to become more analytical and think critically. By actively using materials available online, students can define their position in the context of other people's written content, as well as express their point of view on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital city with numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, while in the north you can enjoy the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka, and much more.
All of that and much more gives Ontario what others consider to be the real Canada.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and in some places there are virtually uninhabited wildernesses.
For a population comparison that surprises many: the number of African Americans living in the USA is much larger than the entire population of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is undoubtedly the largest, and when it comes to wildlife, it's like a continent of its own.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent countries or are associated with France, and are also known as luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also introduced Islam to the region - on the Comoros Islands and Mayotte, this happened on a large scale.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route from Europe to India around the Cape of Good Hope.
In the north, this region borders the Sahel region, while in the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all women traveling say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also useful to produce a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to situations that they may perceive as harassment, and it is not uncommon for a woman to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Don't be afraid to reject men and turn down their attention (regardless of cultural differences or not, it's still not acceptable).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used it as a strategic port under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casablanca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar al-Baida, and Spanish merchants, who established trading bases there, gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
In the Medina's old town, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, ceramic dishes, leather goods, hookahs, and all sorts of trinkets, but it's all intended for tourists.
Goma is a popular tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located right on the eastern border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in its center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside of Goma should be reviewed to understand the current state of fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and is near some of the least expensive mountain gorilla tracking locations in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use "boda-boda" (motorcycle taxis). The typical (local) price for a short trip is around 500 Congolese francs.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor used to describe exotic, faraway lands.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it an attractive object for tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sand.
This was one of the main stops where Henry Louis Gates' PBS documentary "Africa's Great Civilizations" was filmed.
The city is in stark contrast to the other cities in the country, as it has more of an Arabic style than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the Mozambican border to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and is bordered to the south by the Crocodile River.
The park's area is 19,500 km², and it is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting various wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the most important of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, this park also has daily maintenance and entrance fees.
It might be advantageous to also purchase a "Wild Card," which provides entry to specific South African parks or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of Hong Kong and is considered by many tourists to be the main area.
The cityscape that makes up the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a glittering bar graph, clearly accentuated by the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, head away from the island to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along its northern coast.
This is a place that British colonizers took over as their own, and therefore, if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, stretching about 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangrove swamps, however; they include some of the last remaining stands of the magnificent jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The area of the Sundarbans is 3850 km², of which about one-third is covered by water/swamp areas.

Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those heading east and on the Jakarta/Bumthang routes, depart between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
As intercity buses are often overcrowded, it is recommended to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Ride-sharing taxis offer a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (150 Bhutanese Ngultrum) and Punakha (200 Bhutanese Ngultrum).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Both towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long, and it has two lanes that are 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully ready for operation in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control points are scheduled to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, lived in the Chaco region, subsisting on hunting, foraging, and fishing.
Paraguay, once known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," emerged in the 16th century as a result of the interaction between Spanish conquistadors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The year's biggest tournament takes place in December at the Las Canitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and matches also take place here several other times a year.
For information about tournaments and places to buy tickets for polo games, see the website of the "Asociacion Argentina de Polo".
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound sterling (GBP) at a value of one to one.
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the "FIC West Store".
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere on the islands, while Stanley often also accepts credit cards and US dollars.
On the more remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although UK and US currency might be; ask the owners in advance to find out which payment methods are accepted.
It's almost impossible to find Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer there is when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, the temperature usually exceeds +30 °C.
Winter can be deceptively damp: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but if there's wind and moisture at the same time, it feels colder than the thermometer reads.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild, and should not be fed or disturbed.
As instructed by park authorities, a minimum distance of 100 yards/meters must be maintained from bears and wolves, and a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
However docile they may appear, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and can also be dangerous, so it is best to keep your distance from them.
Also, remember that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s, and it has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the infamous site of the 1889 maritime standoff, when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships sank, except for the British cruise ship. Almost 200 Americans and Germans died.
In the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city center escalated into the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Thanks to Auckland's two harbours, there are many beaches. The most popular are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the northern province of Harbour) are washed by the Pacific Ocean, and they stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches where it's safe to swim, and most of them have shade provided by pōhutukawa trees.
Tamakidraiva beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops located on the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it's not a beer with a strong flavor, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines are more popular.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you're apprehensive, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of 'coffee with milk' is foreign. Black coffee is called 'espresso', cappuccino is made with a huge pile of whipped cream (not milk foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Reef trips are organized throughout the year, but injuries due to these reasons are rare on the reef.
However, heed the recommendations of the authorities, pay attention to all signs, and carefully observe safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April in the northern part of the city in 1770. Sometimes they can also be found at other times.
Sharks are found, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of people and usually swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not common ocean inhabitants; their primary distribution area is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind knowing they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although you have the option of booking other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel deals.
They can also hold a reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for the destination (e.g., a visa).
However, any changes or requests must first be sent to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the majority of attendees choose to live in tents, and most of them consider it an essential part of the festival experience.
If you want to be close to the epicenter of the events, you should arrive early to find a tent spot that is close to the music.
Don't forget: even if the music on the main stages has already stopped, there may be places at the festival where music will continue to be played until late at night.
Some festivals have dedicated camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic region in winter, check the location of ice fishing huts, as crossing the ice creates a rather terrible noise for those most affected by this activity.
St. Petersburg cruise ships allow time for city sightseeing. Cruise ship passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the regulations).
Casinos usually do everything possible to keep their visitors for as long as possible and to make them spend more money. Usually, casino premises have no windows or clocks, and sometimes it is difficult to find the exit.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offers to keep guests in good spirits and keep them indoors.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are offered at the expense of the institution. However, alcohol consumption impairs judgment, and every good player knows how important it is to maintain a clear mind.
Anyone planning to drive a vehicle in polar regions or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
There is little friction on icy and snowy roads, so you can't drive the same way as you would on clear asphalt.
During blizzards, so much snow can fall in a very short time, which can cause traffic jams.
Visibility may also be limited by falling snow, blizzard, condensation, or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, so traffic flows mostly without interruption throughout the year.
Safari trips are arguably the biggest tourist draw in Africa and the highlight adventure for many visitors.
The commonly used term "safari" refers to overland journeys to view the stunning wildlife of Africa, especially the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars closely, so the standard equipment will allow you to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and they can be seen better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "safari hike," or going "on foot") is a hike that can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having also hosted the Olympic Games in 1964.
If you had booked flights and a hotel for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have found yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus pandemic-related cancellation policies are not being extended past the end of March to July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost from ¥2500 to ¥130,000, with standard tickets costing approximately ¥7000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. In many hotels, you can request an ironing board and iron if they are not available in the room.
If an iron isn't available or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Make sure the fabric doesn't get too hot (as a result it could shrink or, in extreme situations, even burn).
There are various water purification methods, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is enough, but in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, so if in doubt, consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal parasites that are unfamiliar to them in their native regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause inflammation, or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers who go to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont presents some of the most challenging driving conditions, often extending through isolated rural terrain.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, be careful - they have steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The permitted speed limits are significantly lower than on the preceding and subsequent sections of road – usually 35–40 miles per hour (56–64 km/h) – and it is even more important to adhere to them strictly.
But strangely, the cell phone signal is much stronger here than in other sections of the road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German culinary products are quite enjoyable, and in Bavaria, they are very hearty and diverse, similar to the southern neighboring country, Austria.
Apple-filled fruitcakes are available throughout the year, while cherry and plum fillings also appear in the summer.
Many German pastries include almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Often, these popular cakes pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small, firm, and rich pastries, try what is known as Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made from meat or vegetables, with the addition of herbs and spices.
Curry can be both "dry" and "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in South India and some coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is frequently used.
Indonesian cuisine encompasses the wide diversity of regional cuisines throughout the country, offering a choice from 17,000 islands.
However, without further explanation, this term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a wide variety of simple, spicy dishes. The dominant flavors favored by Javanese people are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, hanging on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can raise safety concerns because the rider's legs can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but his foot gets caught in the stirrups, the rider can be dragged along the ground if the horse runs away. Several precautions should be taken to reduce this risk.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather attachments to fall off the saddle if the rider falls and pulls them backwards.
The Cochamó Valley is Chile's premier rock climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, featuring a wide variety of massive granite walls and cliffs.
The summits offer breathtaking views from their peaks. Climbers from all over the world are constantly forging new routes on its endless rock faces.
Alpine skiing sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding downhill over snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
For many enthusiasts (sometimes called "ski bums" in English), skiing is the primary purpose of travel, and they plan all their vacations around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers have been dated as far back as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport began at least in the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: this activity is also known as cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It's related, but doesn't always involve ski mountaineering or alpinism; in the latter case, these activities take place on steeper slopes, and stiffer skis and boots are required.
Think of a ski tour as being similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover greater distances than walking—however, you will very rarely achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and a prepared track.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean numerous visa applications and passport controls.
However, in this regard, the Schengen area functions similarly to a single country.
When in this territory, one can usually cross borders without repeated passport checks at border control points.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each of the Schengen member states separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax agencies define antiques as items that are over 100 years old.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age restriction in places like North America might be lower than in Europe.
Handicrafts could be called antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is essential for the Sami to secure their livelihoods, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for representatives of many other professions.
Although not all Sami were traditionally involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather subsisted on fishing, hunting, and similar activities, primarily using reindeer as working animals.
Nowadays, many Sami people work in modern professions. Tourism is a significant source of income in Lapland, the Sami-populated area.
Although the word "čigāns" is widely used, especially among people who are not of Roma ethnicity, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to travel advisories, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may want to listen to the advice of another country's government, but it is intended for the citizens of those respective countries.
As one example, Americans in the Middle East and Central Asia may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Guidebooks only provide a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions submitted are often superficial, general, and overly simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather conditions refer to any dangerous natural phenomena that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather conditions can strike any place in the world, and they can vary depending on geographical, topographical, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are types and consequences of destructive weather, similar to thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal natural phenomena include, for example, blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather risks affecting the area, as they may impact all travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered a war zone should receive professional training.
Entering "hostile environment training course" into an internet search engine will most likely find the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, and practical tasks must be completed.
The course usually lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, various types of training in first aid, and sometimes also in the use of weapons.
There are many diverse books and magazines about survival in extreme conditions, but there are very few publications about living in war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents for their return trip.
The government's desire to issue passports that do not indicate gender (X), or documents that are updated to match the desired name and gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents varies to the same extent.
Moreover, security screening at checkpoints has become much more intrusive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender people in the pre-operative period cannot rely on their privacy and dignity not being violated when undergoing scanner checks.
Rip currents are a backflow as waves move away from the beach, often near a reef or something similar.
Thanks to the underwater topography, backflow is concentrated in a few of the deepest segments, where a rapid downwelling current can develop.
In most cases, death is caused by exhaustion that results from trying to swim back against the current, as it can be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back isn't any harder than usual.
Try to go somewhere you won't get pulled in again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you can wait for rescuers to arrive.
Reverse culture shock sets in faster than culture shock (has a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more intense.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
Returning home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your homeland's cultural habits.
When you initially went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust in a new country.
People may not realize that travelers returning home also need patience and understanding.
The pyramids' sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in this area for children.
Before the show starts, you can view the pyramids in darkness and silence.
Usually, you can always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors here. The sound and light show is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is like the background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries have territorial claims to the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819 and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which is home to the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
There are also Livingston Island and Deception Island, the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano forming a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region located in the southern part of the peninsula and is washed by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula's mountains merge into a plateau, then reappear, forming the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided into two similar parts by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains in Antarctica - the Vinson Massif - its highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4892 m in altitude.
In remote locations with no mobile network coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible choice.
A satellite phone is not quite the same as a mobile phone, as it requires you to be outside and in a direct line of sight to the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that require remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider will be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
For those planning to take a gap year, the opportunity to travel and learn is becoming increasingly popular.
It is especially popular among school graduates, allowing them to use a year before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, applying for a gap year course in another country can even improve the chances of resuming higher education in your home country.
Usually, there will be tuition fees for enrolling in these educational programs.
Finland is a great place for boat trips. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, located in lakes or coastal archipelagos.
Yachts are not always necessary in archipelagos and lakes.
While coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are indeed large enough for navigation by any yacht, trips by smaller boats or even kayak allow for a completely different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland, as every seventh or eighth resident owns a boat.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand are comparable, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most distinct Baltic Sea cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that by returning and staying overnight on the ship, you can visit the historic city for a couple of days.
If you only go ashore for excursions from the ship, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruise ship brochures mention Berlin (Germany). As you can see on a map, the sea is nowhere near Berlin, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of any age and background, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There's no need to be ashamed of it: it's no different from personal fears and dislikes of other things that many people have.
For some, overcoming the fear that arises from ignorance and the inability to control, could be helped by understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight.
Courier services have high prices for fast delivery. Often, time is the decisive factor when sending business documents, goods, or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies had their own planes, but on other routes, as well as for smaller companies, it was necessary to face a problem.
If they had sent the goods by air, on some routes it would have taken several days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it sorted out faster was to send it as registered baggage. The airline's regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, so you'll need to get involved.
The most straightforward way to fly first class or business class is to pay a hefty sum for the privilege (or, even better, have your company pay for it).
However, it's not cheap: business class usually costs four times more than a regular economy class ticket, and first class even eleven times more!
It's essentially pointless to even look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of higher-class air passengers who are willing to pay extra for the opportunity to reach their destination faster and fly in comfort, so they charge a corresponding price.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is an ethnically diverse republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, as a result of this conflict, the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic was created in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but it is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the unsuccessful political negotiations between these two parts of Moldova, economic ties have been restored.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

Further north, also visit the Mother of God Sanctuary in Fatima (shrine), which is world-famous for the apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Don't forget that, in essence, you are visiting a mass grave and a place that means an unspeakable amount to a significant number of people around the world.
There are still many men and women alive – both Jews and people of other nationalities – who survived the time spent here, and many others who had relatives who were killed there or worked to death.
Treat this place with all due honor, gravity, and respect. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage this place by marking or scratching graffiti on its structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half of the population chooses to speak Catalan, most understand it, but practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is the first official language according to the legislation.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and elsewhere.
Normal announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but for unscheduled disruptions, an automated system announces in many different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even though this stereotype is often wrong, the best way to get along with Parisians is still to behave impeccably and act like a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) person. This will greatly facilitate your travels.
If you show some basic politeness, the Parisians' unfriendly exterior will quickly disappear.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is very wooded, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and has a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a wide variety of plant communities due to the diverse microclimates, soil types, and altitudes above sea level.
This area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
It is also home to rare fauna such as the Eurasian brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, as well as many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and also cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries, women who arrive unprepared are offered robes, but if you bring your own, especially in bright colours, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are also required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow one from the supplies at the entrance, but the clothing isn't washed after every user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing those skirts. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine (like that of similar Mediterranean regions) is based on bread, vegetables and meat, especially pork, and olive oil is used everywhere.
An easy-to-prepare and widely popular dinner dish, especially in summer, is pamboli. It is made from bread, olive oil, tomatoes, and other available additions, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word "Jūs" (Sie), meaning "You" (formal), are always written with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
That is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
This also makes reading easier, although writing is made more difficult by the need to ascertain whether the verb or adjective being used is being used in a substantivized form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Furthermore, pay attention to the different pronunciation of the letters r and rr: "caro" means expensive, while "carro" means chariot.
Persian has a relatively simple and regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar primer would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, Portuguese will be easier to learn.
However, nowadays people who know a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough and does not need to be learned separately.
Older observatories are usually outdated nowadays and are used as museums or places for learning.
Since light pollution wasn't as much of a problem during their flowering period as it is now, they were usually located in cities or places that are much more easily accessible than those built today.
Most modern telescopes intended for research are huge structures located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as 'hanami', has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the Japanese apricot was the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy in the imperial court.
Plants look their best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formal garden, collecting "samples" will also be a reason for you to be unceremoniously asked to leave.
Overall, Singapore is an extremely safe place, it is very easy to get around, and you can buy practically anything after you arrive.
However, being located "right in the tropics" only a couple of degrees of latitude north of the equator, you will have to endure both heat (always) and strong sun (if the sky is clear, which is less common).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron - the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure your intended bus goes to Hebron, and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good vacation theme.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to interesting places along the Danube, or take a boat trip on the Erie Canal.
They also mark routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many holiday traditions have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries, as well as by people around the world who are not Christian.
It is a tradition to spend Easter night awake in an open place to see the sunrise.
This tradition, of course, has Christian theological explanations, but it may also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Easter Sunday night, where the gathering, with the ringing of bells at midnight, often turns into a celebration to honor the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands got here by swimming, flying, or drifting on currents.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals could not get there, therefore the giant tortoise is the main herbivore in the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
Since these areas are not densely populated, and therefore light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to stargaze.
Japanese work culture is characterized by a greater degree of hierarchy and formality than is typical for Westerners.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or title.
Harmony in the workplace is very important, therefore group efforts are emphasized, rather than individual achievements being praised.
Employees often need the boss's approval for decision-making, and employees are expected to carry out the boss's instructions without question.
