Although one experimental vaccine appears to reduce deaths from Ebola, so far, there are no drugs clearly proven to be suitable for treating existing infections.
A single antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise, but formal studies indicated that its benefit is less than what's required to prevent death.
In a Palm trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the mission of the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the critical need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of the athletes and clubs, which belong to us, and their sport, can be better served by moving forward with meaningful change in our organization, rather than withdrawing recognition.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent inquiry that could shed light on how the abuse described courageously by the survivors of Larry Nassar might have gone undetected for so long, and supports any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic & Paralympic Committee share the same goal: to make gymnastics, and other sports, as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and enabling environment.

This doesn't just confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but it gives details that fossils generally can't provide, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's feathers were chestnut brown on top with paler or carotenoid-colored underparts.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers didn't have a well-developed rachis, called the rachis, but they did have other feather features - barbs and barbules - researchers concluded that the rachis was most likely a later, gradual development compared to these other features.
The feather structure indicates they weren't used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggest that even though this tail belongs to a small dinosaur, the specimen shows feathers of a large animal, not the feathers of a hatchling.
The researchers suggested that, despite it being the tail of a small dinosaur, the sample shows mature feathers and not downy feathers.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

They found that the sun operates on the same principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system turned out to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Lighting and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
The lower the Ro number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic flaring.

The work that was done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to stimulate observations made about the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for is caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way galaxy.
Just like the moon affects the Earth's tides, the Milky Way also exerts a strong influence on the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
Scientists were able to determine that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy exists around the galaxy in the form of a halo, and is composed of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new strain was "very worrying and disturbing due to the very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the infection in the hospital, Dr. Mou'l believes, and at least two were hospital healthcare workers.
In a single year, one infected person can infect 10 to 15 people close to them.
Even so, the proportion of XDR-TB in the entire group of people who have TB still seems low; 6,000 out of 330,000 people were infected at any given time in South Africa.

The government also promised many millions of doses of the encephalitis vaccine, which will help prepare health agencies for next year.
The vaccine plans that were supposed to be delivered to the most affected areas from the past for this year have been delayed due to lack of funds and poor prioritization related to other diseases.

It's colder than the surrounding surfaces during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior isn't stable like large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it's consistent with them being deep pits in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, traditional voting was a low-tech experience where voters would isolate themselves in a booth and drop a pre-printed paper indicating their preferred candidate into a blank envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law precisely codifies the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no ballots in place at the start of voting and that no ballots have been added other than those of the authorized voters who were properly sorted.
Candidates can send representatives on their behalf to witness every part of the electoral process. And at night, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Oka's weapon malfunctioned while he was pointing it at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffered from constant pain and blindness in one eye and lost part of his skull, and they rebuilt his face from titanium.
Chad Schneider appeared via video link from the US Air Force base in his hometown.
After Wednesday's event, Karpanedo competed in two races alone in the championship.
Her first race was the slalom, and she won the "Not Yet Finished" award in her first round. 36 out of 116 competitors achieved the same result in that race.
In another race, the Giant Slalom, I took tenth place in the women's sitting group with a combined running time of approximately 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place Austrian, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth-place finisher Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to finish their runs, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom race failed to finish in order in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and stole her mobile phone and laptop back."
They named the successes after Baba Kangar, Butoha Kangar, Rampro Kangar, Ghaza Kangar, and Vishnu Kangar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Despite the fact that there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were harmed.
Despite that, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was closed for a short period while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
They took him first to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, they transferred him to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
From that time on, Adekoya appeared in the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh on charges of killing her son.
She's detained pending charges and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be tainted because her image has been widely circulated.
It's a common practice in other places in the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts considered that publishing the photos was potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "a journalist appears to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos and so on of suspects."
The Royal Court, which is responsible for legal proceedings, stated to reporters that no further comment would be made at least until the indictment is issued.
The document, according to the leak, will point to the dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants based on the pre-Six-Day War borders of 1967.
According to reports, other topics covered included the future status of holy Jerusalem for both peoples and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a continuous military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years upon signing an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to allow this presence for five years.
In the supplementary pest control experiment, the shooters had to be closely supervised by forest rangers, and the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated there.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation received comprehensive safety briefings and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday in a new nine-member interim electoral council (CEP).
It is the fifth CEP test for Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the previous interim electoral council as part of a series of measures to move the country towards new elections.
And the committee recounted Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The violent protests started sometimes due to the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents to them, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded, describing Apple's delay of the report as "really unfortunate."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 AM local time (Friday 09:19 PM GMT).
The emergency management office in the Northern Mariana Islands reported that there were no damages to report in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there are no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage and hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with an M16 rifle.
We rescued a good number of the hostages, and the death of at least six has been confirmed so far.
We were able to free six hostages, including children and elderly people, as well as the Filipino photographers.
After that, the photographers took the place of an old woman because she needed to use the restroom. Then, they shot Mendoza.
LeGones followed in his father's footsteps and worked in the medical profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and gynecologist and began working at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working at the hospital, Legons began investigating premature births in his free time.
His research concluded that administering a certain hormone would accelerate the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders from the "black box" on Wednesday.
Luna's wrestling colleagues praised her a lot.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night of two moons. Completely unique just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, saying "Luna was scary like me... maybe even more... I loved her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the survey participants share this opinion, and they expect Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
The last thing you'd imagine is that 29 percent of those surveyed say that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
He was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle events, having the Olympic gold medal, and in three races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaint, his fitness became questionable.
He couldn't take the necessary medication to overcome his pain, so they were prevented from participating in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Many people verified the discovery using different devices and software by the beginning of February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source for delivering water to Earth, along with organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, when comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, who took office as governor earlier this year, signed a bill into law last month allowing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
They were expecting him to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration says will allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
You're using satellite-based technology instead of the old ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft more accurately and give pilots more precise information.
There's no additional public transportation running, and the trains won't stop above ground in Wembley, and parking lots and park-and-ride facilities aren't available on site.
The people's fear of limited transportation increased the possibility of forcing the match to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science discussed the formation of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved in only two generations, although it was believed that this process takes much longer, due to interbreeding between the native Darwin's finch and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
We can make different shapes from gold, and it can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can then be twisted and coiled. It can also be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhered to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on whether the chemical substance is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the dry ingredients together, then squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, and this will give you a strange feeling and form a sort of coating.
My city Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had an organized bathroom in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage networks were discovered in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also baths in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, baths were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space, then immediately reflects it back, right away.
They launched the satellite into space using a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and visibility.
This thing needs a giant rocket, taller than 100 feet, to put a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel provided is an easier and faster means of transportation.
She brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Underneath her are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to gazelles and deer.
Lastly, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that prey on more numerous small creatures like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of "makaneh," which is a specific role for each cat that prevents it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Harems consist of one to three adult males, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Women are usually close to each other because they're a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lions behave with pride much like wolf or dog packs, and the animals are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger, as a well-rounded athlete, is able to climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
Tigers are in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar isn't like the lion's roar in its full sound, but it resembles a phrase of chronic, screaming words.
I like that the ocelot eats small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that sloths track and find animals to eat (prey) by smelling and sniffing out their location on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on it.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they came from (like if they moved across a mountain range or river, or if they moved to a new island and then can't easily return), they will most likely find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new inhabitants will need different features or adjustments to be strong competitors, more than what they needed before.
The original inhabitants never changed, and they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new residents start to adapt to their new environment, they start to appear less and less like the remaining residents.
Ultimately, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear completely different and we won't be able to call them the same species.
We call this process diversification, which simply means the formation of new species. Diversification is an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. And they also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals wouldn't be able to survive.
The Mosasaurus was the strongest predator of its time, so it wasn't afraid of anything, except other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws are studded with more than 70 sharp teeth, in addition to another set in the roof of its mouth, and this means that there is no escape for anything in its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet consisted of turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs; it may have been a cannibal.
And also, it attacked everything that entered the water. Even the giant dinosaur like T. rex, there was nothing like it.
While most of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans have unusual or strange festive elements, which are wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
The second difference was that while the poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to hold feasts together and they would recline on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals did not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
Like, for example, they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a main temple that was considered the god's home.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to meet the gods' needs through celebrations and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, and then an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, they built special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a special place for the god.
With the warm climate of the Middle East, a house wasn't that important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life became outdoors.
The women used to cook in the courtyard; the shops were just open counters facing the street. And they used stone to build the houses.
There weren't big forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland settled a bit. In the Scandinavian sagas, they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland on charges of murder, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were living there at that time.
Despite all the countries being "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you'll think that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Even so, this isn't right. Despite there being something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text is located upside down under the document.
And at a time when no one knew exactly who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, the large manuscript document (measuring 29 inches x 24 inches) was wrapped for storage.
That's why, it's possible they simply added the encoding as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the French "Vichy" regime. These are the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France and called the invasion "Operation Dragoon the First".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces liberated southern France and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization is an individual culture shared among a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis," which means civil, and which is related to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and this also defines in a certain way the size of the community.
States or cities are the predecessors of nations. Civilizational culture is the transmission of knowledge across generations, leaving a lasting cultural imprint and ensuring fair dissemination.
Subcultures often disappear without leaving historical evidence related to them and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
Through revolutionary war, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress being its sole component - according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress didn't have the authority to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
Also, she doesn't have the authority to override tax and tariff laws between states.
The documents required unanimous consent from all states before being amended, and the states took the central government very lightly, to the point that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is considered the second most successful team in the world, and they were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, so Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan includes approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest island country in the world!
Due to the branching/cluster of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical perspective, as "one archipelago".
Taiwan's history can be traced back to the 15th century, when European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to transform indigenous grain production practices, employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) seized control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province subordinate to the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which they ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu contains three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
They rebuilt most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex to give tourists a better idea of how they were originally constructed.
When 1976 came, we recovered thirty percent of Machu Picchu, and the restoration process continues until today.
For example, the common photographic format among people for still photos in the world is 35mm, which was the prevalent film size at the end of the analog film era.
And to this day they still produce it, but more importantly, the aspect ratio was inherited by digital camera sensors.
The 35mm format is actually something that confuses people, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
That's why they say the aspect ratio for this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many well-known formats (the APS format group, for example) equal or closely approximate the aspect ratio we were talking about.
The rule of thirds that they misuse and usually mock is a simple guiding principle that creates dynamism and maintains some order in the picture.
The rule says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (look at this example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was subjected to scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has connected European countries to each other despite differences in language and customs.
Her overwhelming power affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the core Christian principles is that we must use wealth to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds exist primarily for this reason.
The central authority was affiliated with the Church in Rome for over a thousand years, and this thing, that the authority and the money were with them, raised questions for many about whether they truly adhered to this principle.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved successful, as it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this siege violated generally accepted international law as codified in numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, and this has caused danger even for neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar reaction to unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and countries were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the countries desired to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of displaying different time periods; each stage of China or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty, there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most famous period was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During those periods, there was a fierce war between many nobles who fought over the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying while sitting on the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political impacts, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from autocracy to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, after the revolution, professions were open to all young applicants, and this allowed the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
This same thing applies to the army because instead of army ranks being based on class, they now depend on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammad was very interested in matters that transcended worldly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (meaning light) to contemplate there.
The cave itself, which managed to endure until this time, gives a very vivid picture of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him.
The cave's location is on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Seriously speaking, he's not easy to find even if you know he exists. Because the moment you enter the cave, you become completely isolated.
You can't see anything other than the clear, beautiful sky above and a few surrounding mountains. You can see very little of this world from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, includes many pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), many small tombs, many temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
An "upward arc" looks like the letter V, and a "downward arc" looks like a radical symbol or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start from the frog (so that you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
Usually, the upper bow produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more assertive.
Don't hesitate to draw your own markings in pencil, but remember that the printed bend markings are there for a musical reason, so you need to respect them.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced on October 6, 1789, to return to Paris from Versailles due to a large group of market women.
In carriages, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by crowds of people shouting and chanting against the King and Queen.
A group of fans forced the king and queen to open their car windows completely.
And once, one of the crowd waved the head of one of the royal guards who was killed in Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid for the expenses of the American imperialist war in the invasion of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to bear a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds that were floated in the name of the Philippine government through banking houses in Wall Street.
And of course, the huge profits they're taking from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people will constitute key gains for American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to their creation.
The era in which these events took place is referred to as the High Middle Ages, which is a period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages came before the Early Middle Ages and after it the Late Middle Ages, which they agreed ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of practical ideas, from the impetus of technology or technological necessity to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic tied to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism generally share two ideas: that the development of technology itself takes a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that this technology, in turn, has "unitary effects" on embedded societies, rather than being socially conditioned.
Like, for example, someone might say that cars make it necessary for us to develop roads.
Even so, the national road network isn't economically viable for a small number of cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Shared car ownership increases the rate of road accidents, which leads to the creation of new technologies in the healthcare field to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, taken from books by figures like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography shaped individuals, and with time, customs and culture related to this geography arose, and these, in harmony with the community's place, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Her fame began as being a center for luxury at around 400 meters and continued to around 1100 meters.
Her status declined in the 12th century, mainly due to the Crusaders returning with gifts like silk and spices, which were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.
Around this time, the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th/11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the Levant.
Even so, due to the slowness of communication channels, trends in the West could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
As the late Middle Ages approached, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at that time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is the type of agriculture that's done to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, and is mostly organic, using native, preserved seeds from the ecological region, in addition to crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a distinct subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Subcultural members often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, behaviors, and argot.
One common way used to illustrate the importance of socialization is by relying on a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized with by adults during their development.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some children are confined by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of the child's significant mental or physical disability.
It's possible that feral children suffered from child abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
And they claim that the animals raised the others; they say some of them used to live in the wild on their own.
When raised by animals instead of humans, a feral child will exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) that closely resemble the behaviors of the animals they were raised with, such as fear of humans or indifference towards them.
While it's necessary for project-based learning to make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding goes even further than that.
Scaffolding isn't a method of learning, but rather a helpful tool that provides support for individuals going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, and in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, as is the little paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
We're incorporating Virtual Scaffolds into the program, which aims to pose questions and request them, and explain procedures that a student might find difficult to handle alone.
They place children in alternative care for many diverse reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child can grow up in an environment that doesn't care for them, doesn't raise them, and doesn't teach them, but that's what's happening to them.
We know that the nursery system is a safe zone for these children.
The foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, friendly caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Adoption care is supposed to provide all the necessities that the homes we took them from previously used to provide.
The internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet connect us to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to uses and gratification.
Such as, "learning" and "socialization" were suggested as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
They also added "personal participation" and "relationship continuation" as new motivations by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they conducted a study on audience reactions to websites.
Using video recording allowed us to discover important things in interpreting subtle expressions and facial movements that last for fractions of a second.
Specifically, they say that one can discover if a person is lying by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks demonstrated how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that animals like domesticated dogs might share abilities like these in explaining human behavior.
Twentieth-century research clarified that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
The mutation added new genetic diversity, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variation.
Crossover shuffles genetic differences back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
Out in the savanna, it's difficult for primates with a digestive system like humans to find their requirements of amino acids from the available plant resources.
Also, failure in something like this has bad consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most accessible plant-based resources are proteins that can be obtained from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide high-quantity proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
Taking everything into consideration, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the "primordial protein problem" to some extent in the same way chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep fragmentation is the act of deliberately waking yourself up during your regular sleep period and going back to sleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
We can do this easily using a relatively quiet alarm to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock while you're asleep, you might want to put it on the other side of the room, so it forces you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other bio-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of stress in their body and soul.
The less stress, the more the positive life force increases. Everyone has the ability to find peace and complete contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of that goal is stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism relies on the teachings of Buddha, but it has expanded through the Mahayana path of love and many forms of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chanting, and visualizations.
The Tibetan Meditation Center is Ilah Yoga. By visualizing different deities, you cleanse the energy channels, activate the chakras, and generate enlightened awareness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. With the end of the war, clashes of system, ideology, and culture led to the division of the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies have now become enemies, and the Cold War has begun.
It was supposed to last for 40 years and fight in a real way, through proxy armies, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan and Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had completely collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
Nevertheless, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers entered the Soviet Union and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is considered the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The navy's job has traditionally been to ensure your country's ability to transport its people and goods, while simultaneously obstructing your enemy's ability to transport their people and goods.
One of the new examples that we need to pay attention to was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, mainly using submarines, was trying to stop that movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany most likely would have been able to invade Britain like it did with the rest of Europe.
It's clear that goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally raised in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were frequently children or adolescents, similar to the grazing system known today. And these grazing methods are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England early in the 16th century.
Even though the carriages were just parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them, achieving greater speeds and hauling heavier loads than those that traversed the roughest roads of the day.
They introduced Crossties fairly early to fix the tracks in place. Gradually, however, they realized that the tracks would be more efficient if there was a piece of iron on top.
It has become a common practice, but the iron caused corrosion to the wooden wheels of the carts.
Ultimately, they replaced the wooden wheels with iron wheels, and in 1767, they built the first complete railway tracks.
The first known form of transportation was walking. Humans started walking upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning "upright man").
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, didn't usually walk upright.
We found bipedal hominin fossils in Australopithecus excavations dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years, even though Sahelanthropus may have walked upright as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is just like treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problems and we need to disable them.
It's clear enough that the world has changed a lot due to humanity's scientific and technological progress, and the problems have become bigger due to population growth and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent several blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
Overnight, they made approximately between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "Dunlop Borders."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in Independence Hall Plaza on July 8th.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlop newsletters that are still available are the oldest remaining copies of the document. The original handwritten version is missing.
Many paleontologists today say that one group of dinosaurs lived and is still alive today, and those are the birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are a lot of things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today rely on processing information encoded in the form of binary digits.
A binary digit can have only one value out of two values, meaning 0 or 1, and these digits are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer language.
The internal poisoning might not be severe. The symptoms, like vomiting, are general, so we can't make an immediate diagnosis.
We can consider the best indicator of internal poisoning to be the presence of an open container of medications or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label and pay attention to it for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in its formal sense to refer to a specific group of insects.
This term is derived from the old familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that have adapted greatly to parasitize humans.
Both Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs are gentle insects and are adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Across the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
The couple may decide that it's not in their best interest, or in the child's best interest, for them to raise him/her.
These couples might choose to set up an adoption plan for their children.
In the adoption process, the birth parents relinquish their parental rights so that other couples can raise the child.
The main goal of science is for us to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method teaches most people who work in scientific research.
But it's not just that, it's an experiment, and an experiment is a test we use to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations, which also guides scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all scientific matters, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Usually, many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior rely on the existence of internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
We have recorded the circadian rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that continue to cycle freely even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to inject their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to distinguish DNA in the bacteriophage using radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a diverse range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Mutations in germline cells can only be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of activities on the site include fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting gardens, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting orangutans in Borneo, photographing them, and learning about them.
Every morning, people leave the small towns in their cars to go to their workplaces and see others whose workplace is the place they just left.
With these dynamic, back-and-forth transportation options, everyone is somehow connected to and supported by a transportation system that relies on and favors private cars.
Science is saying now that this massive carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
You rarely hear in developed countries similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Do transportation engineers not understand? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, traffic flow studies are considered difficult because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with 100% accuracy.
Luckily, drivers generally behave in a predictable manner to a reasonable extent; therefore, traffic flow usually has a reasonable consistency and can be approximately represented by mathematical equations.
To better represent traffic flow, we established relationships between the three key properties: (1) Flow, (2) Density, and (3) Speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals that flew in the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings back along the length of their body.
This gives them a wide range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people thought the opposite; that the solar system moves around the Earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
This makes sense because you don't feel like the ground is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the amount of water carried by the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world; its width sometimes reaches six miles.
20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main stream is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite them continuing to build pyramids with stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids have never been surpassed in terms of size and artistic distinction in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians marveled at the New Kingdom period from the relics of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old at the time.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and has the smallest population.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is mostly used in religious celebrations.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as they can be discovered in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract using rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle posited that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This resembled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also assumed that it transformed into new materials to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered minerals. Of course, there are also minerals like silver and gold.
You can also obtain alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
And like this, the pencil was a good friend to many people when they invented it.
Unfortunately, when new ways of writing emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lesser status and fewer uses.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, without needing a pencil sharpener.
One can only ask themselves how the keyboard will adapt when something new comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to bind the nucleus with protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the nucleus again will release some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to decay with or without a little push.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust's thickness is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thin under Maria and thicker under the heights.
There might be more fire near this side because the crust is thin. It was easy for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people tag or like something.
These theories state that people have specific needs and/or desires that they become aware of as they grow into adulthood.
These theories investigate certain individuals, exploring what motivates them to want the things they do, and what environmental factors influenced them to do or not do certain things.
Two well-known theories for content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former peers. One extreme is trying to remain "one of the guys (or girls)."
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, conduct performance evaluations, assign responsibility, and hold people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, the person turns into someone unrecognizable and feels like they need to change everything the team was doing and make it their own.
After everything, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate, physical group.
They often enjoy greater autonomy than traditional team members, meaning their teams can meet according to different time zones that their local management might not understand.
The existence of an actual "invisible one-team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of the virtual team.
The "invisible" team is the management team that every member reports to. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization go through a lengthy process to establish an educational organization? One of the goals of applying organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively by the functional departments of any organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the way the organization works together to overcome an obstacle could lead us to a new, innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must create a culture of innovation in addition to shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method they use to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides tangible evidence for the theoretical approach to investigating cognition, thereby narrowing the scope of research and making it more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain cognitive functions.
The emergence of new technologies is allowing us to see and examine brain structures and processes in ways we've never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Despite the fact that artificial intelligence has strong connotations in science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science, and it deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
The research involves using AI to create machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, in addition to recognizing handwriting, voice, and faces.
It's become like these things are separate specializations, and which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
They are often using artificial intelligence systems currently in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and it's also integrated into many computer software applications and home video games.
School trips are a big part of any class. A lot of the time, the teacher likes to take her students to places where a bus trip isn't an option.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips. Students can see artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or enjoy fine art while sitting with their class.
Participating in a virtual field trip is a nice way to reflect on the trip and allows for an exchange of experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and they redesign the website every year, but they keep the old versions online to serve as a memory book.
It's possible that blogs also help improve students' writing. Often, students start their blogs with poor grammar and spelling, but having an audience generally changes that.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts striving to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to become smarter about the world around them." The need to feed the public's interest compels students to be intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend the scope of learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical; through effective response to internet materials, students can identify their position in the writings of others and also define their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and includes a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
In the far south, there are Niagara Falls, and the north is home to untapped natural beauty, like Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what the diaspora essentially considers quintessentially Canadian.
Vast areas in the north have low population density, and some are almost uninhabited.
Let's compare populations, because this will surprise many: the number of African Americans living in the United States is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and it's practically a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent countries, or are affiliated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
Just as the Arabs brought Islam to the region, Islam also took strong hold in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The area is bordered to the north by the coastal region, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
The woman: It's better for any female traveler to say she's married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's also helpful to wear a ring (not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences may lead to what they might consider harassment, and it's not uncommon for them to be followed or grabbed by the arm, and so on.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but they abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city and named it Dar al-Badia, and they called it Casablanca. Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
In all corners of the Old City, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, like tagines, pottery, leather products, shisha, and a whole range of gigsaw tools, but it's all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from Mount Nyiragongo's eruption destroyed Goma, burying most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, we need to investigate any visits outside of Goma to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also considered a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and one of the cheapest places to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The typical (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Because they couldn't reach it, "Timbuktu" started being used as a passageway to distant, foreign lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS series, "Africa's Great Civilizations."
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it's characterized by a more Arab character than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the Mozambique border to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms its southern boundary.
The park's area is 19,500 square kilometers and it is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each zone having different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered one of the most prominent national parks in South Africa (SANParks).
As we do with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily park entrance and conservation fees.
It might also be helpful to buy a Wild Card, which provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its name and is considered the main hub by many tourists.
The procession of buildings that forms the Hong Kong skyline resembles a plan or design like a shining ribbon, possibly visible through the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along its northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers made as their own special place. So, if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
We can say that the Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest belt in the world, extending for a distance of 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
They declared the Sundarbans as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests aren't just mangrove swamps — they contain some of the last remaining symbols of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 square kilometers, almost a third of which is covered by water/swamps.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and currently it holds approximately 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses leave the station between areas (across the river) throughout the day, although most of them, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since intercity buses are usually full, it's best to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by comfortable, durable, small Japanese Coaster buses.
Service taxis are considered a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (number 150) and Punakha (number 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
I am ascending the two towers to a height of 83 meters. They are 378 meters long and contain two walkways that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
And they've decided that this bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, once they finish with the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, they lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaicuru and Payagua, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was born, previously known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three hundred years.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year happens in December at the polo fields in Las Canitas.
You can also watch tournaments and smaller matches here at other times of the year.
To get news about polo tournaments and where to buy tickets, check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
You can withdraw money at the only bank in the Falkland Islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
They accept the British pound anywhere in the islands, and they also accept credit cards from Stanley and the American dollar often.
They might not accept credit cards on the remote islands, even though they take British and American currency; therefore, you need to ask the owners before you go to determine the accepted payment method.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer is there when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone. Therefore, in the summer months, temperatures are higher than 30 degrees Celsius.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer reads.
There aren't distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain stays roughly the same throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the zoo are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild, and it is forbidden to feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
Regardless of how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they didn't maintain a safe distance. These animals are big and wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition to that, you should know that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food that has a strong smell and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and its population is just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and was the formal capital of Samoa starting in 1959.
The port was the site of naval confrontations with a bad reputation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships sank, except for one British warship. Close to 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
In many beaches, due to Auckland's interference between two ports. The most popular are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and most offer shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family-friendly beaches, sometimes crowded, with a good selection of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One," and it's not a complex beer, but it's enjoyable and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There's a lot of French wine one can drink, but New Zealand and Australian wine might ship better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A short black is an "espresso", the cappuccino comes piled high with cream (not foam), and they serve tea without milk.
The hot chocolate is leveling up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices, despite their high price, are excellent.
There are many trips to the coral reefs throughout the six, and injuries resulting from any of these causes from the coral reefs are rare.
Even so, seek advice from the authorities, adhere to all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near the beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the year 1770. We can sometimes find them outside of these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind knowing they will have a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents usually have deals with specific hotels, although you can find bookings for other types of accommodation, like campsites, through a travel agent as well.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get other travel documents (like a visa).
Despite that, you need to review any modifications or requests through the travel agent first, not directly with the hotel.
Regarding some festivals, the vast majority of attendees at music festivals choose to camp on-site, and most attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to get in early to secure a campsite close to the music.
Remember this, even though the music in the main theaters might be over, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals include special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the Northern Baltic Sea in the winter, make sure of the cabin's location, because walking through the ice is a big hassle for the people most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to increase the time and money that the customer spends. Usually, there are no windows or clocks, and it's difficult to find an exit.
Usually, they have food, drinks, and special entertainment to keep visitors in a good mood and keep them in the building.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks for free. Even so, alcohol impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high-latitude areas or over mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there's very little friction, and you can't drive like you're on bare asphalt.
With snowstorms, enough snow can fall to get you stuck in a very short time.
Visibility may be limited due to falling snow, blowing snow, condensation, or ice on the car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are considered normal in many countries, and traffic usually continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari trips might be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important for many visitors.
The widely used term "safari trips" refers to overland travel to witness the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get very close to the cars, and the standard equipment will allow for good viewing.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "push and walk," "long-distance walking safaris," or going "on foot") consists of hiking for either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021, and some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two editions of the Summer Olympic Games, after having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies only extended until July 2020, which is when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels offer irons and ironing boards for borrowing, even if there isn't one in the room.
If an iron isn't available, or if you don't feel like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful with the fabric, don't let it get too hot (which could cause it to shrink or burn in extreme cases).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling the water for a minute is enough, while in other areas it requires several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying bottled water from a company with a well-known reputation.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar animal pests in areas outside their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in a worst-case scenario, cause allergies, spread poison, or transmit infection.
Contagious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully harm or kill people, are not usually described as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy items exempt from taxes and fees at specific locations.
Travelers heading to countries that impose high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont is considered the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway because it frequently passes through isolated forest terrain.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: most of the way is steep slopes, narrow passages, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the sections before and after - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is more important than anything else.
The strange thing is that the mobile service is much stronger here than in many other stretches of the road, like, for example, Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very delicious, and Bavarian pastries are very rich and diverse, like those found in its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are well-known; they cook apples with pastry throughout the year, and cherries and peaches appear in the summer.
Many German baked goods are also characterized by almonds, hazelnuts, and other types of nuts. Popular cakes are usually very well paired with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small, filled pastries, try looking for what's called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish that relies on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, the use of yogurt in curry is common; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the Indian subcontinent, the use of coconut milk is common.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a blanket term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if we use it without the jargon, the term tends to originally mean food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a range of simple dishes, and the dominant flavors favored by the Javanese are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle.
It provides more stability for the rider, but there might be safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's legs getting caught in it.
If a rider falls off a horse and their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away a long distance. To reduce these risks, some safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, the knights wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, almost tight sole.
After that, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leathers to come off the saddle if pulled backwards by a fallen rider.
Valle Cochamo - the premier climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of walls and large granite boulders.
The summits have breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes within its endless walls.
Snow sports on slopes, which include skiing and snowboarding, are well-known sports that involve gliding over snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is considered a major travel activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums," who plan entire vacations to ski in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The history of downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backcountry skiing and snowboarding: This activity is also called ski touring, cross-country skiing, or snowshoeing.
He's into it, but usually ski tours don't involve things like the Alps or mountaineering, because the latter is done on very steep terrain and requires more robust skis and boots.
Think of skiing as a route that's similar to hiking.
Under good conditions, you'll be able to cover larger distances by walking - but you'll rarely achieve speeds that allow you to traverse the country without a heavy backpack on prepared trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through different countries means having to go through visa applications and passport control many times.
And yet, the Schengen area is almost like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay within this area, generally you can cross the borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for visas for each individual Schengen member state separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There isn't a comprehensive definition for manufactured items that are considered antiques. Some tax agencies say that goods older than 100 years are antiques.
The definition includes geographical variations, meaning the age limit might be shorter in places like North America than it is in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as artifacts, even though they are smaller than mass-produced goods of the same kind.
Reindeer herding is considered an important source of income among the Sami people, and also the culture related to trade is important for many other professions.
Even from a traditional standpoint, despite this, not all Sami people were heavily involved in reindeer herding; they lived off fishing, hunting, and things like that, and most of them were from reindeer animals.
Many Sami people today work in new crafts. Tourism is an important source of income in Sapmi, the Sami region.
Despite its widespread use, especially among non-Romani people, the word "Gypsy" is generally considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Romani individuals.
If the country you're planning to visit becomes subject to travel advisories, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance could be affected.
And it's preferable that you refer to the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Consultations are just a brief summary of the political situation in one country.
Often, the opinions presented are fleeting, general, and greatly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Harsh weather can happen anywhere in the world, and in different forms, which can depend on geography, terrain, and weather conditions.
Strong winds, cold, heavy rain, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes.
It includes extreme regional and seasonal weather phenomena such as snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
We strongly advise travelers to be aware of any risks of severe weather phenomena affecting their area, as it may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
Perhaps an internet search for "hostile environment course" can provide the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the issues we discussed here in much greater detail, and this is usually through practical experience.
The duration of the course is usually 2 to 5 days and it includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that talk about wildlife survival are widespread, but publications that talk about war zones are scarce.
Travelers planning to undergo gender affirmation surgery abroad must ensure they possess valid documentation for their return journey.
Governments vary in their willingness to issue passports with an unspecified sex designation (X) or to update documents to match the preferred name and gender.
The desire of foreign governments to respect these documents varies widely.
Security checkpoint searches became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people should not be expected to go through scanners before surgery to preserve their privacy and dignity.
Tidal currents are the backwash from waves breaking on the shore, usually near coral reefs or something similar.
Due to the underwater topography, backflow concentrates in a few deeper sections, and a swift deep-water current might form there.
Most deaths happen as a result of the exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which is impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming backwards isn't harder than usual.
Try to target a place where they won't catch you again, or rely on your skills. And if you've been spotted, you might need to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock hits sooner than culture shock itself (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more intense.
Sometimes, travelers who easily adapt to a new culture face particular difficulty in re-adapting to their original culture.
When you return to your homeland after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When I first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
People might not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning to their home countries.
The pyramid sound and light show is considered one of the most exciting things in the area for kids.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can appreciate them in silence before the show starts.
Usually there's always the sound of tourists and vendors. The sound and light show is like a book.
They chose the Sphinx as a backdrop and narrator for a long story.
They're projecting the scenes onto the pyramids, and the different pyramids are lighting up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by multiple countries and have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active ones in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among other places, there's Livingston Island, and Deception Island, which is flooded caldera of a still-active volcano and has given us a stunning natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region located south of the Peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge with the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth Mountains range, which is 360 km long, and through which the Minnesota Glacier flows.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains of Antarctica, Vinson Massif, whose peak reaches approximately 4,892 meters at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations with no cell service, a satellite phone might be your only option.
Generally, a satellite phone isn't considered a replacement for a mobile phone, because you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a phone call.
They use the service frequently via satellite, including pleasure boats, and also exploration trips that require remote data and voice.
Your local phone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
The most popular option for people planning a long annual vacation is travel and learning.
This thing is especially popular among school leavers, allowing them to spend a year before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a year-long training course abroad can improve your chances of transitioning to higher education again in your country.
There will usually be tuition fees for enrolling in these educational programs.
Finland is a great place for boats. It's known as "The Land of a Thousand Lakes" and also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
In the archipelago and the lakes, you don't need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are big enough for any yacht, small boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, and a boat can fit about seven or eight people.
This is the same in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but in a different form that is completely unique (like in the Netherlands, for example, the number goes from one to forty-one).
Most Baltic cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historical city for two full days, including the return trip and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you go to the beach using cruise excursions only, you won't need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some of the cruise trips show Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you saw on the map above, Berlin doesn't have a location close to the sea, and visiting the city is not included in the price of the trip.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't traveled before or have experienced a traumatic incident.
It's nothing to be ashamed of; it's no different from personal fears and disliking other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how planes work and what happens during a flight helps in overcoming the fear that is based on the unknown or on a lack of control.
They pay well to express delivery companies to deliver things quickly. A lot of the time, timing is very important with work documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
In some ways, large companies own their private planes, but there was a problem for other routes and smaller companies.
If you sell the items via air freight, the process will probably take a few days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow sending baggage without a passenger, which will be coming to you.
The obvious way to travel first class or business class is to pay a hefty sum to get the privilege (or better yet, have your company do it for you).
Anyway, this isn't cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay about four times the regular economy fare for business class, and 11 times for first class!
Generally speaking, it's useless to look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that there's a core group of travelers who are willing to pay significant amounts for the privilege of accessing a quick and comfortable location, and they pay fees for this.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is more widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the Pridnestrian Moldavian Republic (Transnistria), which unilaterally declared independence in eastern Moldova, and which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any United Nations member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have returned despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million people. It is also the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transportation hub.
It used to be the ancient city of Smyrna, and now it's a modern, developed, and busy commercial center, located around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, new shopping centers with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, ancient mosques and churches are spreading, although the city's atmosphere is more European Mediterranean than traditionally Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are marble sculptures that draw attention, with doves perched slightly above the tombs.
Wandering around the charming village is worth half an hour.
To the north and easily accessible lies the romantic and magnificent city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after a glowing depiction of its splendor was recorded by Lord Byron.
I regularly take the Scotturb bus 403 to Sintra, and it stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also, to the north, visit the Great Shrine of Sayyida Fatima, a place of Marian apparitions known throughout the world.
Please remember to visit the mass grave site, in addition to a site of meaning that is almost immeasurable for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived from that time, and many others who have loved ones who were killed or kept working until they died, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat the website with all the dignity, respect, and reverence it deserves. Do not tell jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site by putting marks or scratching writing on the walls of the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of them prefer to speak in Catalan, the majority of them understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
Even so, most of the signs are in Catalan only because it's mandated by law as the primary official language.
Despite that, they also use Spanish widely on public transportation and other facilities.
They only announce the regular announcements on the subway in Catalan, but they announce unplanned disruptions via an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being selfish, rude, and arrogant.
While this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to behave in Paris is to be on your best behavior and act like a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) person. It will make things much easier.
The sudden, outlandish designs of the Parisians will quickly evaporate if you offer some basic compliments.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has many forests, mainly with beech, resinous, and fir trees, and is characterized by a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a large and diverse collection of plant communities, due to the range of microclimates, different soils, and varying elevation levels.
The area is also considered home to a very diverse range of animals and birds.
You might find rare animals like the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the capercaillie, alongside many common species.
When visiting monasteries, they ask women to wear skirts that cover the knees and to cover their shoulders as well.
Most monasteries provide coverings for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it's brightly colored, you'll likely get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, they ask men to wear pants that cover their knees.
You can also borrow it from the storage at the entrance, but these clothes aren't washed after every user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing them. One size fits all for men!
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of similar regions in the Mediterranean, relies on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and they use olive oil in everything.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Ba'amb'ooli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes and any available spices, like cheese, tuna, etc.
You always capitalize all nouns, using "Sie" for "you", even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and things.
We can also say that it makes reading easier, even though writing is complicated because we need to know if the verb or adjective are used contextually.
Pronunciation in Italian is easy because they pronounce most words the way they are written, with liaison.
The main letters we need to pay attention to are C and G, because their pronunciation changes based on the vowel that follows them.
Also, make sure to pronounce the single 'r' and the double 'rr' differently: "caro" means dear, but "carro" means cart/carriage.
The Persian language is characterized by grammatical rules that are relatively easy and mostly regular.
That's why reading this introductory grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
And without even saying, if you know a Romance language, it will be easy for you to learn Portuguese.
Even so, some people who know a little Spanish might conclude that Portuguese is very similar and doesn't need to be studied separately.
Usually, pre-modern observatories are outdated today, and remain as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution wasn't at its peak like it is today, so they were usually in cities and universities, and it's easier to reach them than those who built them in the new era.
Most new research telescopes are large facilities in remote areas with suitable weather conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms, known as Hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept came from China, and plum blossoms were the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewings were hosted by the Emperor along with other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants thrive when they're in their natural environment, so try to refrain from picking any plants, even just "one".
If you're visiting a formally arranged garden, taking even "one single sample" will also lead to your expulsion, without discussion.
Singapore is generally considered a very safe place and easy to get around, and you can buy anything you need after you arrive.
But being in a "high tropical zone" a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to deal with the constant heat and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is less common).
There are also a few buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure the bus you're planning to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland waterways could be a nice place to spend a vacation around.
For example, visiting the castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, taking a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube River, or canoeing along the Erie Canal.
They also designate well-known hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays, and they celebrate the birth of Christ in it.
Also, many of the traditions associated with the holiday have been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
It's a tradition for them to spend Easter vigil awake in some open areas to watch the sunrise.
Certainly! Here's the English translation of the provided South Levantine Arabic sentence: "For sure there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could be pre-Christian rituals for spring and fertility."
Traditional churches often hold the Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter holiday, and worshipers often come to the midnight service to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally reached the islands arrived here either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, leaving the giant tortoise as the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the North Pole or the South Pole regions in the winter, you'll experience the polar night, meaning that the sun won't rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, because the sky will be more or less dark around the clock.
Because the areas have few inhabitants, and that's why light pollution isn't considered a problem most of the time, you'll also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are the normal work clothes, and coworkers address each other by their family names or job titles.
Teamwork in the workplace is very important, because it emphasizes collective effort instead of praising individual achievements.
Workers often need to get approval from their superiors for any decisions they make, and they are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
