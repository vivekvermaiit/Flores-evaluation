This not only proves that some dinosaurs had feathers, furthering a theory, but it also provides details that fossils usually cannot, such as color or three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the fur of this animal is reddish-brown like chestnuts on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored belly.
Their discovery also provides insight into feather development in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers were not well-developed with a central shaft, called a rachis, but possessed other feather-like features — barbs and barbules — researchers suggested that the shafts may have been a later evolutionary development as these indicate.
The feather structure suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggest that even though it is a juvenile dinosaur's tail, the feather sample shows that of an adult and not of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, even though this is a juvenile dinosaur tail, the model shows an adult female rather than a chick's bottom.
A car bomb exploded in front of the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.

Most of the work done was speculative, but a program was written to simulate the observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the group is looking for is the one that causes the gravitational forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls on the Earth, causing the tides of the sea, so too does the Milky Way pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have managed to determine that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as regular matter.
This theory states that much of the dark matter surrounding the galaxy is located around the galaxy like a halo, and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extremely Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, she said that her class was "terrifying and worrisome due to the very high number of students she fails."
Dr. Moll suspects that some patients may have been infected with the bacteria in the hospital, and the same thing happened to two or more hospital workers.
Within a year, a person with the illness can infect 10 to 15 other people.

These are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"The unstable nature of lava tubes, compared to the large caves on Earth which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, is due to them being shallower holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is usually a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put a printed ballot indicating their choice in an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and then signs the list of voters.

Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be shown to the voters and observers to ensure there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and also that no envelopes are added except for the envelopes of voters who have been counted and authorized.
Candidates may send representatives to observe all parts of the process. In the evening, volunteers will count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

In another event, the Giant Slalom, she finished tenth in the standing women's group with a combined running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes longer than the first-place winner Claudia Loesch from Austria and 1:09.02 minutes longer than the ninth-place winner Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers in the group who were able to ski did not finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom did not rank in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested the five men who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused were identified as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened remains temporarily closed while emergency services assist the driver of the red Audi TT.
She was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of her child.
He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any witness evidence may be tainted due to the widespread publication of his image.
This is common practice in the UK, but Scottish law operates differently, and the courts view the release of images as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee wrote that "journalists are like walking a dangerous line when they publish images, for example, of assumptions."
The Crown Office, which is primarily responsible for prosecutions, has told reporters that no further comment can be made until a charge is brought.
The document, according to a leaked report, concerns the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 Mideast War borders.
Other topics of discussion included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to all nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a continued military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA is only agreeing to allow that military presence for five years.
The guns used in the field trials for enhanced pest control are closely monitored by the rangers, as the trials are monitored and their effectiveness is used.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are called upon through the Association's Sporting Shooters Hunting Program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive instruction for safety and training.
Martelly swore in the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of efforts to allow the nation to move forward for new elections.
The commission is Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The fierce, one-time protests are due to the failure to hold elections, some of which are from as far back as 2011.
Fewer than 60 cases of iPod overheating and fires have been reported, leading to six fires and four people suffering burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said they are aware of 27 accidents related to clothing.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company considered "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in the report "truly disappointing."
An earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 in the morning local time (9:19 PM GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas management office said that there were no reported damages to the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many of those trapped were rescued, and less than six have been confirmed dead.
Six of those who were captured, including children, women, and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers soon took the place of an old woman because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature birth in his spare time.
Research suggests that during labor, hormones are released that can accelerate lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua said that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Luna's fellow wrestlers also gave her an award.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the second month. She was different. A strong woman."
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels said that “Luna was a comedian just like me… maybe even more so… I love her and I miss her… I hope she is in a better place.”
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, opposition to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that she believes Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
34 percent of those polled share the opinion that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
The latest reciprocal poll showed that 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic quickly, while 31 percent believe Australia should not become a republic.
The one who won the gold medal in the Olympics swam in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but due to his/her complaints, they doubted his/her health.
He was unable to take the medicine he needed to endure the pain because it is prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people have confirmed the discovery by using various hardware and software in early February and announced it on Tuesday.
The marshes may be the origin of the birth of water in the world together with the organic matter that can form protein and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth in the past.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political gossip and jokes."
It is speculated that he/she will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says allows aircraft to fly on closer routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel per year and reducing carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint the exact location of aircraft and provide pilots with accurate information.
There will be no extra transportation put on and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking at the venue and the park-and-ride facility will not be available at the venue.
Concerns about the lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the game will have to be played indoors without team supporters.
In a study published Thursday in the journal Science, the formation of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador was reported.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new classes changed in two generations, but this process is believed to be longer, due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into various forms. It can be made into small shapes.
It can be drawn into fine thread, which can be spun and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into thin sheets.
It can be made extremely thin and adhered to another metal. It can be made so thin that sometimes, it can be used to embellish hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is what is known as pH in chemistry. You can make an indicator using red cabbage extract.
The color of cabbage indicator changes depending on how much acidic or basic (alkaline) chemical is present.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost an electron (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and, using clean, wet hands, squeeze them to form a ball.
That ingredient mixes with the outer layers, creating a pleasant sensation and forming a shell-like texture.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets, which were connected to a well-developed sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in Minoan houses in the cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women socialized together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives your call and immediately relays it back to Earth.
A satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and images.
A giant rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The great things the wheel has done for us have given us easy and fast transportation.
Because of that, trains, cars, and many more kinds of transportation were created.
There are many smaller cat species compared to those that prey on smaller animals like rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Eventually, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats) that prey on a wide range of small animals such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is the concept of niche, a special job that cats hold onto and don't allow others to compete with them for it.
Lions are the most social of all the cats, and they live in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three related males, and up to thirty females and cubs.
Usually, it's the women who are close relatives, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave much like wolf or dog packs, creatures surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and are equally dangerous to their prey.
The tiger is a skilled player, able to climb (but not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's growl is not like the full-bodied roar of a lion, but it's like a sentence with a wild, proclaimed narrative.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, turtles, and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals that ocelots catch are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by smelling, sniffing where they are on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark due to their night vision, and they can move stealthily. Ocelots hunt for their food by stalking around their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
If a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originated (such as if they moved across a mountain range or river, or moved to a new island so they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than where they remained before.
This new environment possesses varied resources and diverse competitions, so the new population needs a variety of qualities or adaptations to become more competitive than what it needed before.
Even though its original population hasn't changed, they still need the same familiarization as before.
Over time, as populations began to settle into their new environments, they started to look different from other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will become so different in appearance that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that people release (that is exhaled).
Plants create their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. If there were no plants, animals would not live.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of smaller animals during its time, so it had no fear, except for other Mosasauruses.
Its elongated snout is armed with 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set on the roof of its mouth, meaning it doesn't back down from anything it encounters.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacks anything that goes into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex is helpless to fight it.
While most of what they ate is familiar to us, the Romans had some surprising or unusual things at feasts, including wild boar, peacock, turtle dove, and a type of mouse they called dormouse.
One difference is that even though these poor people and that woman were eating what they had while sitting on chairs, the rich men wanted to have a banquet with a dance floor by the shore while they ate.
The cuisine of ancient Rome likely did not include foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and the ancient Romans never tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built temples for their gods, which they called the house of god.
People bring their sacrifices to the gods, and the priests also try to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests can enter.
Sometimes, towers formed as unique pyramids, called ziggurats, were made as part of temples.
A unique sanctuary for the god is on top of the tower.
Due to the hot climate of the Middle East, the house is not very cool.
Most of the lives of Hebrew families took place in the open air.
The women are cooking in front of their houses; the stalls are just tables set up on the sidewalks. Stone was used to build the houses.
There is no great abundance in the land of Canaan, so wood is very expensive.
Greenland is not very habitable. In Norse sagas, they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he sailed westward, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Even without its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Even though each country is "Scandinavian," there are many differences in the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Even if there's something written on the back of the document, this is not a map for treasure.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The writing appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
No one truly knows who wrote these, it was discovered that in its early life, the large parchment document (measuring 29 ¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, they can add a simple notation, just like a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
The "Vichy" French were defeated. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the conquerors instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion that was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces liberated southern France and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization is a culture refined by a major group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and it is also what gives meaning to the size of a society.
City-states were the first to be established, eventually becoming nations. The culture of a civilization highlights the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and equitable distribution.
Minority cultures are often lost without leaving behind valuable historical evidence and are not recognized as full civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government—only Congress was part of it—under the Articles of Confederation.
The power of the Congress to impose taxes is insufficient, and, because there is no national executive or judiciary, they depend on government authorities, who are often uncooperative, to enforce all their laws.
He does not have the authority to change the tax and tariff laws between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states largely disregarded the central government, so they often had no representation.
The Italian national football team, as well as the German national football team, are the second most successful teams in the world and were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are popular in the Northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island country in the world!
Because the islands of Japan are located close together in groups, the geography of Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago."
Taiwan's history began in the 15th century when passing European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a shift in aboriginal crop production and employing Chinese laborers to work for rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) occupied the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu contains three primary structures, called the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings along the complex have been renovated to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration is still ongoing today.
For example, the common film format for photography worldwide is 35mm, which was the most used film size before the analog film era ended.
It is still being developed up to now, but the main thing is, the aspect ratio was inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Actually, the 35mm format is misleading; it's actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The ratio of this form (each measurement is divided by 12 to get the smallest whole number) can be expressed as 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) are similar or closely related to this aspect ratio.
The constantly abused and often scorned rule of thirds is a simple guide to creating dynamism while maintaining a sense of order in an image.
This means that the most effective spot for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the photo into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has unified the states of Europe despite having differences in language and lifestyle.
During his extensive reign, he affected everyone from the king to the common citizen.
One of the core Christian teachings is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are specifically intended for that reason.
The center of the church's authority has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and because it is the center of power and money, many doubt whether its teachings are still being followed.
Not long after, when the war broke out, Britain began their blockade of Germany's shipping.
The method of removing essential military and civilian supplies has been proven effective, but this blockade violates fundamental, accepted international law as provided for in several treaties over the last two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering that entire section of the sea, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Because there was a limited response to these tactics, Germany expected a similar response for unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the main tendency of most people and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrific and violent events during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his first job) for Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there were different ways of indicating the passage of time; each region of China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
And between each dynasty was a turbulent period of provincial division. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period which occurred within 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, a fierce war has occurred with many rulers fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, where thousands of people died fighting just to sit in the highest position in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation is the body of the people, not just a single leader.
Even after the Revolution, workplaces opened up to all male applicants, allowing those with burning ambition and talent to succeed.
The military is the same way because instead of basing a soldier's rank on their class, they now base it on the caliber [of weapon].
It sparked the French Revolution and inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other nations to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a deep interest in things beyond ordinary life. He would often go to a cave known as "Hira" in the Mount of "Noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which still exists today, provides clear evidence that Muhammad was interested in spiritual matters.
Perched on the summit of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave was isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's hard to find even if we know it exists. If you're inside the cave, you're always alone.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramids are one of the many massive pyramid structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead of Egypt, has several pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The large pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were also built to honor Khufu's wife and family members.
The "up bow" mark looks like a V and the "down bow" looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom edge.
The uphill means you start at the tip and push the arrow, and the downhill means you start at the frog (which is your hand holding the arrow) then pull the arrow.
The up-bow usually produces a weaker sound, but the down-bow is stronger and firmer.
Don't hesitate to write your own lyrics, but remember that a copyrighted work has a reason for its music, so it needs to be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a group of market women forced the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
In the carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and expressing fear against the King and Queen.
The rioting crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage.
On one occasion, a member of the unruly mob raised the head of the royal guard who had been murdered at Versailles in front of the horrified Queen.
The Filipino people themselves ultimately paid for the expenses of the U.S. imperialist war in their conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial government of the United States to cover the majority of the expenses and the interest on bonds used in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos constitute the main form of U.S. Imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context of why the formation of this organization was triggered.
The period in which those events occurred is commonly called the High Middle Ages, a period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended in 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a vast number of ideas currently in use, such as the creation of a product due to technology or the use of technology for the common good, and the strict notion that the fate of people is directed by an unseen logic connected to the laws of science and what technology dictates.
The most common interpretation of technological determinism offers two ideas: that the development of technology follows a path beyond the influence of culture or politics, and that technology has an "effect" on traditional societies, but within societies already shaped by it.
For example, one might argue that the motor car necessitates the improvement of roads.
For example, the existence of a wide road throughout the country would be a waste if there were only a few vehicles, so new ways of manufacturing vehicles were developed to make the price of buying a vehicle more affordable.
The prevalence of cars leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, resulting in the development of new healthcare techniques to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism has a large element of cultural determination, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individual people, and over time, actions and culture associated with that geography emerge, and these have a connection to the place of society, and are better than abstractly applied laws.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople can be called the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its prominence as a center of prosperous living began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined in the twelfth century because the Crusades truly brought back items like silk and spices that were more expensive than Byzantine goods.
This era marked the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was promoted during the period between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
In the olden days, clothes were heavy and heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to long communication, the styles inside are late by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest advances of that era as a result of the crusades was that people began to use buttons to close clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is practiced to produce just enough food for the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, mostly organic, system that uses saved seeds native to the region and is supplemented with techniques like crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase yield.
According to history, many farmers made a living through agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel left out of society and allow them to create a sense of belonging.
Subcultures are identified by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture can be language, appearance, religion, political affiliation, sexuality, geographical location, or a combination of these.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through recognizable and symbolic use of style, including fashionable clothing, behavior, and language.
One common way to illustrate the importance of attachment is by considering the rare failure cases of children who, due to neglect, tragedy, or abuse, were not attached to an adult while growing up.
Those children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children were confined by people (often their parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the child is due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Children who are isolated from people may have experienced severe abuse or difficult circumstances before being abandoned or running away.
It is believed that some were raised by animals; they say that some lived alone in the wilderness.
If a non-human animal raises a child, the feral child will exhibit behaviors (with some physical limitations) similar to those of the animals that cared for them, such as their fear or discrimination against other people.
Whereas the project's foundation for learning is to simplify and make learning more interesting, the scaffolding system is still better.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather a tool that provides support to individuals learning new experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual or actual; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is that little paperclip person in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are embedded in the software and designed to question, guide, and explain concepts that might be difficult for students on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not helped, cared for, and taught, but it is unavoidable.
We realize that the Foster Care System is a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, secure education, and reliable healthcare.
It is hoped that Foster Care will provide all the needs they didn't have in their previous home.
The internet has brought together the element of mass reach and interaction.
The defining characteristic of the Internet results in an added dimension regarding its uses and how satisfying it is.
For example, "learning" and "social interaction" have been suggested as important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal interaction" and "ongoing relationship" are identified as new aspects of encouragement, according to Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated viewers' reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that can occur in just milliseconds.
A key belief is that you can tell if someone is lying by accurately interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, indicated how a person can fail to understand speech due to brain damage and not realize the fact that it is correct.
She even said that these abilities to understand people's character might also be possessed by animals such as pet dogs.
20th-century research revealed that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and visible.
Mutation adds genetic variation, and selection removes it based on fitness.
Selection and mating restore and direct the reorganization of differences between the two gene pools in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to obtain its required amino acids from available plant resources.
Furthermore, not doing that will have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and death.
Proteins found in leaves and seeds may be the easiest plant resources to obtain, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
The difference is that animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides a high amount of protein with all the necessary amino acids.
If we look at everything, we shouldn't be surprised that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a way similar to what monkeys in the savanna do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of forcing arousal during normal sleep time and returning to sleep briefly (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This is easily done with a very gentle alarm clock that restores your awareness but doesn't actually wake you up.
If you need to set your alarm for when you sleep, it can be placed on the opposite side of your room, forcing you to get out of bed when you turn it off.
Another option based on biorhythm includes drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known to be diuretic) before sleeping, which leads a person to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
When tension is lower, the more positive the life force that exists. Everyone has the potential to find complete peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but expanded the path of Mahayana compassion and through many techniques from Indian Yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantra, and visualization.
The Yoga of the deities is central to Tibetan meditation. Through visualization of the various deities, energy pathways are purified, chakras are released, and mental clarity is generated.
Germany was an enemy of everyone during World War II, which resulted in the alliance of the USSR and the USA. When the war ended, the systems, processes, and cultures were no longer in agreement, so the countries began to compete with each other.
Two years after the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
This lasted for forty years and was a real struggle, with proxy armies and battlefields stretching from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and various other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had collapsed, and their only hope was to retreat and regroup at a bridgehead in Romania.
However, these plans became useless almost overnight, when nearly 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the Belarussian and Ukraine fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thereby violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the ocean.
The work of the navy is usually to ensure that the country resides in its ability to transport people and goods, while concerning the ability of the coast guard to transport its people and goods.
One of the most interesting examples of this in recent times is the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, using only U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies hadn't succeeded, Germany might have defeated Britain because it already had control of most of Europe.
Goats may have been first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising them to have an easy source of milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Goats are commonly raised as herds and allowed to roam in the hills and other grazing areas, often led by children or young people, similar to how shepherds tend sheep, which is more familiar to many. This method of goat herding is still practiced today.
Wagonways were developed early in England during the 16th century.
Even though the railway tracks were made only of wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve speed and haul larger loads, even when traversing rough roads during the day.
The crossties were delivered early in order to lay the tracks. But, later on, it was decided that it would be better to have iron on top of them.
This has become a common practice, but the iron caused the wooden axles of the carts to rot even more.
Later, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first mode of transportation was by walking, people started walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
The early ones among them, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as a habit.
The unique ability to walk upright on two legs has been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, even though Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live in harmony with the environment, we can mimic the environment's movements, and we can be activists to better prevent future suffering.
It seems like this is a band-aid solution. But if we don't want a temporary solution, then we should go and look at the root of the problems, and we should remove them.
It is clear that the world has changed because of the scientific and technological advancements of people, and the problems have worsened due to overpopulation and the expensive cost of living.
Following the Congress's approval on June 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the nearby printing shop of John Dunlap.
Around 150 to 200 copies were made overnight, now called "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things that birds have in common with dinosaurs.
There are sakada that have scales and roots, they lay eggs, and they walk using two hind limbs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information written in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have two values, which are 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits, when used in computer parlance.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately felt. The symptoms, such as vomiting, may vary, so immediate diagnosis may not be made.
The primary sign of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medicine or poisonous chemicals used in the house.
Check the label for proper first aid application for the indicated poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal way for these groups of insects.
This term originated from the ancient knowledge of Kiteb, insects that easily become parasites to humans.
Both ants and termites live in colonies, accustomed to living in their nests or residing in their habitats.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has revealed that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
The couple can decide that raising the child is not in their best interest, or if it's in the best interest of their child.
These parents can make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents' rights as parents are terminated so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works by using the scientific method. This method underpins most scientific research.
But not only that, experimentation also, a test of an experiment that can be used to eliminate one or more possible assumptions, questioning, and observation also leads to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's ideas about all things related to science, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline in knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many observable rhythms in physiology and behavior are often critically dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their propagation by a biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just simple responses to external signals, have been documented for most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks maintain their own oscillators that continue to function for a period of time even without external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the most famous demonstrations that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used a microbe, or virus, to inject their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments that labeled the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germ-line cells.
Only germline cell mutations can be passed on to offspring, but mutations in other areas can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the sights, including plants and animals.
Examples of activities in the area include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and learning information about the ecosystem.
Examples include visiting, taking pictures, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people from small towns commute to their workplaces and meet people whose workplaces are only in the place where they came from.
In this dynamic transportation landscape where everyone seems connected and relies on a transportation system based on private vehicles.
The science now tells us that the vast carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from its stable state that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone in the community uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In wealthier countries, you rarely hear the same complaints about water quality or bridges falling apart.
Why are transportation systems making such a fuss, why can't they just fail every day? Are transportation engineers useless? Or are there more important things?
Traffic engineering is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Even so, studying traffic patterns is difficult because of driver behavior, which is certainly not 100% predictable.
Advantageously, drivers adhere to a lawful and consistent range; thus, there is also a flow of traffic in a lawful consistency and can be described mathematically.
To show a better arrangement of vehicles, relationships were established between the three main differences: (1) order, (2) quantity, and (3) speed.
These relationships can help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first to fly. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators faster and effectively find food and mates.
Most insects benefit from their ability to fold their wings back neatly against their bodies.
This gives them a wider space to hide from potential predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are termites and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed otherwise; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, along with the Sun (and other stars).
It seems real, doesn't it, because we don't feel the Earth moving?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It has more than eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching up to six miles wide in its widest sections.
A whole 20 percent of the water discharged from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's center is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from various smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction using stone continued until the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and excellent craftsmanship.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of those who came before them, which were already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Italian is the language used by Vatican City for legislation and their official communications.
Italian is the everyday language used by most workers, while Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about important chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as these are found in the environment and are easy to mine even with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that all things are formed by the combination of one or more of the four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
It's like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, even though it is assumed that they will change to become a new substance in order for what we will see to be formed.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many metals on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys can also contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was considered a friend by the people.
Sadly, with the emergence of new writing methods, the pencil is not used as much anymore.
People nowadays only write using computers and they barely even touch a pen anymore.
No one can tell what will happen to the keyboard when a newcomer arrives.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to create a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart uphill. The re-splitting of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning their components are loosely bound and can separate even with little or no movement.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon's surface is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the rice paddies and thicker under the highlands.
There might be more maria near the edge because the land is thinner there. It's easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on exploring what motivates people or what they desire.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that they get accustomed to during their lifetime.
These theories explore the purpose that causes people to like the things they like and what things in their environment cause them to do or not do things.
Two of the most famous theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In a typical conversation, both qualities can arise when managers prioritize their former peers. One point of concern is the attempt to be "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager struggles to make complex decisions, discipline, evaluate performance, delegate responsibility, and hold their people accountable.
At one end of the spectrum, there is someone who is changing to an unknown individual who feels they need to change everything the group has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is truly responsible for the success or failure of the group.
This behavior often results from disagreements between leaders and other members of the group.
Artificial groups have similar standards to natural groups, but they also have subtle differences.
The members of the virtual group serve as a talking point for their main physical group.
They are often more independent than regular group members because their groups can meet according to the different time zones where they are located, which the local manager may not understand.
The presence of a real "unseen team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a distinct aspect of virtual teams.
The "unseen group" within the organization mandates that each member reports. The unseen group sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One purpose of implementing organizational learning concepts is change.
If all resources are used effectively throughout a department in an organization, creativity and wisdom will remain.
As a result, the organization's process is collaborative in order to overcome obstacles and can result in a new and improved process to better provide the real needs of customers.
Before an organization can change, leaders must create a culture of change, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains that the Appreciative Inquiry Continuum is a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of operation.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, thus narrowing the scope of inquiry and making it more precise.
The correlation between pathology and brain function supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors can affect character and lead to changes in other patterns of thinking.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides a lot of information and materials to create a simulation model that can help us understand the processes in our minds.
Even though AI is largely associated with science fiction, AI is a crucial branch of computer science that studies methods of instilling behavior, learning, and skills into a machine.
AI research includes developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent qualities.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions for real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and it has also become integrated into many home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any school. Teachers always love to take their students to places that buses can't reach.
Technology provides solutions such as virtual field trips. Students can see artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or view beautiful art while seated with their class.
Participating in a virtual field trip is also a great way to remember field trips and share experiences for the next class.
For example, each year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capitol, each year that website changes, but the old versions remain online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. As you try to write a blog, even if there are mistakes in grammar and spelling, you will gradually improve it as others read or see it.
Because students are often the readers, the blog writer therefore does everything to make the writing substantial and well-written, and to avoid being criticized.
Blogging "encourages students to be knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to feed the interest of the audience motivates students to be informed and interested.
Blogging is a tool for collaboration, and it encourages students to focus on learning even outside of school.
The correct use of blogs "can empower students to become critical and analytical; by actively responding to online material, students can define their positions in the context of the writings of others and also express their own perspectives on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa, a beautiful, bilingual capital of Canada, offers many art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south, you'll find Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more adventures await in Ontario, which is a quintessential Canadian experience for outsiders.
The vast area in the far north is sparsely populated, and some parts are almost uninhabitable deserts.
Many are surprised by this population comparison: There are more African Americans in the US than the entire population of Canada.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean near the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is still the largest, and a continent of its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are famous for their expensive beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam inland, and it landed in a big way in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The northern part of the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
The women: It is recommended that any woman traveling should say that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can help (one that doesn't look too expensive).
It is important for women to understand that cultural differences can result in what they consider rape, and that this is not usually tolerated, overlooked, etc.
Be strong in avoiding men, and don't be afraid to depend on yourself (whether or not cultures differ, that's not an issue).
The Berber fishermen founded the modern city of Casablanca in the 10th century BCE, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used it as a strategic anchorage called Anfa.
This was destroyed by the Portuguese and rebuilt with the new name Casa Branca, only to be abandoned after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and renamed it Daru I-Badya, which Spanish merchants, who helped build trading posts there, called Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities to visit in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling Moroccan goods, like tagines, pots, leather, hookahs, and various trinkets, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's roads, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is safe, it is necessary to first know the current fighting situation in North Kivu province before any travel outside of Goma.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for easier tracking of Mountain Gorillas in Africa.
You can ride a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) fare is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Part of the difficulty in using it is that "Timbuktu" has become used as a metaphor for an exotic, faraway land.
Currently, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its reputation attracts tourists, and it even has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered heritage sites in the world, due to the threat of desert sand.
This is one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' special PBS series, Wonders of the African World.
The city is very different from other cities in the country, because it has more of an Arab influence than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a diverse range of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered a flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Similar to the National Parks in South Africa, there is a daily conservation effort and an entrance fee to enter the park.
Purchasing a Wild Card can also help, allowing entry to any of the selected parks in South Africa or all of the National Parks of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gave the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the area that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of skyscrapers that define Hong Kong's skyline is likened to a sparkling postcard, beautifully adorned with the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the most beautiful view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to Kowloon across the water on the other side.
The largest part of urban development on Hong Kong Island involves extensive land reclamation from the sea in the north.
This is the place coveted by the British colonizers, and if you are looking for evidence of past territorial occupations, it is good to start in this place.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast across Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The portion of the forest located within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not mangrove swamps but one of the few remaining stands of the once-dense forest that covered the Ganges plain.
The area of the Suburbans is 3,850 square kilometers, km2, about a third of which is water.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has become a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district (across the river) bus station throughout the day, but most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Due to the buses in this district often being full of passengers, it is recommended to purchase tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a faster and more comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The bridge's height is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be used in September 2017, when the customs checkpoints are expected to be finished.
The Guarani are the most important indigenous group remaining in present-day Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practice subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to various indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century in Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", it was born as a result of the struggle between the conquering Spaniards and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began their period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Beginning with the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its local character and identity.
Argentina is famous because they have one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest polo tournament of the year will be held this December in Las Cañitas.
Small tournaments and fights can also be viewed here at other times of the year.
For information regarding tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP) at a 1:1 ratio.
You can exchange currency at a bank on the islands located in Stanley across from the FIC West shopping center.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also widely accepted.
Credit cards from distant islands are unlikely to be accepted, but British and United States currency may be accepted; inquire with the owners first to find out what payment methods are accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summertime there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate; in the warmer months, temperatures above +30°C are quite common.
The coolness can be deceiving: the temperature rarely stays consistently low, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than what the thermometer reads.
There isn't a distinct "wet" and "dry" season: rainfall remains high throughout the year.
Even though there are many animals in the park for people to see, the animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how tame they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Additionally, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking fragrant foods and keep your campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was established in the 1850s and became the official capital of Samoa in 1959.
The sea was the site of a major naval standoff in 1889 where seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave.
All ships sank, except for a British cruiser. Almost 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the death of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches because it has two harbors. The most popular ones are in three locations.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbor district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming areas, and most offer shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in Waitemata Harbour, above the bays of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
Sometimes families flock to these beaches with good shopping lined up along the coast. It is also safe for swimming.
The main local beer is "Numero Uno," it's not a complicated beer, but it's good and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
We have a lot of French wine available, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia might travel better.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign. "Espresso" is short black, cappuccino is topped with high froth (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate depends on the Belgian standard. The fruit springs are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and rarely do these damage the reefs.
But, still listen to the advice of the authorities, follow the signs, and be alert to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish can appear near the seashore and near river mouths from October to April north of 17°70. Sometimes they can also be seen outside of these areas.
Sharks are persistent, but they rarely attack people. Sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles. Crocodiles do not usually live in the sea, their main habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking early gives travelers the peace of mind of having accommodations when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, but it is possible to book other accommodations, such as campsites, through an agent.
Travel agents commonly offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or combined airfare and hotel accommodations.
They can also put your reservation on hold if you need more time to consider their offer or obtain other documents for your application (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests must be coursed through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, a significant number of those who come to music festivals decide to camp at the venue itself, and most attendees consider that to be an integral part of the experience.
If you really want to be close to the action, you need to go early to the parking area near the music.
Remember that even after the music has stopped playing on the main stages, there may still be parts of the festival that continue playing music until the dead of night.
In some festivals, there is a special camping area for families with children.
When crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, inspect the cabin area, as traveling through ice causes severe vibration for those affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises are only allowed a limited time to stay in the country. Passengers do not need a visa (see regulations).
Casinos often do everything they can to extend the time and money that guests spend. They often have no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
Most of them have special food, drinks, and entertainment to offer, to please their guests, and to prevent them from running away.
Some places offer free alcohol. Even so, drunkenness removes clarity, and every good gambler knows the importance of sobriety.
Anyone driving in high-altitude areas or over mountain passes should be prepared for the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the risk is higher and you cannot drive as if you were on asphalt.
If there is a snowstorm, enough snow falls hourly that can keep you indoors.
Visibility may be reduced due to falling or blowing snow, or due to fog or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic usually continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist draw in Africa and are the main reason for many visits.
The word safari, in its popular usage, refers to trips on land to see the amazing wildlife in Africa, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, may approach vehicles and standard equipment, allowing for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are better seen using binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or going "footing") involves walking, for just a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in different locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo is the only city in Asia that has hosted the Summer Olympics twice. It first hosted the games in 1964.
If you made travel and accommodation reservations for 2020 before the lockdowns were announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not apply through July 2020, which is when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most of the labels will be worth between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with the average labels being worth ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that they can lend out, even if one isn't in the room.
If an iron is not available, or you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can use a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the iron get too hot (which can cause scorching or even burning).
There are various methods to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific hazards.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in others, it requires longer.
The effectiveness of water filters varies, and if you have concerns, you might consider buying your water pre-filled in sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they have never seen before in their place of origin.
Pests contaminate food, cause irritation, or in severe cases, allergies, spread germs, or transmit infections.
Communicable diseases, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people due to force, cannot be called pests.
Buying from duty-free shops is an opportunity to purchase items without taxes and duties that are imposed in other places.
Travelers going to countries with heavy taxation sometimes set aside an additional amount of money, especially for products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh road, as you constantly traverse isolated rural areas.
If you are not trained to drive the roads in the country, use your better judgement: the area is very rugged, the roads are narrow, and sharp curves are abundant.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in preceding and subsequent sections — typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and it is important to adhere to them.
Surprisingly, the mobile phone service is stronger here than in many other remote areas, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are delicious, and in Bavaria, they are rich and varied, like those of their neighbor, Austria.
Fruit breads are common, such as apples baked into breads year-round, and cherries and plums that appear during the summer.
Many German breads also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other ground nuts. Popular cakes are often deliciously paired with a cup of strong coffee.

Stirrups are supports for the feet of a rider hanging on either side of a horse's saddle.
They provide great stability to the riders but have safety concerns because they can be attached to the rider's foot.
If a rider falls from a horse and their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs. To reduce the risk, some safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Next, some horse saddles, especially English saddles, have a safety iron that separates the leather support for the foot from the saddle if a falling rider is dragged.

Similarly, having a Schengen visa means you no longer need to get visas for other Schengen member countries, saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal agreement on how to define something as antique. Some tax agencies consider items older than 100 years as antique.

Rip currents are return flows of water going back to the sea, mostly at a reef or flat area.
Due to the underwater topography, the backflow is directed to rare deep sections, and faster currents in deep water can originate there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion from swimming against the current, which is nearly impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back won't be difficult.
