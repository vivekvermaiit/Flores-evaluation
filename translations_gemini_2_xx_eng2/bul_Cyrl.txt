This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely popular, but also provides details that fossils generally do not, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the feathers of this animal were chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-pigmented underside.
The discovery also provides an opportunity to gain insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—researchers conclude that the rachis is likely a later evolutionary development compared to the other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. According to researchers, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult specimen, not downy fluff.
Researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult, not the down of a young individual.

Light and rotation used together define the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less magnetically active the star is in terms of reversals.

The work done was primarily theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon pulls on the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way it affects ordinary matter.
This theory posits that most of the dark matter surrounding a given galaxy is located around the galaxy in the form of a halo and consists of numerous small particles.

"Their thermal state isn't as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with them being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the USGS Astrogeology Science Center and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Traditionally, voting in France is low-tech: voters isolate themselves in a booth, mark their chosen candidate on a pre-printed sheet of paper, and place it in an envelope.
After officials confirm the voter's identity, he or she places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French law on elections quite strictly defines the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are inserted other than those of duly counted and eligible voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

In the next competition, the Giant Slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting group with a combined running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyoengyi Dani, who finished ninth.
Four women from the sit-ski group did not finish their laps, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the competition.
Police in Madhya Pradesh have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D. K. Arya stated that they had arrested the five people who raped the Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop.
Baba Kanjar, Buta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar are the names of the accused.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police chief, stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road is temporarily closed where the accident occurred so that emergency services can extract the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoja has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then, accused of the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any witness testimony could be tainted because her image has been widely circulated.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts view publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "it appears journalists are walking a dangerous line if they disseminate photos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for criminal prosecutions, told reporters that no further comments would be made until charges are brought.
According to the leaked information, the document will relate to the border dispute that Palestine wants based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other reflected topics are believed to be the future state of Jerusalem, sacred to both sides, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Following the signing of the agreement, Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years, while Pennsylvania agrees to implement such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control test were to be closely supervised by rangers, as the test was being observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
Within the framework of the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia's hunting program, qualified volunteers were engaged in partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting Director of Conservation and Heritage at the National Parks and Wildlife Service NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial cull received detailed safety briefings and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before the nine-member new provisional electoral council.
This is Martelly's fifth interim electoral council in four years.
Last month, a commission to the president recommended the resignation of the previous electoral commission (CEC) as part of a package of measures to take the country to new elections.
Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime, which began in October, was the commission.
Violent protests were sometimes triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been expected since 2011.
Around 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod devices have been reported. Overheating has been reported, causing a total of six fires and inflicting minor burns on four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 incidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry responded, calling Apple's delay of the report "truly regrettable."
Mariana was shaken by an earthquake at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The emergency services in the Northern Mariana Islands reported that there was no damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman held tourists hostage in Hong Kong, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and there are currently at least six confirmed fatalities.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released earlier.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady who needed the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a medical career.
She trained as a midwife and began working at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature birth in his free time.
His research shows that if a hormone is applied, it will accelerate the fetal development of the baby's lungs.
Government investigators found two flight recording "black boxes" on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.
Tribute was also paid to Luna by fellow wrestlers.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. Quite unique, like her. She was a strong woman."
"Luna is strange like me... maybe even more so... I love her and I will miss her... let's hope she is in a better place," commented Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
Of the 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those who oppose the idea of Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of the respondents, who want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Ultimately, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and participate in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition is in doubt.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to manage the pain because it was banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different software and hardware before the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth, along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how the Earth formed, after comets collided with Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political babble and nonsense."
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that NextGen is a system that will allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
She uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to allow flight controllers to provide pilots with more accurate information and to pinpoint the exact location of aircraft.
There will be no extra transport, and ground-level trains will not stop at Wembley; also, there is no parking or park-and-ride facilities available at the venue.
The fear of lack of transport raised the possibility that the game might have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that new species have evolved in just two generations, despite the fact that this process was thought to take much longer, due to mating between the endemic Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis), and the non-native cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any shape. It can be hammered into tiny forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be braided and twisted, and then it can be forged or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal. So thin, that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books, known as "illuminated manuscripts".
This is the pH of a chemical substance. By using red cabbage juice, you can make an indicator.
Depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) a chemical is, cabbage juice changes its color.
The amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical indicates the pH level.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powdered substances together and then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, you'll feel it a little strange, and something like a coating will form.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with running water in almost every house, connected to a complex sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems were discovered in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women in mixed company gathered together.
You use a satellite when you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away.
The satellite in space receives the call and almost instantly reflects it back.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To put a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The biggest thing we have thanks to the wheel is much easier and faster transportation.
He gave us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are mid-sized cats, feeding on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
And lastly, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) preying on far more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a specific job each cat occupies, which protects it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Packs consist of one to three adult male relatives, along with up to thirty females and young.
The females are usually closely related, a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides operate much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and just as deadly to their prey.
The tiger, like a well-rounded athlete, can climb (although not well), swim, make huge leaps, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones known for roaring.
The roar of a tiger doesn't fully resemble a lion's roar, but rather sounds like uttering growling, screaming words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) through their sense of smell, sniffing for where they have been on the ground.
With their night vision, they see very well in the dark and move very silently. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and pouncing on their victim.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it passes through a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island, making return difficult), it will often find itself in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different functions or adaptations than before in order to be a strong competitor.
The indigenous population hasn't changed at all; it still requires the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it starts to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will diverge so much that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which people exhale.
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, and we make clothes from them too. Most edible foods are plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of his mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. Rex couldn't compete with it.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans also had some rather strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
The other difference was that while the poor people and the women ate sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together, reclining sideways while they ate.
It is impossible that ancient Roman dishes included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn, nor potatoes, nor tomatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy their needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not of such importance.
Most of the Jewish family's life takes place outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard; the shops were just shelves facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
In the Land of Canaan, there were no extensive forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. The Scandinavian sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and traveling west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each of the countries was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland.
You might think that the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence if you've seen the movie "National Treasure."
However, that's not true. It's not a treasure map, even though there's something written on the back of the document.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated 4th July 1776" are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text appears at the bottom of the document upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that initially, after it was created, the large parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Most likely, the notation was added only as a label.
With the D-Day landings and subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by the French from Vichy. These were Frenchmen who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
The Allies landed in Southern France on August 15, 1944, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, American and French forces liberate Southern France and advance towards Germany.
Civilization represents a culture shared by a significant and large group of people working and living together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means "civic" or "relating to citizens," connected to the Latin words "civis" or "citizen" and "civitas," which means "city" or "city-state," and this somehow defines the size of the society as well.
City-states were precursors to nations. Culture in the context of civilization implies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and natural dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving behind sufficient historical evidence of their existence, and therefore fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government, with Congress being its sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and since there was no national judiciary or executive, it relied on state authorities, who often refused to cooperate, to enforce its acts.
It also has no power to reject tax laws or interstate tariffs.
The clauses required unanimous consent from all states in order to be amended, and the states treated the central government so unseriously that their representatives were often absent.
Along with the German national football team, the Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world. They were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, volleyball, basketball, cycling, water polo, fencing, rugby, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in both international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan possesses nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes it the seventh largest island country in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, as a geographical concept, it is often referred to as an "archipelago".
Taiwan traces its origins back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as "Ilha Formosa" or "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing changes to local grain production customs and hiring Chinese workers to labor in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the northern and western coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following the loss of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures, namely the Temple of the Sun, the Intihuatana, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of how they originated.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
The most common format for still photography in the world, for example, is 35mm. This was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, its image format has been inherited by the sensor image formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer denominator), therefore, is 3:2.
Equal to or very close to this ratio are very common formats (for example, the APS group of formats).
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple rule that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in the image.
It states that the most suitable place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the photo into thirds vertically and horizontally (See example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had already become wealthy and powerful, was subjected to criticism.
The Christian religion has connected European countries for over a thousand years, despite linguistic differences and various customs.
His all-encompassing power affected everyone - from the king to the common man.
A core Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church continued in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money leads many to question whether that principle was upheld.
Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
Although this blockade violated customary international law, codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries, the strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies.
Great Britain is mining international waters to prevent ships from entering certain areas of the ocean, creating a danger even for neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic is limited, Germany expects a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, a sentiment of pacifism and isolationism prevailed among most citizens and nations.
The people wanted to avoid a military situation again in the future, after seeing the horrors and atrocities of the war during World War I.
To accept a job at the Edison company in New York, Tesla moved to the United States in 1884.
He arrives in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a poetry collection, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchellor (his manager at his previous job).
In Ancient China, there existed a unique way of indicating different periods of time; for each stage of history or for each family in power, there was a separate dynasty.
Between every two dynasties, there was also an unstable time of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods is the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, there was a fierce war between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China. Fighting to sit on the highest seat in the magnificent Xian palace, thousands of people perished.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not just to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, the classes were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, because instead of the army unit being based on class, it is now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also served as an inspiration for many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this worldly life. To contemplate, he often visited a cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount Nur (light).
The cave itself, having survived through time, conveys a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you enter the cave, the isolation is complete.
Nothing else is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above us and the many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists.
Erected by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures constructed to honor the deceased pharaoh.
In the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, on the Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," there are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid is in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples are in honor of his wives and family members.
The "arc up" symbol looks like a V, and the "arc down" symbol looks like a staple or a bottomless square.
Up-bow means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down-bow means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and then draw it.
An up-bow typically produces a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to add your own markings, but remember that the printed bow strokes are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), as well as the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and yelling threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, one of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard, killed at Versailles, in front of the horrified queen.
The Filipinos themselves paid the military costs of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines.
The US colonial regime forced them to pay taxes to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
The super-profits obtained from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people represent, of course, the main gains of American imperialism.
To understand the meaning of the Templar Order, one must understand the context that led to its creation.
The period during which the events took place is usually called the Late Middle Ages - the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages are preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500 AD.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice - from technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Two common ideas are shared among most interpretations of technological determinism: the development of technology itself follows a path far exceeding cultural or political influence, or technology itself influences societies inherently rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network will not be economically viable for just a handful of cars, therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of cars also led to a higher frequency of road accidents, which necessitated the invention of new techniques in healthcare for the recovery of damaged bodies.
Romanticism contains a significant element of cultural determinism, the origins of which can be traced back to writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time, customs and culture arise that are connected to this geography, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury dates back to around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Her status declined in the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the crusaders were returning with gifts such as spices and silk, which were more valued than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
Around this time, the title "Fashion Capital" shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and the 14th centuries.
In the beginning, clothing was very strongly influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication, Western styles can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. As a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes, which is one of the biggest developments of that time.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is carried out to produce enough food solely for the needs of the farmer and his family.
Market gardening is a simple, often organic system, frequently using saved seeds from the same ecological region, combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence farming, and this still holds true for many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel neglected by societal standards. They allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as independent can be of a linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic nature, or a combination of factors.
Members of a given subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most frequently used ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is the example of several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, mistreatment, or intentional violence, were not socialized by adults during their developmental years.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been kept confined by people (usually their own parents); sometimes the abandonment of such children was due to parents rejecting a severe intellectual or physical disability in the child.
Feral children may have been severely abused or traumatized before being abandoned or running away.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When fully raised by animals, a feral child demonstrates behavior (within physical limitations) almost entirely resembling that of the specific animal that cared for it, as well as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning is meant to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method but rather assistance that provides support to individuals going through new training, such as a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold, as is the little paperclip person in Microsoft Office.
The software has built-in virtual scaffolds designed to ask questions, prompt, and explain procedures that may have been too difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster families for many different reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not encouraging, nurturing, and educational, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is expected to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide everything necessary that was lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass and individual communication.
The special characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions regarding the application of the satisficing approach.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are cited as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "sustained relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks points out how, regardless of their inability to comprehend the speech due to brain damage, people are able to perceive sincere attitude.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior might be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Studies in the twentieth century showed that there are 2 groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations back and forth between the two gene pools with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its need for amino acids through the available plant resources.
Moreover, the consequences of failure are serious: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources would be proteins from leaves and legume seeds, but they are difficult for us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, foods of animal origin (termites, ants, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a large amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
Considering all this, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep procrastination is the process of intentionally waking up during your usual sleep time and going back to sleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself turning off your alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other bio-rhythm based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before bed, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The less tension there is, the more positive the life force. Every person has the potential to discover absolute peace and satisfaction.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. Our own tension and negativity are the only things standing in our way of achieving that goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been further developed by many techniques from Indian yoga and the Mahayana path of love.
Tibetan Buddhism is built on a very simple principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (energy for enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, visualizations, and mantras.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and enlightenment of consciousness is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, differences in system, process, and culture led to conflict between these countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It continued for the next 40 years and was a real battle waged through mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Cuba, Afghanistan, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat along the Romanian bridgehead and reconsider its organization.
These plans, however, became invalid almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after seizing the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move huge numbers of people and cargo across the oceans.
The traditional role of naval fleets is to ensure your country's ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the last most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to get people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy is trying to stop this traffic, mainly with the help of submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have conquered Great Britain, similar to the rest of Europe.
Goats were likely first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them in order to have easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually raised in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often accompanied by goatherds, who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd. These herding methods are still used.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the trackways consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to achieve greater speeds and pull larger loads than on the more uneven roads typical of the time.
The sleepers were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place. However, it was gradually understood that the rails would be more effective with an iron band on top.
This had become a common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Gradually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, with humans starting to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (or the upright man).
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, usually did not walk upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in australopithecine fossils dating back 4.2–3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living with more care for the environment, join an environmental movement, and even become activists, in order to reduce the negative impacts in the future to some extent.
In many cases, this is just like symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want only a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is evident that the world has changed significantly due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and the problems have become greater due to overpopulation and people's extravagant lifestyles.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th and signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, the handwritten copy was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap, located a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The document was read publicly for the first time by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his soldiers on July 9th in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 extant Dunlap broadside printings are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived.
Nowadays, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives even today. We call them birds.
Because they have feathers and can fly, many people don't think of them as dinosaurs.
But for birds, which still resemble dinosaurs, there's a lot going on.
They have legs with claws and scales, walk on their two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex, and lay eggs.
Almost all computers used today function based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning does not always manifest immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are too common to make a diagnosis right away.
The presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals may be the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions regarding this poison.
The term "bug" is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term originates from the age-old acquaintance with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both flying termites and common termites are colorless and live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies show that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
Upon adoption, the parental rights of the biological parents are terminated, after which the other couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
It's not just experimentation, although experiments are used to eliminate some of the possible hypotheses; asking questions and using guides also accompany scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers work more with classical texts, and especially with the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek scientific and philosophical roots.
In physiology and behavior, many of the observed rhythms often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are more than just reactions to external periodic signals have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to cycle in free-running conditions, even in the absence of external cues.
One of the leading assumptions that DNA is genetic material was the experiment performed by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to graft their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled either the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells, mutations can have a wide variety of effects.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is attractive to people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wild plant and animal species.
Activities that can be done here include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as learning about the ecosystem.
Visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo are examples of this.
Every morning, to get to their workplaces, people travel by car from small provincial towns and pass others whose work destination is the place that the first group has just left.
In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is to some extent connected to and supports the transportation system through private cars.
That this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the past two million years, is now shown by science.
Every person is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
Developed countries rarely have so many complaints about water quality or crumbling bridges.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more important happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Since driver behavior unfortunately cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty, studying traffic flow is difficult.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus, traffic flows have a certain logical consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better illustrate the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main characteristics have been defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections help with the planning, design, and ultimately the operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the skies. Their ability to fly has helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings today.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people think he is right, but many are of the opposite opinion - that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because you don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second-longest river on Earth. It carries over 8 times more water than the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching 6 miles wide in some places.
The Amazon provides a full 20 percent of all the water that pours from the planet's rivers into the oceans.
The Amazon River's length is 6387 km (3980 miles). Thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which monuments were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the country with the smallest population and the smallest independent state in the world.
The Vatican uses the Italian language in its legislation and for official communication.
While Latin is often used in religious ceremonies, Italian is the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state.
All subjects of the Vatican are Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as they can all be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is composed of one or more of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, it was like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys also exist that include small amounts of nonmetal elements, such as carbon.
The universe is made of matter, which in turn is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
So, when it appeared, the pencil was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and use.
People nowadays type messages on computer screens and don't have to touch pencil sharpeners.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer appears.
A plutonium bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Then, splitting the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which is why they tend to decay with little or no stimulus.
The lunar surface consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There might be more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner there. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of happiness are focused on discovering what makes people respond or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that, by the time they reach adulthood, have been internalized.
These theories examine what motivates certain people to want the things they do, and which elements in their environment will cause them to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's "Hierarchy of Needs" and Herzberg's "Two-Factor Theory of Motivation" are the two popular content theories.
Generally speaking, after managers begin to lead their former colleagues, two behaviors are possible. On the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
These types of managers encounter difficulties in implementing disciplinary measures, making unpopular decisions, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
A person transforms, at the other end of the spectrum, into an unrecognizable individual who feels they need to change everything the team has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's successes and failures.
Such behavior often leads to a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet across different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a truly "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
"The 'Invisible Team' is the management team to which each member reports. This team sets the standards for each member."
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of creating a learning organization? Innovation in practice is one of the goals for implementing organizational learning concepts.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the organization's work process for overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process in service of the client's needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, its leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as organizational learning and shared knowledge.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provide the physical evidence for the theoretical approach in the study of cognition. This narrows the field of study and makes it much more precise.
The link between pathology and brain behavior supports scientists' research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that were previously unseen.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our consciousness.
Although artificial intelligence features heavily in science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the learning, behavior, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence includes creating machines that can automatically perform tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Some examples that can be listed include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Similar problems have evolved into distinct disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life issues.
The artificial intelligence system, which is embedded in several home computer and video game software applications, is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military affairs.
Excursions are a big part of school education. Very often, a teacher would like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The technology offers a solution through virtual tours. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire the beauty of art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina create a webpage about their trip to the state capital; each year this page is remodeled, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a sketchbook.
Blogs can be helpful in improving students' writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes that.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blog author, in order to avoid criticism, has started striving to improve their writing.
Also, blogging "forces students to be more aware of the world around them." The need to cultivate the audience's interest inspires students to be interesting and smart (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the regular school day.
Through the appropriate use of blogs, students can be empowered to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet materials in the context of other people's writings, students can define their own positions and also outline their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada, home to a number of art galleries and museums where you can explore Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, while to the north lie the pristine natural beauties of Muskoka and the surrounding lands.
All these things solidify Ontario as a model of what is typically Canadian according to foreigners.
The vast northern regions are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabitable deserts.
A population comparison that has surprised many: the number of African Americans in the US is greater than that of Canadian citizens.
East African islands are in the Indian Ocean near the African east coast.
Madagascar is the largest and, in itself, a separate continent in terms of wildlife.
Most small islands are independent nations or are associated with France and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it had a major influence on the Comoros Islands and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the "Cape of Good Hope" route, the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the west and south, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that every traveling woman declare herself as married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's nice to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can give rise to situations they perceive as harassment, in which they are often followed, grabbed by the hand, and so on.
Be firm when refusing men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and used by Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroy it and rebuild it under the name "Casa Branca", but abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Beida, and it received the name Casablanca from Spanish merchants who established their trading posts there.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
It's easy to find places around the old Medina that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east, bordering Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city's streets, especially the center.
While Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside of Goma should be researched to understand the state of the fighting that continues in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest ways to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use "boda-bodas" (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
"Timbuktu", coupled with its relative inaccessibility, has acquired use as a metaphor for exotic, far-off lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though it has been turned into a tourist attraction due to its reputation and has an airport.
It was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites in 1990 due to the threat of desert sands.
This was one of the key stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS show "Africa's Great Civilizations."
The city sharply differs from the other cities in the country, because it has more of an Arabic look than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and extends east along the border with Mozambique, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River is its southern boundary.
The park spans 19,500 km², divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each with different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Typically, all South African national parks require daily entrance and park conservation fees.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists consider worth visiting.
The line of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline is often likened to a glittering bar graph, standing out against the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To best experience Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of the developed part of Hong Kong Island is densely situated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that British colonizers appropriated, and if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of this territory, it's a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within Indian territory is called Sundarban National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps – they include some of the last remnants of the great jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans occupy an area of 3850 km², with almost one-third of this territory covered by water and swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is believed that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave throughout the day from the intercity bus station (behind the river), although most of them, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
It is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance, as intercity buses are often full.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and reliable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel short distances, such as to Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two masts rise to 83 meters, the length is 378 meters, with 2 sails that are 3.50 meters wide each.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge should be put into operation in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous tribe, whose members inhabited present-day Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who have survived by hunting, gathering fruit, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," was born in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and local groups.
The Spanish began the colonial period, which lasted three centuries.
Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and individual polo players in the world.
The biggest annual tournament is held in December at the Las Canitas polo field.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be watched here at other times of the year.
Check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo for news regarding tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which has a value equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the bank located in Stanley across from the FIC West store, which is the only one on the islands.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and US dollars are also often accepted within Stanley credit cards.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outer islands, but British and American currency may be used; speak with the hosts in advance to find out which method of payment is acceptable.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; temperatures above +30 °C are normal during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combined wind and humidity lead to a feeling of being colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept the necessary distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so do not enter their personal space.
In addition, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid wearing or cooking fragrant food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000 people.
Apia, the official capital of Samoa since 1959, was founded in the 1850s.
A scandalous naval clash unfolded at the port in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of one British cruiser. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the Mau movement's organized struggle for independence, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the assassination of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland spans two harbors, it has many beaches. The most popular ones are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are guarded sandy beaches for swimming, and most have shade under pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are near the Waitemata Harbour, on the outskirts of the expensive Mission Bay and St Heliers areas in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One". It's not a heavy beer, but rather pleasant and refreshing. "Manta" is the name of the other local beer.
There are many French wines to try, but New Zealand and Australian ones might go down better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you're worried.
The concept of a "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians. A short black is an "espresso," a cappuccino is piled high with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets the standard for Belgian. The fruit juices are a bit pricey, but wonderful.
Many of the reef trips are year-round, and accidents on the reef caused by any of these reasons are rare.
Still, pay attention to the advice of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay special attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the town of 1770. They can sometimes be encountered outside of this period as well.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance provides peace of mind for the traveler, ensuring they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can find other accommodation options, such as campsites, through a travel agent as well.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
Nevertheless, any changes or requests should be directed to the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, a vast majority of attendees choose to camp on the festival grounds, and most consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you'll need to go early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages may be over, there may be festival stages where music will continue to be played late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the hut, as for the most affected, crossing the ice causes a rather terrible noise.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos typically put a lot of effort into making guests spend as much time and money as possible. Generally, there are no windows or clocks, and the exits can be difficult to find.
To keep guests in good spirits and keep them in the venue, they usually offer special food, drinks and entertainment deals.
Free alcoholic drinks are offered in some places. However, drunkenness affects judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who will be driving at high altitudes or through mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive as you would on clear asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time that you could get stranded.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or blizzard, as well as by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snowfall are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist draw in Africa and a final destination for many visitors.
The term "safari" in its popular usage refers to a trip overland to view the amazing African wildlife, specifically in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to the vehicles, providing a good view with standard equipment.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy and are best observed with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "wilderness walk," "hiking safari," or "foot safari") is a walk lasting several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held between August 24th and September 5th, 2021. Some of the events will take place in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, following its hosting of the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the season postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies were not being extended to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Expectations are that most tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available to borrow, even if there aren't any in the room.
If there is no iron, or you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if there is one available.
Do not allow the fabric to get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
Water can be purified in different ways, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others, several minutes are necessary.
Filters have varying effectiveness, and if you're concerned, you should consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pest animals that are unfamiliar to them from their native regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals, which can injure or kill people with force, do not usually qualify as pests in themselves.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods without taxes and excise duties in specific locations.
Travelers going to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated, remote areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be alert: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are prevalent.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous or subsequent sections, where they are usually 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h), and strict adherence to them is more important than in other locations.
The curious thing is, however, that the mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are exceptionally good, and Bavarian ones are quite rich and diverse, similar to those prepared in their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples being used in pastries year-round, and cherries and plums being used in the summer.
Many German baked goods include almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small, yet rich pastries, try these which, depending on the region, are called berliners, pfannkuchen, or krapfen.
Curry is a dish made with meat or vegetables, herbs, and spices.
Depending on the amount of liquid, the curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is most commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing a vast array of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without additional qualifiers, the term usually refers to dishes originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Nowadays widespread in the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a variety of simply seasoned dishes, and the predominant flavors that Javanese people prefer are chili peppers, peanuts, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), as well as various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, hanging from both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but safety concerns can arise due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
In the event a rider is thrown from a horse and his foot becomes caught in the stirrup, he will be dragged if the horse bolts. A number of safety precautions can be taken to minimize this risk.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, narrow sole.
Later, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cochamo Valley - the best climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with an abundance of large granite walls and cliffs.
The ridges offer breathtaking views from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes amidst the endless potential of the walls.
Snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular activities involving descending a snow-covered surface with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with many enthusiasts, often known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations centered around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing dates back as a sport to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians founded the first sports ski club in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
They are similar, but usually do not include alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, as the latter take place on steeper terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you'll be able to cover slightly greater distances than if you were walking – but you will very rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean repeatedly dealing with visa applications and passport control.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
While you are within this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, if you hold a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for separate visas for each of the Schengen member states, thus saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as items more than 100 years old.
The definition has geographical variations, with the age limit potentially being lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be considered antiques, even though they are not as old as antique mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this livelihood is also important to many with other crafts.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but survived by fishing, hunting, and the like, with reindeer being primarily draught animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern professions. Tourism is a profitable industry in Sápmi, one of the regions where the Sami live.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "tsiganin" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate representations of the Roma people.
If the country you are visiting enters a travel advisory bulletin, this may affect your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You may want to consult with other governments as well, but the advice of those governments is intended for their own citizens.
American citizens in the Middle East, for example, may find themselves in different situations from Europeans or Arabs.
Conferences are nothing more than a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and its manifestations are very diverse and can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are all forms and influences of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather conditions include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers need to be aware of any risk of severe weather conditions affecting their area, as these may impact any travel plans.
Any person planning a visit to a country that could be designated a war zone should receive professional training.
The address of a local company will likely be provided when searching the internet for "hostile environment course."
The course usually covers all the issues discussed here, but in much greater detail and typically in combination with practical exercises.
The course is usually 2 to 5 days long and includes role-playing, many first aid activities, and sometimes weapons handling training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but there are few publications that address war zones.
Passengers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they carry valid return travel documents.
Governments vary in their willingness to issue passports to persons with indeterminate sex (X) or to update documents to reflect desired names and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to abide by these documents is also a variable.
Searches at checkpoints have also become much more thorough in the period after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people awaiting surgery should not expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves that break on the shore, often at a reef or something similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid current towards the deep water can form there.
Most deaths are due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which is likely impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back isn't any more difficult than usual.
Try to aim somewhere you won't get caught again, or you might want to wait for rescue, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted.
Reverse culture shock comes on faster than culture shock (it has a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have found it relatively easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own.
When you return home after living abroad, where you've adapted to the new culture there, you've lost some of your habits from your home culture.
Initially, when you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that those arriving in a new country need to adapt.
People may not expect that returning travelers also need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence, before the show begins.
You usually always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The story of light and sound is like a fairy tale book.
The Sphinx serves as a backdrop and narrator of a long history.
The scenes are presented on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
Several nations lay claim to the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and they have the most bases there, with sixteen of them being active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest island.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where there is a spectacular natural harbor due to the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Antarctic Peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula's mountains merge into the plateau, after which they rise again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, dissected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or Sentinel Range, is located the highest mountain in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Vinson Peak reaching 4892 m.
In remote locations with no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors with a direct line of sight to the satellite in order to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used by maritime navigation, including recreational vessels, as well as expeditions that require remote data and voice communications.
More information on connecting to this service can be provided by your local telephone service provider.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular among school graduates, giving them a gap year before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year could improve your chances of enrolling in higher education in your home country.
There is usually a "tuition" fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a wonderful destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands located in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and largest lakes are indeed big enough for yachts, smaller boats and kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
The number is the same in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is from 1 to 40).
Most reputable Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you will be able to visit the historic city for a full two days, returning to and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you disembark using ship-organized tours, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Berlin, Germany is featured in some of the cruise brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea at all, and the price of the cruise does not include a visit to the city.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have experienced a traumatic event or have never flown before.
This is not something we should be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and hatred of other things that a great number of people have.
For some people, understanding how aircraft work, as well as what happens during a flight, can help overcome fear that is based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Courier companies are paid well to deliver things quickly. Time is often very important for business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller firms, this has been a problem.
If they shipped things by air, unloading and customs clearance can take days on some routes.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline rules do not allow sending baggage without a passenger, which is your case.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a hefty sum for the privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: in principle, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times more for first class!
Basically, there's no point in even looking for discounts for business or first class for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a significantly higher price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and consequently be charged for it.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the secession of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, which, although with its own government and currency, is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
With a population of approximately 3.7 million, Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Nestled around a vast gulf and surrounded by mountains, the once ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and vibrant commercial center.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers alternate with traditional red roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the atmosphere in the city is closer to Mediterranean Europe than to traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík has a panorama of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above some of the tombs.
It's worth taking half an hour to walk around the charming village.
A short distance to the north is the romantic and charming town of Sintra, known to foreigners following a glowing account of its splendor written by Lord Byron.
Scotturb bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
To the north, also visit the beautiful Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (altar), a place of world-renowned Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are visiting a mass grave, as well as a place of immeasurable significance to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived here, and many others who had close ones and loved ones killed or who died from working there, both Jews and others.
Please treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the property by marking or scratching graffiti on buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, because by law it is the primary official language.
At the same time, Spanish is widely used in public transport and other facilities.
On the subway, regular announcements are only made in Catalan, but the automated system announces unscheduled disruptions in a wide range of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant people.
Even though this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get around Paris is still by observing good behavior and acting with a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) attitude. This will significantly facilitate your sightseeing.
The jaded exterior of Parisians will quickly vanish if you show a little politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has dense forests, mainly of beech, spruce and fir, with mixed Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the variety of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitudes, there is an exceptionally large diversity of plant communities.
The region is also home to an extremely diverse range of animals and birds.
Rare fauna species can be seen there, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, along with many other common species.
During their visit to the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts below the knees, and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries provide shawls for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially in bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun right at the entrance.
Following the same logic, men should wear pants that cover their knees.
Clothing can be borrowed from what is available at the entrance, but it is not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
As in similar areas in the Mediterranean, Majorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple popular dinner, especially in the summer, is "pa amb oli": bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available product like cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word "Sie" - "You" (formal), are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important rule for distinguishing some verbs from objects.
It is believed to facilitate reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to understand whether the verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are spelled.
The main letters to watch out for are "c" and "g" because their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also, make sure you pronounce R and RR differently: caro means dear, while carro means chariot.
Persian is an easy language and has relatively straightforward grammar.
Therefore, this grammar guide will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand phrases better.
Of course, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
People who know a little Spanish, however, may hastily decide that Portuguese is close enough that they don't need to study it separately.
These observatories, predating today's modern ones, are usually obsolete and are now used as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution, even at its peak, was not the problem it is today, they were typically located in cities or on campuses, and are more easily accessible than those built nowadays.
Most modern survey telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as "hanami," has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where plum blossoms are the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy in the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to pick even "just one."
During a visit to a well-kept garden, you will be thrown out without discussion for picking "samples."
Singapore, as a whole, is an extremely safe place. It's very easy to get around, and you can also buy almost anything after you arrive.
But once you're in the "deep tropics," just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to deal with both the heat (constantly) and the strong sun (less often, when the sky is clear).
There are also several buses heading north towards Hebron, where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are traditionally buried.
Check the bus you're planning to take to make sure it goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis as a vacation theme.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire or Rhine valleys, or a cruise to interesting cities along the Danube, or boating on the Erie Canal.
They also set routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There's a tradition of spending Easter night awake outdoors to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is also possible that it represents a pre-Christian spring fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on the Saturday night of Easter weekend, with the congregation often beginning lively celebrations at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that initially arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, which turned the giant tortoise into the first herbivore on the Galapagos.
After the arrival of people on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals such as goats, cows, horses, rats, cats, and dogs were introduced there.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the Sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark almost around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and, therefore, light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last names or titles.
Harmony in the workplace is extremely important, with an emphasis on group efforts rather than the promotion of individual achievements.
Workers often have to get approval from superiors for every decision they make and are expected to follow their instructions without complaint.
