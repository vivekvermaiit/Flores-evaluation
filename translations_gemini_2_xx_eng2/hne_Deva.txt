This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely held, but the fossil also reveals details that are usually not possible to discern, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal had a burnt top with a yellow or carotenoid-colored underside like a plum.
The research also provides insights into the evolution of wings in birds.
Since dinosaurs lacked a well-developed rachis (the central shaft of a feather) due to their feathers, but possessed other feather characteristics - barbs and barbules - researchers speculate that the rachis likely developed later through evolutionary processes, along with other features.
The wing structure suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggest that even if it is a juvenile dinosaur's tail, the specimen appears to be an adult wing and not female.
The researchers suggested that even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and is probably not a female.
A bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey. Earlier, two police officers were murdered, and many more were injured.

Just as the moon creates a pull on the Earth, creating tides, similarly the Milky Way exerts a force on the Andromeda galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located in a type of halo around the galaxy and is made up of many small particles.

The government has also promised several million vials of encephalitis vaccine, which will help health agencies prepare for next year.
This year, the distribution of vaccines in the most historically affected areas has been delayed due to a shortage of funds and the relatively lower priority given to other diseases in the plan.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, inserting a pre-printed sheet of paper representing their preferred candidate.
After verification of the voter's identity by the officials, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law strictly codifies proceedings.
Since 1988, ballot boxes should be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes were present at the start of voting and that no envelopes were added except those duly counted and authorized by voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, following a specific procedure, the votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision.

The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhoot Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaja Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of Police Chandrashekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Although three people were inside the house, none of them were hurt when the car hit it.
However, the driver sustained a serious head injury.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed, while the emergency services were extracting the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, they sent him to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
He has been accused in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court of murdering his son since then.
He remains in pre-trial detention for pending charges and trials, but any eyewitness evidence that could lead to his conviction may be compromised because his image has been widely publicized.
In Britain, this is a common practice, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts have viewed the publication of any photographs as potentially prejudicial to the case.
Dundee Notes Professor Pamela Ferguson notes that "&quot;publishing photos of journalist suspects walks a dangerous line.&quot;"
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, has instructed journalists that there will be no further comment until at least the indictment.
According to leaks, the document will discuss the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the pre-1967 war borders.
The topics covered reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Despite once agreeing to sign an agreement, Israel is demanding a continuous military presence in the valley.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control test were to be closely supervised by the rangers, as they were to monitor the test and evaluate its effectiveness.
NPA in partnership with and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSSA) Inc, under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program, recruited eligible volunteers.
According to Mick O'Fallon, the acting director of Parks Conservation and NPW, the four shooters selected for Operation Heritage, the first shooting operation, received extensive safety and training instructions.
Yesterday, a new nine-member Election Council (CEP) was sworn in.
This is Marteli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a commission chair recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to take the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the large-scale anti-government protests scheduled to begin in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by failures to hold elections, some since 2011.
There have been reports of approximately 60 instances of overheating in exaggerated iPods, resulting in six fire incidents and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it had been made aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, Meta announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional instances of overheating, which the company referred to as "non-critical."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the "&quot;genuinely regrettable&quot; report.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Commonwealth Office of Emergency Management said that there was no damage in the country.
Besides this, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that there was no tsunami threat.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza pointed his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed so far.
The six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released quickly, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took turns covering for each of the old women because she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza had already been shut down.
Liggin also followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When she was working at the hospital, Ligins started researching preterm labor in her free time.
His research revealed that if a certain hormone was administered, it would accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs in the baby.
Sinhois stated that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna's passing was like the twilight of two moons. So unique. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented "Luna was as weird as me... maybe even more so... Love her and will miss her... Hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic, and therefore oppose the Australian system, has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
In a survey, 34 percent of people are sharing this view that they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Among those surveyed, 29 percent believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but their fitness was in doubt due to their complaints.
He was unable to get the necessary medicine to relieve his pain because he had been banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Many people, using various hardware and software, confirmed the discovery by the beginning of February, and the announcement was made on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of delivery of water to Earth along with organic matter, which could create proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
53, Cuomo began his governorship at the start of this year and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
They referred to the rumors as "political sycophancy and foolishness."
He was expected to score runs for the chairman in 2016.
NextGen is a system that will allow FAA-equipped aircraft to fly more direct routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and cutting carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology, unlike older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There is no additional transportation being provided and Overground trains are not stopping at Wembley, and there is no car parking or park-and-ride facility on the ground.
The lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors, without the team's supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Gal√°pagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although the process would normally take much longer due to breeding between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be spun into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can be bent and pleated. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and can be incorporated into other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called a chemical pH. You can make an indicator by using the juice of red Goghalo.
Goghalo juice changes color based on whether it is in an acidic or alkaline (basic) chemical environment.
The pH level test indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms contain one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean, cupped hands, squeeze them into a ball.
Your hands will react with the moisture and external layers, which will feel fun and create a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Traces of sewage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is a thousand miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite is receiving a call in space and then returning it almost immediately.
A satellite was being sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and views.
It is taking a huge 100-foot-tall rocket to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. For us, the greatest thing about the wheel is that it has provided us with very easy and fast transportation.
This brings us trains, cars, and many other transportation equipment.
Under it, there are more medium-sized wildcats who eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey, like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of "Aala", a specific job each cat holds, which prevents it from competing with others.
I am the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
The procession consisted of one to three related adult males, along with thirty women and children.
Within a large family of daughters-in-law and daughters, there is a playful, intimate connection with each other.
The honey badger works like a pack of jackals or wild dogs, surprisingly similar to lions (but other big cats) in terms of animals, and also very deadly for its prey.
A good, well-rounded athlete can climb like a tiger (though not perfectly), swim long distances, jump high, and pull five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These are the only four cats that can roar.
The tiger's roar isn't like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a cough, a shouted word.
Ocelots (a medium-sized wild cat) like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that they keep ocelots and feed animals by smell (hunt), sniffing where they live in the ground.
With their twilight vision, they can see very well even in the dark, and can also move forward very quietly. Ocelots blend in with their prey to stalk them, then ambush them.
When a small group (a small population) of living things becomes separated from the main population (such as if they move to a mountain range or river, or if they go to a new island so they can't easily go back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in initially.
In this new environment, there are various resources and various competitors; therefore, the new population will need different amenities or adaptations that will require them to be stronger competitors compared to their previous needs.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, because new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they start to look less and less like the originating population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make fences from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaw was lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included limans, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have also been a cannibal.
It affected everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. Rex would be no match for it.
While much of their food would have been familiar to us, the Romans also had access to artificial or unusual delicacies like wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent.
Another difference was that the poor people and women seated in the chairs ate their food, while the wealthy men preferred to feast together where they would lounge on their sides after they had eaten their meal.
Ancient Roman food could not have included foods that later came to Europe from the Americas or Asia through trade.
For example, he didn't have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
People will offer sacrifices to the deities, and the priests will try to attend to the needs of the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, known as ziggurats, were built to be part of temple complexes.
The tower's top was a special sanctuary for the deity.
In the early days, when the weather was warm, houses weren't so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent in open huts.
The women were cooking in the yard; open counters were seen in the store on the street. Stones were used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, therefore wood was very expensive.
Greenland was discovered long ago. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while sailing west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his search, the Eskimo tribe was already living there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, then you might think that a treasure map was written behind the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although something was written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words written behind the Declaration of Independence were "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776." It appears upside down at the bottom of the text document.
While no one wrote on it, it is known that in its life, it remained rolled up for storing large parchment documents (measuring up to 24¬Ω inches by 29¬æ inches).
So, it's likely the notation was being counted as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
This was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked us in Southern France, the invasion was known as "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated Southern France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant large group of people who cooperate and work together as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," which means civil, Latin citizen, which means citizen, and citizen, which means city or city-state, and it also defines the shape of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations, implying a civilization's culture passing down knowledge through generations, a cultural footprint, and impartial dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - a single entity under the Articles of Confederation, along with the Congress.
Congress had no power to implement the settlement, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it depended on state officials, who were often inconsistent in enforcing all its acts.
It did not have any authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
Before amending the articles, unanimous consent from all the states is required, and the states harassed the central government so much that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest archipelago in the world!
Due to Japan being a group/cluster of islands, Japan is often known as an "archipelago" in terms of geographical conditions.
Taiwan's history began in the 15th century, when European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating changes in indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the King Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the King Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings are being reconstructed on the edges of the complex to give tourists an idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues even today.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size near the analog film era.
It is still in production today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio was inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, to some extent confusing, as it's 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, this format's aspect ratio (obtained by dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) have aspect ratios that are equal to or approximately estimated.
The widely publicized and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that, by placing a measure of order within an image, creates dynamism.
It suggests that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
Within the scope of investigation is European history, specifically the period when the Catholic Church became wealthy and powerful.
Despite differences in language and customs, Christianity bound the European states together for over a thousand years.
The scattered power affected everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to reduce poverty and suffering, and the Church's monetary wealth should be especially for this cause.
The central authority of the Church resided in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth compelled many people to question whether this doctrine would last or not.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off significant military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters, preventing any ship from entering any part of the sea, which created a danger even for neutral ships.
Since there was a limited reaction to this strategy, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing view among most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations expressed a desire to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America for a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents in his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each phase of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Along with this, there was an unstable era of provinces divided between each dynasty. This period was an era of three of the most famous kingdoms which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce battles took place between several chieftains vying for the throne.
The history of ancient China included one of the three bloodiest eras of empires, where thousands of people were killed in the magnificent palace in Xi'an to sit on the highest seat.
There are many social and political impacts, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, the change towards nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to any single ruler.
Besides this, after the revolution, all occupations were open to male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
This is for the army, and instead of ranking soldiers based on their class, it will now be based on their caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond this worldly life. He often went to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
That cave, which has survived through time, offers a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on a prominent peak in the mountains, north of Makka, the cave is completely different from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find, even if one knows it exists. Once inside the cave, it's complete isolation.
Above, a clear, beautiful sky and many surrounding mountains can be seen, but nothing else. Very little of the world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures built in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau in the Valley of Egypt, or the "Giza Necropolis," includes numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "above arc" symbol looks like a V, and the "below arc" symbol looks like a staple or a square that disappears towards the bottom.
The above means you should start with the tip and push the bow, and the below means you should start with the frog (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bow generally produces a softer, more gentle sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to pencil in your own markings, but remember that the printed bowing marks are there for a musical reason, and should generally be respected.
A frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, along with their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced by a mob of market women to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
In a carriage, he returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their car open.
In Versailles, a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard who had been killed in front of a terrified queen at one point.
In the Philippines' victory, the war expenses of American imperialism were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
His American colonial administration compelled them to pay taxes in order to cover a large portion of expenses and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government through his Wall Street banking house.
Undoubtedly, the super profits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the core profit of US imperialism.
To understand the Templar, one must understand the context that inspired the creation of the order.
The era in which events occurred in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD) is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages.
The High Middle Ages came before the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
The main meaning of advancing technology or technological imperative is that humans are learning from the inherent logic associated with the scientific laws of destiny and their expression in technology. Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas in practice.
The most widespread interpretations of technology share two common ideas: that technological development follows a single path, distinct from cultural or political influences, and that technology, in turn, has "impacts" on underlying societies rather than being socially conditioned.
One could say, for example, that motor cars contribute to the development of necessary roads.
However, a nationwide road network only marginally helps Karman economically, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Car owners are frequently involved in accidents on the roads, leading to the invention of new technologies in healthcare for broken items.
Romanticism contained a significant element of cultural determinism, which was taken from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and over time, customs and cultures arise related to that geography, and these, because they are in accordance with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe, just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world.
Due to its comfort, its popularity lasted until almost 1100 AD, having started around 400 AD.
Its position declined largely from the twelfth century onwards due to the fact that Crusaders were returning with gifts like silk and spices that were more expensive than the prices in the Byzantine markets.
This was the time when the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the attire was significantly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, Shailiman in the west may be 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest events of that time, the Crusades, resulted in people starting to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is that agriculture which is done only to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses saved seeds along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, combined with ecoregions, to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be specific due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that specifically define a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through specific and symbolic uses of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw attention to some unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults while they were growing up, whether through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, these children were abandoned by parents due to their rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
There are allegations about others that they kept animals. Some are said to have lived alone in the forest.
When brought up completely by non-human animals, feral children displayed behavior (within physical limitations) almost entirely characteristic of their care-animal, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not just a method of learning, but a form of support that helps individuals going through a new learning experience, like using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds have been internally designed in the software and they are for questioning, prompting, and explaining processes that a student may find challenging to handle alone.
This can be used in mathematics to demonstrate and practice problem-solving in front of the whole class.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that lacks nutrition, care, and education, but they do.
We see foster care as a safe zone for children.
Providing care and upbringing, they are expected to fulfill all the needs that were lacking in their home, which they experienced before.
Providing care and nurturing, they are expected to fulfill all the needs that were lacking in their home, which they had previously experienced.
The internet combines elements of both interpersonal communication and commodities.
The use of internet features and experienced perspectives is being adopted in other dimensions as well.
"Learning" and "socialization" are suggested as key motivations for internet use, for example (James et al. 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" were also identified as newly inspired aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience responses on websites.
Video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of subtle expressions and facial movements that last for only milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying or not by accurately interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper "The President's Speech," indicated that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess honesty.
They also suggested that such capacities for explaining human behavior might be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has revealed that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
With each generation, separation and recombination of the two gene pools creates shifting variation.
Outside the savanna, it is difficult for primates with human-like digestive systems to meet their essential amino acid requirements from the plant resources available to them.
Besides this, failure in such circumstances has serious consequences: developmental delays, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest accessible plant-based resource is protein available in leaves and fruits, but for primates like us, they are difficult to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also provide a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Considering all the facts, we shouldn't be surprised that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" to some extent in much the same way as chimpanzees do today on the savanna.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and going back to sleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
Using a relatively quiet alarm clock to awaken yourself into consciousness, without jarring yourself awake, can be easily done.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, which forces the person to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace in a person is inversely related to the level of stress in their body and soul.
The less stress you have, the more positive your life force will be. Every person has the capacity to find complete peace and contentment.
Every person can attain self-realization. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
If you stop seeing everything else in your peripheral vision, or you don't see enough movement, then staring at a single point can effectively be the same problem.
Tibetan meditation centers on deity yoga. Through visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and self-awareness consciousness is built.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the countries drifted apart due to clashes in systems, processes, and cultures.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
This was to last for the next 40 years and, in reality, would be fought by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize, along with the Romanian Bridgehead.
This quickly rendered many plans obsolete, after more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and established Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts in the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for cargo transportation to carry people and goods in large quantities across oceans is still the most efficient method.
Navies traditionally ensure their country maintains the capability to move its people and goods, while also interfering with the ability of their enemies to move their people and goods.
A most notable recent example of this was the WWII North Atlantic campaign. The US tried to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using U-boats, was trying to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allied nations fail, then Germany would likely be able to defeat Britain, just as it had the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to their milk, wool, meat, and even hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often accompanied by a more widely known shepherd, who was often a child or adolescent. These animal husbandry practices are still in use today.
Wagonways were built in England in the 16th century.
Originally, wagons only consisted of parallel wooden planks, which allowed their horses to gain more speed and pull more weight compared to the slightly rougher roads of the day.
Cross ties were started quite early to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was felt that if there was an iron strip on top, the track would be more efficient.
This became a common occurrence, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rail was introduced.
The earliest known form of transportation persisted, as humans began walking upright around two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
They did not walk as upright as their predecessors, the Australopithecus.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living an environmentally friendly life, we can join the environmental movement, and we can also be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems, and we must neutralize it.
It is clear that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and problems have increased due to the larger population and the extraordinary lifestyles of mankind.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, a few blocks away.
Around 150 to 200 copies were made at night, which are now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8th in the yard of Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who was lecturing his soldiers in New York on July 9th. Another arrived in London on August 10th.
25 Dunlop broadsides still exist, which are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't understand them to be dinosaurs because they had feathers and they could fly.
However, there are many things about birds that still make them look like dinosaurs.
They have clawed feet and paws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Today, almost all computers in use are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits ‚Äì or bits ‚Äì for use in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are common enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be open containers of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the word bug in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This species has long been associated with ticks, and is adapted to parasitize humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs are both *Needicolous*, meaning they are adapted to live in the nests or homes of their hosts.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple can decide whether raising a child is in their best interest or not in the best interest of their child.
These couples can choose to plan to adopt children for themselves.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method truly guides most scientific research.
It's not just about luck; experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more potential hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas were accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
As the knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production via biological clocks.
Circadian rhythms, which are not merely a reaction to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are oscillators that maintain themselves and keep the duration of free-running cycling going, even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the major pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to transplant their own DNA into a bacterium.
He conducted two experiments, labeling either the DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the protein with radioactive sulfur in each phase.
Depending on the type of mutation, mutations can have different effects, depending on the importance of the affected pieces of genetic material and whether the affected cells are germline cells or not.
Mutations in the germ-line cells alone can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the scenery, including flora, fauna, and wildlife.
Examples of activities on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
Take an example, go to Borneo to learn and photograph about Orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small towns in cars to go to their workplaces and pass others whose work destinations are the places they just left.
This dynamic transport shuttle is connected in some way to everyone and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you probably rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transportation systems create such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, the driver is behaving within reasonably consistent limits; thus, there is some reasonable stability in the traffic stream and it can be represented mathematically to a large extent.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
I help with the planning, design, and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
It provides them with a wide range of small places to hide from hunters.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought that this was correct, but many people believed the opposite, that the solar system revolved around the Earth, which included the Sun (and even other stars).
This one seems smart, why doesn't Earth feel like it's spinning, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It holds 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
20 percent of the water flowing from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their form and in the excellence of their construction techniques.
The New Kingdom Egyptians marveled at the monuments of their predecessors from a thousand years before, which was more ancient than any other time.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is also an everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because these can all be found in their natural state and are relatively simple to work with using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This substance existed in four states (in the same order): solid, gas, and plasma, although they also theorized that it could transform and not remain in a new substance.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
You may have alloys that also contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
In this way, the pencil was a good companion for many people when it came out.
It is a matter of regret that as new methods of writing have emerged, the status and use of pencils have diminished.
People now write messages on computer screens, never having to come near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will happen to keyboards when something new comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to hold a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
Like a heavy vehicle rolling down a hill, splitting an atom again releases some of the energy within it.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they readily and spontaneously disintegrate.
The moon's surface is made of dust from rocks. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
It is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thin below Maria and thick below the highlands.
The area nearby might have more Maria because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory focuses on identifying what attracts people and what they find appealing.
This principle reveals that some people have certain needs and desires that are internalized and take shape as they mature into adulthood.
This theory examines what it is about certain people that motivates them to want what they want, and what aspects of their environment inspire them to do some things and not do others.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when a manager starts leading their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is people trying to remain "one of the guys (or girls)."
Managers of this type have difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a stranger is transformed who feels that he must change everything that the team is doing and make it his own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often results from a rift between leaders and the remaining team members.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often act as points of contact for their immediate physical group.
Compared to members of a traditional team, they have greater autonomy because they can meet according to different time zones, which Oman's management may not understand.
The presence of a well-defined team (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The ideal team management is the team to whom each member reports.
Why should an organization go through a response from the time of establishment of an educational organization? A goal to put organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When an organization effectively utilizes all available resources across its functional departments, it can foster communication of creativity and simplicity.
Consequently, an organization's response involves working together to overcome an obstacle, which may be a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before any organization can be innovative, leadership must build a culture of innovation along with shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that can be used to help organizations reach higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to the investigation of cognition, thereby narrowing the research field and making it more precise.
Neuroscience helps scientists in their research to understand the relationship between brain pathology and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, strokes, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technology allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes in ways we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building a simulation model, which helps us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong sense of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in machines.
AI in research involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose customer issues and answer questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate subjects, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being built into many home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher prefers to take their students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology provides solutions with virtual field trips. Students can sit together in their classrooms and view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, and appreciate beautiful art.
In fact, sharing a field trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state's capital; the website is redesigned every year, but older versions are kept online to serve as scrapbooks.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most important audience, bloggers start trying to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging compels students to become more aware of the world around them. The need to engage the audience encourages students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn even beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to internet content, students can define their position in relation to the writing of others and also highlight their own perspective on specific issues (Orewijk, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and features a series of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
In the far south, it has Niagara Falls, and in the north, it is home to Muskoka and its further untouched natural beauty.
These things and Ontario are best highlighted as Canadian by outsiders.
Further north, large areas are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited forests.
What surprises people when comparing populations: There are more African Americans living in America than there are citizens of Canada.
East African islands are in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is the largest and a continent in itself.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are connected to France and are known for luxury beach resorts.
The people of Arab countries also brought Islam to the ground, and it massively seized control in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism started in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, this region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female passenger say she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can also be helpful (not just one that looks very expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in how they perceive harassment, and that stalking, holding hands, etc., are not uncommon.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences do not justify it).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Baida and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It's easy to find places near the old medina that sell traditional Moroccan goods, like tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and the entire spectrum of gaudy items, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located near the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, close to Rwanda.
Mount Nyiragongo's lava destroyed Goma in 2002, burying the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is safe, one must explore traveling outside of Goma to understand the ongoing fighting situation in the North Kivu province.
This city serves as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, with some of the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
For short trips, the typical (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs. You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma.
With its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for foreign, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sand.
During Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World, it was one of the major stops.
This city is quite different from the rest of the country's cities, because it has more of an Arabian feel than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, runs along the border of Zimbabwe to the north, and has the Crocodile River as its southern border.
The park is spread over 19,500 sq km and divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
This is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
Buying a Wild Card can be beneficial for anyone, as it grants entry to South Africa or any one park of their choice from all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong region and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
Hong Kong's skyline, with its parade of buildings, has been compared to a magnificent bar chart, made all the more vivid by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
The urban development of Hong Kong Island is mostly densely packed along the northern coast, on reclaimed land.
This is the place where the British colonialists settled, and therefore, if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending from the coast up to 80 km (50 miles) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarban National Park.
Although the forest isn't just mangrove swamp - it includes some of the last remaining stands of mighty forest that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 sq km, of which about one-third consists of water/swampy areas.
Since 1966, Sundarban has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that the area now has 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses are available throughout the day from the Inter-District Bus Station (across the river), although most, especially those going towards Purba and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
In most districts, small Japanese coaster buses operate, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance below the culvert is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be abolished.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group who now live in eastern Paraguay as semi-nomadic hunters who also practice subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco area was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycur√∫ and Payagu√°, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," was born from the encounter of Spanish conquerors with native indigenous groups.
The Spanish people started the colonial period which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for being the world's best polo team and for its players.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Canitas polo field.
Small tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and polo match tickets, you need to buy them from somewhere; you should check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP) at a value of one to one.
Money can only be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located at Stanley's from FIC West Store.
British Pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and United States Dollars are also often accepted within Stanley.
Credit cards are rarely accepted on the outer islands, although British and United States currency can be carried; ask the owners in advance to find out what payment methods are acceptable.
Exchanging Falkland currency outside the islands is nearly impossible, so it is necessary to exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it experiences summer when the Northern Hemisphere experiences winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30¬∞C are normal.
The cold can be deceptively bitter: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer reads.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons; the amount of rainfall is almost the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park may be accustomed to seeing humans, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, one should stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
It doesn't matter how gentle they seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack us.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't stay at a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so let them be in their place.
Also, be aware that the smell attracts skunks and other wildlife, so avoid taking or cooking odorous food items, and maintain a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is on the island of Upolu and its population is just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the site of a notorious naval standoff when seven ships from Germany, America, and Britain refused to leave the port.
Except for one British cruiser, all the ships sank. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the assassination of paramount chief Tupu'a Tamasese Lealofi III.
It is most popular in three regions. Because of the angle of inclination of the Auckland arm of the two ports, there are many beaches.
The northern coastline (in the North Harbour district) faces the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
It is a sheltered haven, with almost all parts having a gentle coastline, and mostly shaded by Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive is a coastal road in central Auckland, on the Waitemata Harbour, passing Mission Bay and the expensive suburbs of St Heliers.
This sometimes becomes a crowded family beach with shops lined up along the shore. But you are safe here.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but rather pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you are worried, bottled water is easy to find.
The concept of a "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians. A short black "espresso" comes with cappuccino cream (without foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate conforms to Belgian standards. Fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Reef trips are made many times throughout the year, and injuries on the reef from any cause are rare.
Even so, consult with officials, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found in the north from 1770, near beaches and river mouths from October to April. They can sometimes be found outside of this period as well.
Sharks are present, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not actively found in the sea; their primary habitat is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives passengers peace of mind knowing they will have accommodation upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping grounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
If you need time to think about the proposal or to obtain other documents (such as a visa) for your destination, they can put your reservation on hold for some time.
However, any amendments or requests should be made through the travel agent rather than directly with the hotel.
For some festivals and music concerts, a vast majority of attendees decide to camp on site, and most consider the experience to be a significant part of it.
If you want to be close to that event, you'll have to go early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the main stage might have finished the music, there could be some parts of the festival where music continues late into the night.
During some festivals, there are special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic in the winter, check the cabin space, because the passage of ice makes a quite terrifying noise for those who are very affected by it.
St. Petersburg shore excursions include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos typically make many attempts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
To keep the guests in a good mood and to keep them engaged in the premises, they usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment options available.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are served. However, alcohol impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of remaining calm.
Those who ever drive to high altitudes or mountains should consider the possibility of snow or cold temperatures.
Icy and snowy roads have less friction, and you can't drive them the same way you drive on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to trap you.
Visibility may be restricted due to snow falling, blowing, or condensation/ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic generally flows smoothly throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and an attraction for many visitors.
In popular usage, the word safari refers to a journey, especially an overland trip to observe spectacular African wildlife in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, come close to the cars, and standard equipment allows for a good view.
Lions, tigers, and leopards can sometimes be shy, and you might see them better through binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") involves a long hike, either for a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the games in 1964, will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, it could be a difficult situation for you.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-based cancellation policies were not extended past July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled, until the end of March.
It is expected that most event ticket prices will be between ¬•2,500 and ¬•130,000, with specific tickets priced around ¬•7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available on loan, even if there isn't one in the room.
If iron is not available, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer if it is available.
Be careful not to let the clothes get too hot (as this can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, scorching).
There are various ways to purify water, some being more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while others require several minutes.
Filter effectiveness varies, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may face animals and insects that they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or even worse, trigger allergies, spread poison, or spread infections.
Contagious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that forcefully injure or kill people, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to shop at designated locations and purchase goods exempt from excise duties.
Travelers bound for countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save significant amounts of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated backwoods terrain.
If you're not used to driving on this country's roads, be aware of yourself: steep grades, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are prevalent.
The posted speed limit is significantly lower than in the preceding and subsequent sections ‚Äì typically 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) ‚Äì and strict adherence to it is even more crucial than otherwise.
The funny thing is, though, the mobile phone service is much stronger here compared to many other parts of the trail, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is very good and in Bavaria, similar to its southern neighbor Austria, it is quite rich and varied.
Fruit pastries are common, apples are baked in pastries year-round, and cherries and plums make their appearance during the summer.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on meat or vegetables, with herbs and spices.
Based on the amount of liquid, a curry can be either "dry" or "wet."
In Northern India and inland Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Encompassing over 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that includes a vast array of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, if used without a preceding qualifier, the word refers primarily to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a range of simply seasoned dishes, with key flavors of peanut, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various fragrant spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the ride, but safety concerns may arise due to the possibility of riders' feet getting trapped.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they are at risk of being dragged if the horse starts to run. To reduce this risk, several safety precautions are taken.
