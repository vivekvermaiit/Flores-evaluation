This doesn't just confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a very widespread theory, but it also provides details that fossils generally don't offer, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid on the underside.
The discovery provides an explanation for the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers don't have an important and complete evolutionary series, called the rachis, but they do have other feather characteristics - like barbs and barbules - and researchers found that the rachis was likely an evolutionary innovation that came after these other characteristics.
The composition of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flying but for regulating temperature. Researchers suggested that even though this is a small dinosaur's fluff, the sample shows feathers of large birds, not chicks.

The Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, gave the judgment of Huhne and Pryce this morning.
Hohne has resigned and he will be replaced in the cabinet by MP Ed Davey. It is expected that MP Norman Lamb will take the Business Secretary position that Davey will vacate.
Huwon and Bryce will attend Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16th.
Nicolas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Kodback, 21 years old, are the ones who died. Kodback was driving.
Edgar Figueroa sustained injuries to the arm and jaw, while Christopher Schneider required reconstructive surgery to his face.
Oka's weapon malfunctioned when he aimed directly at the fifth guy's head. Schneider has constant pain, is blind in one eye, has a piece of his skull missing, and his face is made of titanium.
Schneider presented his testimony via a video link from a US Air Force base in his country.
After the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo competed in two individual races in the championship.
The first race I participated in was a slalom ski race, and the result was "Did not finish" in the first run. 36 out of 116 people got the same result in this race.
The last race I participated in was the giant slalom skiing race, and I came in tenth place in the women's sitting group. My total run time was 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes less than the time of the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who came in first place, and 1:09.02 minutes more than the Hungarian Gy√∂ngyi Dani, who came in ninth place.
Four female skiers in the disabled team were unable to complete their round, and 45 out of 117 female skiers in the giant slalom race were unable to take a place in the race.
The police returned Madhia Pradesh's PC and laptop that were stolen.
Deputy Inspector General Dr. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Rambo Kanjar, Ghaza Kamjar, and Vishu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused were brought to court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision happened is temporarily closed while emergency services rescue the man from inside the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has appeared in the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh charged with killing her son.
She is under arrest and awaiting charges and trial, but it's possible that some of the witness evidence has been tainted because her picture has been widely published.
This is a widespread practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and the courts have considered that publishing photos can be biased, favoring one side over another.
Professor Pamela Ferguson said that "journalists are at risk when they publish pictures or anything about suspects."
The press office, generally responsible for claims to journalists, said that there would be no further comments until after the indictment at least.
The leak says the document contains the border dispute that Palestine wants based on the borders that existed before the Middle East war of 1967.
Among the topics that were addressed are the future of Jerusalem, which is considered a holy city for both peoples, and the discussion of the Jordan Valley.
It demands that Israel maintain a military presence in the valley for ten years, as soon as an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to the continuation of this presence for five years.
The forest rangers had to monitor the shooters who were the supplementary experiment for pest control, which was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between "The National Parks and Wildlife Service" and "The Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia," qualified volunteers are selected within the association's hunting program.
According to what Mick O‚ÄôFlynn, acting director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), said, the four hunters who were chosen to carry out the first hunt were given all the safety guidelines and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of 9 members.
It's the fifth temporary electoral council of Martil in four years.
The electoral commission said last month that the resignation of the interim electoral council is part of the steps that will push the country towards new elections.
The formation of the committee is Martelly's response to the spread of anti-regime demonstrations that began in October.
The failure to properly manage the elections is what caused the protests, which sometimes include violence, by some of the people from 2011.
People are reporting about 60 cases where there was a problem of the "iPod's" temperature increasing, and this was the cause of approximately six fires and four people sustaining minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry stated that Apple informed them of 34 additional active incidents that the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded and said that the delay of Apple's report is "very unfortunate."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The emergency office in the Northern Marianas said there were no casualties.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no indications of a tsunami occurring.
An old Filipino police officer held tourists from Hong Kong hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza hit the tourists with his M16 rifle.
A few hostages were rescued, and at least six people have died so far.
Six hostages, including young children and elderly people, were released early, as well as the Filipino photographers.
They took the old woman's spot while she went to the toilet. Things got heated in Mendoza.
He followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and then started working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital (l'h√¥pital), LiGenz started investigating the problem of premature birth in his free time.
And he showed through his research that when a certain hormone is given, it will accelerate lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua said that government investigators found two black boxes of the flight recorder on the day of the accident.
Even the wrestlers who were with them praised Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was an awesome wrestler. And that my manager Luna died on a night as unique as she and her mother were."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented and said: "Luna was as eccentric as me... and maybe even more than me... I loved her and I'm going to miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of opponents to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those who participated in the survey share the same opinion, which is that they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Regarding the opposing opinions in the survey, 29% of the people who answered the survey think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, but 31% think that Australia should not be a republic at all.
To compete in the Olympics, he needed to excel in the 100m and 200m freestyle swimming events across three stages to win a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games, but due to complaints, there were doubts about his physical fitness.
He couldn't take the medication he needs to stop feeling the pain because it's prohibited in sports.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Many people verified the discovery with different devices and software at the beginning of February, and it will be announced on Tuesday.
Perhaps comets are a source of delivering water to Earth, along with organic materials that could be proteins and support life.
Since comets started colliding with Earth, scientists have been trying to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed.
Como, 53 years old, began his term earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He said about the rumors that they are "political babble and empty talk."
It seems like he's going to run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration said that NextGen is a system that will allow airplanes to fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and stop carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike the old technology that uses ground-based radar, to allow air traffic controllers to determine the aircraft's location with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more specific information.
The price of the tramway and above-ground trains won't increase, and they won't stop at Wembley, and there are no parking spaces above ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation have led to the possibility of the match being played behind closed doors, without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science said that a new species of bird is evolving in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden said that the new species evolved non-abruptly over generations, even though this process takes longer due to interbreeding between the resident Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be formed into various shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire and can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can become very thin and stick to another metal. And it can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical substance. You can make an indicator using purple cabbage juice.
Lettuce juice changes its color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical compound.
The acidity level is determined by the proportion of hydrogen ions (which is H in pH) in the substance undergoing chemical testing.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the breadcrumbs together and, with wet hands, form them into a ball.
The humidity in your hand will react with the outer layers, creating a pleasant sensation and forming something resembling small shells.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had bathrooms with flush toilets in every house, connected to a complex drainage system.
They found remnants of sewage systems in the homes of Minoan and Santorini cities in Greece.
Toilets existed even in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Toilets in the Roman civilization were in public bathhouses where men and women mixed.
In order to contact someone who is thousands of kilometers away from you, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and instantly returns it.
A rocket is what sent the satellite to space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light and our vision.
It takes a large rocket, with a height of over 100 feet, to put a satellite or telescope into space.
This is because the electricity coming to the socket, where that metal part from the bulb is, can cause you a strong electric shock if you touch the inside part of the socket or the metal base of the bulb while it's still slightly attached to the socket.
He brought us the train, the car, and many other transportation devices.
The ones below her (smaller than her) are the medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey like rabbits, gazelles, and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
That positioning is the characteristic that gives them the secret to success, and it's where the catch is: they're in a place far from competition with others.
Lions are the most social cats because they live in groups called prides.
A lion pride consists of three males who are related, and about thirty females and cubs.
The girls are always close to each other, and they're a big family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave like packs of wolves and dogs; these animals resemble lions (but not like other big cats) in behavior and are highly predatory towards their prey.
The tiger, considering it's a versatile athlete, can climb (even if not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The leopard is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, tigers, and jaguars.
These four cats are the only ones that can roar. The tiger's roar isn't like the lion's roar with a complete sound, but it's like a few words (an incomplete sentence) with a howl (like a cat) but roaring.
The ocelot eats small animals. It catches monkeys, mongooses, rodents, and birds if it can. The animals that the ocelot hunts are almost all smaller than it.
Scientists believe that the ocelot tracks and finds the animals it will eat (prey) by scent, and can smell where they have been on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and also move around stealthily well. Pygmy tigers hunt their prey by blending in with them before pouncing on the prey.
When a small group of living organisms separates from its original species (for example, if they move across mountains, a valley, or go to an island from which they cannot return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different features or modifications in their housing compared to what they had before in order to become a strong competitor.
The original people haven't changed at all, they need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, and as new residents begin to adapt to their new environment, they start to look like the other residents.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will be so different that we won't be able to say they are of the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. And speciation is a process we can't escape, and it's a very essential part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe into their lungs and take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (breathe out).
Potatoes feed from the sun using photosynthesis, and they even provide shade.
We build our houses with plants, we make our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is also plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
The mosasaurus was the strongest predator of its time and feared nothing except others of its kind.
Its long jaws were studded with over 70 teeth resembling razors, plus another set on the roof of its mouth, which meant nothing could escape if it got in its way.
We're not sure, but apparently he had a forked tongue and only ate turtles, big fish, and some other fish, and apparently he even ate human flesh.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex couldn't handle it.
Although many Roman foods might be familiar to us, they have some strange and unusual things for the feast, like wild boar, peacock, dormice, and a type of field mouse called "glis glis".
Another difference is that when the poor and women ate food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have feasts with each other and ate their food while reclining on their sides.
Ancient Roman meals wouldn't have included any of the types of food that came to Europe from America or Asia in the centuries that followed.
For example, they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no one from the ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built temples for their gods as a primary place of worship, which was considered the god's home.
People can bring offerings to the gods, and the priests fulfill the needs of the gods in festivals and holidays.
Each temple has an open courtyard that leads to a secluded inner sanctum, which only the priests can enter.
Some pyramids have a special shape, like towers, called ziggurats, and they were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was the god's safe haven.
In the warm Middle Eastern climate, having a house isn't that important.
Most of the Jews' lives were spent outside their homes.
The women were cooking in the garden; the shops had just opened across the street, and they were using stone in the construction.
Wood was expensive in Canada because there weren't big forests there.
Humans inhabited Greenland sparsely. It is said in Scandinavian sagas that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it that way.
Regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were living there previously.
Even though all the countries were Scandinavian, there were still big differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you'd say that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not right. Even if there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
It was written on the back of the Independence Document "The Original Independence Document, July 4th, 1776." The writing is at the bottom of the paper, upside down.
No one is sure who wrote it; the large manuscript document (measuring 29¬æ inches by 24¬Ω inches) was covered for storage from a long time ago.
Often, the symbol is added to act as a sign/marker.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but not the south.
She was governed by the French "Vichy" regime. These are the French who made peace with Germany in 1940 and worked with the colonizers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies entered southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
Civilization is a shared individual culture among a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis," which means "civil" and is related to the Latin "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state." Furthermore, this somehow defines the size of the society.
Self-governing cities are like the ancestors of nations. Civilizational culture implicitly means the transmission of knowledge across many generations, and a cultural imprint that remains, and the dissemination of knowledge in a fair manner.
Small civilizations often disappear without leaving behind clear archaeological traces and fail to be considered as distinct civilizations.
When the Revolutionary War was happening, the original thirteen states formed a weak central government - with Congress being its sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
In addition, she doesn't have the authority to bypass the tax laws and tariffs that exist between states.
The laws required everyone's approval from all states before they could be agreed upon, and the states disregarded the central administration because their representatives were absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the popular sports, there are football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Sports are very popular in the northern regions where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has approximately 7000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes it the seventh-largest island country in the world.
Due to the cluster/grouping of the Japanese islands, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical perspective, as a single "archipelago."
Taiwan's history began in the 15th century when European sailors started passing by an island called Formosa, which is a beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began changing native grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work in rice and sugar farms.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty's armies (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province subordinate to the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War between 1894 and 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the Agdal gardens were renovated to give tourists a glimpse of what they originally looked like.
And when the year 1976 arrived, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and restoration work has continued until today.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
Its production is still ongoing until today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio of images was inherited by the image sensor array in digital cameras.
Size 35mm is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
That's why it is said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to find the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many formats (like APS for example) are almost equal to or close to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often misused and constantly mocked, is a guiding principle that creates dynamism and maintains order in a picture.
He says that the most impactful location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was subjected to scrutiny during this period of European history.
Christianity kept European countries united for over a thousand years, despite differences in language and customs.
The comprehensive power she had influenced everything, from the King to the general public.
Among the church's beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that financial support for the church is managed for this purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been upheld.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy is working well, the blockade of supplies for the military and civilians, even though this siege violates a universally accepted law in many agreements in these past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sections of the ocean, which has created danger even for neutral ships.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipates a similar reaction to the unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the popular stances among most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, countries desired to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to work with the Edison company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a different way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each family that was in power was considered a distinct dynasty.
Similarly, between each dynasty there was an unstable period for the divided provinces. One of the most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
A fierce war broke out during this period between many nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died or were fighting to sit on the highest throne in the grand palace in the city of Xi'an.
There are many social and political impacts of the Qaed system, a shift from an absolute and national republic to the idea that the people own the country, not the ruler.
Similarly, after the revolution, all jobs were open to all males, and this allowed people with more ambition and a desire for success to succeed.
And the same goes for the military, who are no longer being ranked by grade (or rank), but rather by connections (or influence).
The French Revolution inspired some oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolution.
Mohamed was interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He used to go and meditate in a cave called "Hira" on Mount "An-Nur" (The Light).
The cave itself, which has endured throughout the ages, offers a very vivid image of the Prophet Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca is completely isolated from the world.
In reality, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Just entering the cave, you become completely isolated.
Nothing is visible except the beautiful, clear sky and the surrounding mountains. Only a small part of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one remaining of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World today.
The Great Pyramid, which the Egyptians built in the 3rd century BC, is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
It's located in the Giza Plateau, or the "Tombs of Giza," which in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, has many pyramids (including the Great Pyramid, which is the largest), some tombs, some temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family.
The "reaching the arc" symbol looks like a V, or the "bottom of the arc" symbol looks like a fundamental piece or a square with its bottom side missing.
" ÿ∑ŸÑŸëÿπ" means you need to put the head (of the bow) and push the bow of the violin upwards. "Ÿáÿ®ŸëŸéÿ∑" means you need to put the lower part of the bow and pull downwards.
Usually, the bow on top produces a higher-pitched sound, but the bow on the bottom is stronger and firmer.
Don't hesitate to draw your own markings with a pencil, but be aware that the curved printed markings exist for a musical reason, that's why they should be respected.
King Louis XV, Queen Marie Antoinette, their young children (Marie Therese, 11 years old, and Louis Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were brought back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789 by a group of vulgar women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a large crowd of people who were shouting and chanting against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the car windows.
Once upon a time, a member of the gang beheaded a member of the royal guard, killing him in Versailles in front of the Queen who was terrified.
However, soon a new invention will arrive, which will usher in a period of cultural advancement in the Scandinavian countries, the Bronze Age.
The Filipino people paid for the costs of the American imperialist war in the invasion of the Philippines themselves. They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime in order to bear a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds that were floated in the name of the Philippine government through the role of banks in Wall Street.
Of course, the huge profits resulting from the exploitation of the Filipino people are the primary gains of American imperialism.
In the late Middle Ages, Europe began to develop itself, and among the biggest things that developed at that time as a result of the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
The era in which the events took place is referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is known to end around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the promotion of technology or technological necessity to a strong feeling that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic linked to the laws of science and their manifestations in technology.
Most explanations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path that transcends cultural and political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are more hereditary in nature than socially constructed.
For example, someone might say that the car engine necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, building a road network spanning the entire country doesn't have economic justification for the few cars there are, that's why new roads are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The large number of cars leads to a rise in the accident rate, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the medical field to treat injured bodies.
In the Romantic movement, there were many elements of cultural determinism drawn from books by authors like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture connected to that geography emerged. These, being consistent with the place of the community, were better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Paris is famous for being the fashion capital of the contemporary world, while Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is famous for being a center of luxury from 400 AD and its fame continued until 1100 AD.
Her status declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusades returned carrying gifts like silk and spices, which held greater value than what the Byzantine markets were offering.
And at this time, the title of fashion capital was given to Paris, replacing Constantinople.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th or 11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
Even so, considering the slow communication channels, trends can be delayed in the West by approximately 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Europe began to develop itself, and among the biggest things that developed at that time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to close clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is the type of agriculture that aims to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family alone.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, often organic, that uses native, saved seeds from the local environment along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The things that characterize a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Often, members of a subculture distinguish themselves by using a distinctive and symbolic style that can be in dress, behavior, and dialect.
Among the ways that demonstrate the importance of socialization, we can see the cases of children who suffered from neglect, poverty, or deliberate abuse, and who were not integrated into society by adults as they were growing up.
These children are called "feral," and some feral children have been previously confined by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Wild children may have been subjected to abuse and severe trauma in early childhood before being abandoned or running away.
And it's said that others were raised by animals; and some grew up on their own in the wilderness.
When the boy from the forest is raised by animals, the boy exhibits some behaviors (within his physical capabilities) that are very similar to the behaviors of a pet animal, for example his fear of humans or his indifference towards them.
While project-based learning should facilitate the learning process and make it enjoyable, scaffolding techniques enhance it.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but it provides assistance to individuals who are embarking on a new learning experience, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
Scaffolding techniques can be virtual or in-person, and alternatively, the professor or the pages in Microsoft Office can act as a kind of scaffold.
The virtual supports for education were implemented in a software that poses questions, corrects, and explains steps that might be difficult for the student to do alone.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment that doesn't provide them with nutrition, care, and education, but there are those who grow up in such environments.
We understand that the orphanage is the safe place for these kids.
Our kafala system needs to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and accredited health coverage.
Alternative care must provide all the necessities that they lacked in the homes they left previously.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet have brought added dimensions regarding the approach of uses and gratifications.
For example, some suggest "learning" and "socialization" as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Ighmhi and McCord (1998) defined "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as motivational aspects in their analysis of audience interaction with websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions or facial movements that last for a few fractions of a second.
It is said, in particular, that one can discover if someone is lying by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
In his research paper titled "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks stated that people who are unable to understand the speech due to a brain defect are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
Rather, he proposes the idea that these abilities in analyzing human behavior might be shared with some animals, like pet dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: one hidden and one visible.
Mutation increases new genetic diversity, and selection removes it from the species' gene pool.
Discrimination and reintegration reshape the diversity between both groups in every generation.
In the savanna forests, it is difficult for a monkey with the same digestive system as a human to meet its amino acid needs by eating the grasses that are available there.
And furthermore, failure in doing this has serious consequences: reduced growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
Sources of protein that are available are found in leafy greens and vegetables, but it's difficult for primates like us to digest them until they are cooked.
On the contrary, animal-based foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide high amounts of protein and contain all the essential amino acids.
Taking everything into consideration, we shouldn't be surprised if one of our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way similar to how chimpanzees do it in the savanna.
Hitting the wake-up call means someone wakes up during their usual sleep time and then goes back to sleep after a short period (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a gentle/gradual alarm that wakes you up without startling you awake.
If you find yourself constantly checking the time while you're asleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Among other possible biological options, there's drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, or any fluid that makes you urinate) before sleeping, so that the person wakes up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force. Anyone has the ability to find peace and absolute contentment.
Everyone is capable of reaching enlightenment. The only thing that hinders us on the path to this goal is our stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism relies on the teachings of Buddha, but it expanded/spread through the Mahayana path with love, or rather, with many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path of love that embraces everyone.
Kundalini yoga awakens the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) by using yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan Meditation Center is Deity Yoga. Through visualizing different deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened awareness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and America. However, with the end of the war, the clash of systems, procedures, and cultures resulted in a conflict between the two countries.
Allies became enemies and the Cold War started two years after the war ended.
It could have lasted for the next 40 years, with the agency's armies fiercely fighting for it in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and other places.
And on September 17, 1939, the Polish defense fell, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
Despite all that, these plans became outdated overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army entered the Soviet Union and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland and violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Cargo ships are the most effective way to transport large quantities of goods and people across the oceans.
The navy's job was to ensure the movement of people and goods for your country, and at the same time, to interfere with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the clearest examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to transport their troops and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic using submarines mainly.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to invade Britain as they did in the rest of Europe.
It seems goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them, as they made it easier for them to find milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were raised in herds that grazed in thorny scrubland or other grazing areas, and they were often herded by shepherds who were usually young children or teenagers, like the widely known shepherd. And these grazing methods are still used to this day.
The warship was built in England at the beginning of the 16th century.
Even though the carts were only made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them, achieve greater speeds, and haul heavier loads than before on roads that were considered difficult at the time.
Railway tracks were invented relatively early on to stabilize the routes, but it later became apparent that a steel strip on top of the track made it more effective.
This has become a known practice, but the iron helped the wooden wheels to last longer/be more durable.
In the end, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first complete iron rails were introduced.
The primary mode of transportation was walking, and humans started walking upright about two million years ago when Homo erectus appeared.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, didn't walk upright as we are used to.
Bipedal species were found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live a life where we're more friendly with the environment, and we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce the suffering of the future a little bit.
This is exactly like treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we need to find the root cause of the problems, or we need to stop them.
It's clear enough that the world has changed a lot due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and the problems have become bigger due to population increase and people's luxurious lifestyles.
After the Congress approved it on July 4th, they sent a handwritten, signed copy by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson to John Dunlap's printing press, which was just a short distance away from them.
At night, they would usually print between 150 to 200 copies, and it's now known by the name "Metwassia Dunlop".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in Independence Square on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th and read to his troops on July 9th. A copy of it reached London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap prints that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten version wasn't saved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs lived and are still living today. We call them birds.
A lot of people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and fly.
But there are many things about birds that still make them look like dinosaurs.
They have feet/legs with scales or claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all used PCs today rely solely on manipulating information written in a binary numeral system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, meaning 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits, depending on the computer language.
Symptoms of internal poisoning might not appear immediately. An immediate diagnosis can't be made when general symptoms like vomiting appear.
The best indicator of internal poisoning might be finding an open container of medication or poisonous household chemicals.
Consult the label to learn about first aid instructions specific to the particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "bkhakhsh" to refer to this group of insects.
This term is derived from the old knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects that have adapted greatly to parasitize humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs are all characterized by nesting, and they can adapt to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout America, which is why it is considered the main neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Encephalitis is a disease that can affect the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to be at risk of multiple sclerosis.
The man and his wife can decide that it's not in their best interest or in the best interest of their son to raise a child.
This couple might choose to have their son adopted.
In the adoption process, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works by using the scientific method. This method is what guides scientific research.
Even so, she's not unique in this regard; experimentation and experience are considered a test that can be used to disprove a hypothesis or more. Asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient writings, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted for all scientific matters, and even for psychology.
At a time when Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have noticed that rhythms in physiology and behavior always rely on internal cycles and their production via the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic signals, have been observed in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that will persist for periods through successive cycles even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was among the proposals that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to inject their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to distinguish whether the DNA of the phage was involved, using radioactive phosphorus, or the protein of the phage, using radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the gene locus affected, and whether the cells affected are from a germline lineage.
A mutation that occurs in germline cells is what can be passed on to children; mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, plants, and wildlife.
It includes tips on activities that can be done on site, such as hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting the gardens, and studying information about the ecosystem.
Like for example visiting orangutans in Borneo, photographing them, and getting to know them.
People drive from small towns in their cars every morning to get to their workplaces, and they encounter other workers on the road who are coming from the place they just left.
In the sustainable transportation ecosystem, everyone supports and is somehow connected to a transportation system whose foundation is private cars.
Science now says that the large carbon economy has removed one of the stable states from the atmosphere that helped human civilization flourish in the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses transportation systems. Everyone complains about the transportation systems.
You rarely hear in developed countries levels like this of complaints about water quality or bridges that collapse.
Why do transportation systems cause so many complaints, and why don't they succeed every day? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something bigger than this?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and cars between two places and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, to study the flow of traffic, it's difficult because the behavior of drivers is impossible to predict with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave with a reasonable degree of consistency; because of this, traffic enjoys reasonable consistency, and can be expressed mathematically in an approximate way.
To have a smooth flow of traffic, combine these three things: 1. Flow 2. Density 3. And speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operations of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape from predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are able to fold their wings behind their backs.
This gives them a large number of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people used to think he was right, and many thought the opposite; they believed the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the Earth.
This seems logical because we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the amount of water that the second largest river carries.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, as its width sometimes reaches six miles.
20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,378 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Even though they continued building pyramids with stone until the Old Kingdom ended, the Giza pyramids have never been surpassed in terms of size and artistic distinction in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were already over a thousand years old at that time.
Vatican City has approximately 800 people, and it is the smallest independent city in the world and the one with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also a language of daily life used by most people who work for the Vatican City, while Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of Vatican City are all Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper for a long time because they are easy to extract from nature in their primary form using simple means.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also hypothesized that they transformed into new materials to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered minerals. And of course, there are also minerals like silver and gold.
It's possible to create alloys from non-metallic materials, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is created from matter. All materials are created from small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit in the space after this sentence.
Water is another example. Water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
Unfortunately, even though new ways of writing have appeared, the value and use of the pencil have decreased.
People who type messages on computer screens will never need a wood saw.
Can you imagine what my keyboard might turn into when something new appears?
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to bind the nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus that constantly splits, whether there is a slight disturbance or not.
The surface of the moon has rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust's thickness is around 70 kilometers on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
He is thin down by Maria and thick up by the highlands.
The tide will be high on the near side because the crust is thin there. It was easy for the lava to come up.
Content theories revolve around finding what excites or attracts people.
Many theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that are instilled in them as they grow and mature.
These theories explore what is unique about the people who do the things they do, and what aspects of their environment either enable or prevent them from doing those things.
Two content theories are known as Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two types of behavior can emerge when managers begin leading their peers, one of which is trying to remain "like the others" (or the other women).
This type of manager faces difficulty in making unusual decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, or holding people accountable.
On the contrary, a person transforms into someone unrecognizable and feels that they have to change everything the team was doing and keep it as their own possession.
And after everything, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often results in disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
When we're dealing with the various mechanisms that prevent a person from reaching their full potential, the first step to solving the problem is to find the root cause of the issue.
Usually, the team members who are online serve as a point of contact between them and the team that is on the ground.
They often enjoy greater autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a "hidden team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is a distinguishing component of a virtual team.
The "hidden team" is the management team that all members report to. The hidden team is the one that sets the standards for each member.
Why waste the organization's time creating a learning organization? Innovation is the goal of applying organizational learning concepts.
When all available resources are utilized effectively within the functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity become apparent.
As a result of that, cooperation within the organization can lead to overcoming obstacles and implementing innovative and new procedures that can meet the client's needs.
Before the organization can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuity approach as a method that institutions use to help them reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to researching perception. This narrows the scope of the research and makes it more precise.
The relationship between the pathology of the brain and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
The development of new technology helps us discover the structure and processes of the brain that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence is strongly associated with science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science, and it deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
Among the research in the field of artificial intelligence is the attempt to create machines that provide services that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include things like control, planning, scheduling, and the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, in addition to handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become like separate specializations, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have also been adopted in many PC software applications and home video games.
Field trips are considered a big part of any semester. Often, a teacher might want to take her students to places a bus can't reach.
Technology provides a solution through virtual field trips. Students can see artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or enjoy fine art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing the virtual tour's platform is a great way for someone to think about the tour and share their experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned every year, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a record.
You can also help blogs to improve students' writing. Even though students often start their blogging experience with all sorts of incorrect grammar and spelling, that all changes with an audience.
Since students are the audience that always criticizes the blogger, he tries to improve his writing skills to avoid criticism.
Also, blogs "allow students to have a greater knowledge of the world around them". Because the need to feed the public's interest inspires students to be excellent and useful (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that helps with collaboration and encourages students to expand the scope of learning beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs can "enable students to become more capable of analysis and critique; and through effective response to materials on the internet, students can determine their stance in relation to the writings of others, in addition to being able to determine their own opinions regarding certain specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada, it has two languages and many art galleries and museums that display Canada's past and present.
There are Niagara Falls in the far south, and in the north there's a beautiful house of nature that's not being exploited in M'souka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as being considered to have the essence of Canada for foreigners.
Most areas in the far north are sparsely populated, and some are almost completely uninhabited wilderness.
For the sake of comparison regarding population figures that astonish many: the number of African Americans living in the United States is greater than the entire population of Canada.
There are islands of Africa in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is considered the largest isolated continent when we talk about wildlife.
Most of the islands are independent nations or connected to France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
Just as Islam entered the country with the Arabs, and it grew significantly, exceeding the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
From the north, it is bordered by the African coast, and it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean from the south and west.
Women: Women who want to travel must say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's good to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to know that cultural differences can lead to things they might consider rude, and they shouldn't follow them or take them to heart, etc.
You need to be firm when you reject men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences don't mean that this behavior is acceptable!).
Amazigh fishermen are the ones who founded the new city of Casablanca in the 10th century BC, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it, then rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca (White House), and they left it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultans rebuilt the city and named it Casablanca, and the Spanish traders called it Casablanca, and they established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least exciting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Throughout the old city, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, like tagines, pottery, leather, shisha pipes, and a whole range of knick-knacks, but this is mainly for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the lava flow from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Even though it was a relatively peaceful Friday, all visits outside of Friday require investigation to understand the state of the conflict in the north Kivu province.
The city is a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with being a cheaper alternative to mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price for a short distance is around 500 Congolese francs.
In addition to being relatively difficult to reach, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for distant, exotic lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a marginalized suburb, although its reputation makes it a tourist destination and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
One of the biggest highlights in Henry Louis Gates' program was Africa's Great Wonders.
The city is very different from other cities inland, because it's characterized by a more Arab than African character.
The Kruger National Park is located in northeastern South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The area of this park is 19,500 square meters and it has 14 ecosystems, each one with a different type of forest.
It is considered one of the most attractive regions in South Africa, and it is also considered a major national park in South Africa (South African National Parks).
As is the case in all national parks in South Africa, there are expenses for daily maintenance and park entrance fees.
It's possible that buying a Wild Card will benefit you, as it allows you access to a selected group of South African parks or even all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider their destination.
The buildings on the Hong Kong skyline resemble a gleaming needle, which appears even more prominent in the reflection of the Victoria Harbour waters.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the waterfront opposite it.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is built on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers made into their own special area. So, if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest belt in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) across Bangladesh and India from the sea.
UNESCO declared the Sundarbans a place of scientific heritage. The part of the forest that is in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests aren't just mangrove remnants‚Äîthey also contain something remaining from the large forests that used to cover the Ganges Delta.
The Souss-Massa region covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, a third of which is covered by wetlands/lakes.
The Sundarbans transformations into a natural reserve started in 1966, and it contains approximately 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 gazelles.
Buses run from the intercity bus station (on the river) throughout the day, although most of them, especially those heading east towards Jerada/Boumia, leave between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
Because intercity buses are often full, it's best to book your ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts have small Japanese buses that are comfortable and reliable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places, like Paro (NU 150) and Punakha (NU 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It passes over the Oyapock River and connects the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The towers reach a height of 83 meters, their length reaches 378 meters, and they have two walkways that are three and a half meters wide.
Vertical clearance under the bridge is fifteen/15 meters. Construction was completed in August two thousand and eleven/2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017 two thousand and seventeen.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, which is when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the original inhabitants living in eastern Paraguay, living a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle, growing crops only for consumption.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes like the Guaycur√∫ and Payagu√°, who lived from hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," was established as a result of a confrontation between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began their colonization, which lasted three centuries.
When the Asunci√≥n association was founded in 1537, Paraguay was able to preserve its local character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The big tournament of the year will be in December at the polo fields in Las Ca√±itas.
Small tournaments and matches are held here at other times of the year.
To stay updated on polo championships and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Association website.
The currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is close in value to the British pound (GBP).
You can only exchange money at the only bank in the islands, which is located in Stanley on the road coming from the western FIC store.
The British pound will generally be accepted anywhere in the islands, and often they accept Stanley credit cards and even US dollars.
It might not be possible to use a bank card on the remote islands, although you can take British and American currencies; ask the vendors beforehand to find out the possible payment methods.
It's almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, that's why you need to exchange the money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is in the south of Ecuador, summer there is when it's raining in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone; temperatures often exceed 30 degrees Celsius during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptive in terms of cold: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel much colder than what the thermometer reads.
There aren't any seasons that are "very rainy" or "dry": the rainfall is consistent throughout the year.
Even though many of the zoo animals are used to seeing people, wildlife remains wild. We shouldn't feed them or disturb them.
According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
Despite appearing peaceful, buffaloes, deer, gazelles, bears, and almost all large animals are capable of attacking.
Dozens of visitors get injured every year because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are big, wild, and a potential danger, which is why they should be given their space.
In addition to that, be careful because smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking any food with a strong odor and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of slightly less than 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and was the official capital of Samoa from 1959.
The harbor was a place where a terrible naval battle almost broke out in 1889 when seven boats from Germany, America, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships sank, except for one British boat. About 200 Americans and Germans died in them.
In the struggle organized by the Maoist movement to gain independence, the supreme leader Tubua Tamasis Lilovi III died in a peaceful gathering in the city.
There are many beaches due to the intersection/overlap of the peach orchards of Auckland. The famous ones are located in three regions.
The beaches of the East Coast (in the Western Harbor province) are located in the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay beach in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and most of them offer shade from pohutukawa trees.
There are beaches along Tamaki Drive on the Waitemata Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches are usually full of families and have nice shops along the beach. You don't have to worry about swimming.
The local beer is 'number one,' not a complex beer, but enjoyable and refreshing. The other local beers are called "Manta."
There are many French routes that can be taken, but the routes of New Zealand and Australia are the ones that are traveled better.
Tap water is safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're worried.
The idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange to Australians. A small black coffee is an "espresso," while a cappuccino has a layer of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is one of Belgium's standards. Avocado juice is expensive but good.
Many trips to the coral reefs are organized throughout the year, and injuries to these coral reefs are rare.
Despite all that, take advice from the authorities, follow all the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes be found outside of this time.
Sharks come out, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't live in the ocean; the place they live is in the rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind and ensures they will have a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their desired destination.
Travel organizers often have deals with specific hotels, although you can book other types of accommodation, like campsites, through a travel organizer.
Travel organizers often have deals with specific hotels, although you can book other types of accommodation, like campsites, through a travel organizer.
They can also make the booking on your behalf if you need time to think about the offer or to get documents to have with you in the place you're going (like a visa).
Even so, any modifications or requests must be reviewed through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
Regarding some festivals, the vast majority of attendees at music festivals decide to camp on site, considering that part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to get there early so you can secure a camping spot near the music.
You need to know that even if the music stops in the main theater, some celebration materials might keep playing music until late at night.
Some festivals have areas where families with young children can camp.
If you're passing through the northern Baltic Sea area in winter, you should check the cabin's location, because passing over ice can cause severe discomfort to those most affected.
The Medina time is included in St. Petersburg cruises. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of efforts to increase the time and money that guests spend. There are usually no windows or clocks there, and it can be difficult to find an exit.
Or drinks or entertainment/animation to keep the guests entertained and staying at the venue.
Many places offer alcohol. Despite that, intoxication impairs focus, which is why gamblers know it's important to stay sober.
Anyone driving their car in high-latitude areas or on mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, there's less friction, and you can't drive like you're on a road that's just asphalt.
When blizzards come, they can drop an amount of snow that's enough to stop you for a little while.
You can't see well anymore when it snows, or when it rains hard, or when ice freezes on the car doors.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and roads are usually not closed throughout the year.
Safaris are what attract tourism to Africa in a big way, and they are the reason why many tourists go there.
Safari is the popular term that refers to overland travel to see the wildlife of Africa, especially the savanna.

The road between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging section for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, passing through some isolated lands and forests.
If you're not used to driving in the countryside, be aware: there are steep slopes, narrow passages, and sharp curves.
The speed limits that have been set are very low compared to what it was like before and after - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and adhering to them strictly is very important.
And the strange thing is that it seems mobile service is stronger here than in many other areas along the way, like the Pennsylvania forests.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and diverse, and resemble the pastries of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit-based desserts are popular, and apples are cooked in desserts year-round, while cherries and plums are in the summer.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, pistachios, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are always accompanied by a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small, rich pastries, try what's called Berliner, or Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish that relies on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.

Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, hanging on either side of the saddle.
It provides great stability for the driver, but it can have safety concerns because the driver's leg could get stuck in it.
If the rider falls off the horse but his feet remain stuck in the stirrups, the horse might drag him if it's running far. There are a number of precautions that can be taken to reduce that danger.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots that have heels and very narrow, soft soles.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leathers to come off the saddle if the falling rider is dragged behind.
Cochamo Valley - the premier climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of walls and large granite boulders.

Snow sports on slopes, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow-covered area on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is the activity that characterizes the travels of enthusiasts, who are called "perpetual skiers" and who plan all their vacations to ski in one place.
The idea of skiing is very old - there are drawings of skiers in caves that date back to more than 5000 BC!
The history of downhill skiing as a sport goes back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also known as ski touring, ski mountaineering, or ski trekking.
He's associated with Alpine ski touring or mountaineering, but it's not limited to just ski touring or mountaineering; he also practices it on very steep terrains that require stiff skis and tall boots.
Think of skiing as a path similar to hiking.
In good conditions, you can cover distances somewhat longer than walking, but you'll rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy pack and on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries means you'd have to go through visa applications and passport control many times.
The Schengen area functions like a single country in this respect, despite everything.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control checkpoints again.
If you've obtained a Schengen visa before, you won't need to get one every time you want to travel to Schengen member states, and that way you'll save time, money, and the hassle of paperwork.
There's no consensus on what materials that have been manufactured can be considered archaeological. Some tax authorities consider things that are over 100 years old as antiquities.
The definition includes geographical variations, where the age limit might be shorter in some places like North America compared to Europe.
Handicraft products can be considered as antiques, even though they are new compared to similar goods that are mass-produced.
Deer breeding is essential for the Sami people's livelihood, and their buying and selling culture is important for many other crafts.

Usually, the course lasts from 2-5 days and involves role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that talk about surviving in the wilderness are everywhere, but publications that talk about war zones are rare.
Travelers who want to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents with them to return.

The recognition of these documents by foreign governments varies greatly.
Searches at checkpoints have become very intrusive, especially in the period following the September 11, 2001 attacks.
Transgender people shouldn't expect that the scans done before the surgery won't infringe on their privacy and dignity.
Currents are the flow that comes back from the waves and enters the beach, often in coral reefs or something like that.
Because of the underwater topology, the returning flow doesn't accumulate in some deep places, and a strong current of water can form in that deep area.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion after trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back won't be more difficult than usual.
Try to find a place you've never been caught in before, or according to your abilities and whether you look like a girl or not, and you can wait until they come to rescue you.

Sometimes, travelers who find it easy to adapt to a new culture find it difficult to readjust to their original culture.
When you return to your country after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and forgotten some of your country's customs and traditions.
When I first traveled abroad, people were patient with me and understanding, knowing that a traveler coming from another country needs to adapt.
It's understandable that people might not realize that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning to their country.
The sound and light show at the pyramid are among the things that the children in the area enjoy.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and see them in silence before the program starts.

The Sphinx is telling a very long story.
They are putting on shows at the pyramids and they are lit up.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and are claimed by several countries and have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, and its largest island is King George Island, and the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
The others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, which contains a caldera of a still-active volcano, providing a stunning natural landscape.
Ellsworth Land is the area located in the south of the Peninsula, and is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Mountains from the peninsula gather here with the "Koudia" (a type of hill or small mountain) and then regroup to form the Ellsworth Mountains range, which is divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The western side of the Sentinel Range contains the highest mountains of Antarctica, Vinson Massif, which reaches a height of 4892 meters, Mount Vinson.
In remote places, where there's no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone might be the only option.
A satellite phone isn't generally a replacement for a cell phone, since you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to a satellite in order to make a phone call.
This service is mostly used in maritime transport, including pleasure craft, and even those missions that have data and voice needs.
Your local phone company should provide you with information about connecting to this service.
Traveling and learning is the most popular choice for people who are planning to take a gap year.
This is popular, especially among those graduating from school, as it allows them to take a gap year before university without their education being affected.

There will likely be some extra fees to register for these educational programs.
Finland is considered a good destination for boating. "The Land of a Thousand Lakes" also contains thousands of islands, in the lakes and also in the coastal archipelago.
You won't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelago and lakes.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are already great for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks give you a different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland, with roughly one boat for every seven or eight people.
This number is similar to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but apart from that, it's completely unique (like in the Netherlands, the number is from one to forty).
Most Baltic ships will remain in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historical city for a few full days when you are returning, or sleep on the boat at night.
If you're going to travel on coastal exploration cruises by boat, you won't need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises list Berlin, Germany in their flyers. However, you can see on the map that Berlin is not close to the sea, and even getting there is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially those who have never traveled before or who have had a bad accident.

You pay good money to shipping companies to get your things delivered quickly. Time is usually very important when it comes to work documents, goods, and spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some air routes, big companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there's a problem.
If some items are sent via air freight, it may take several days in some transit points for unloading and customs.
The only way to get it to you quickly was to send it as a registered package. An airline can't send a package without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The way it seems you can travel in first class or business class is to make a lot of money and pay for this privilege (or preferably, have your company pay for it).
Even so, this doesn't come cheap: like, with strict rules of thumb, you can expect to pay around four times the regular economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in searching for upgrade deals to business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there's a specific core group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and they'll cover the costs of that.
The capital of Moldova is Chi»ôinƒÉu. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (Transnistria), which declared itself in eastern Moldova, and which has its own government and currency, although it is not recognized by any United Nations member state.
And they re-established economic ties between these two parts of Moldova, even though the political negotiations failed.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

There are still many men and women living who lived their lives here, and many others who wanted those who were killed or were working until they died here, Jews and non-Jews, it's all the same.
Treat this place with all the dignity, respect, and honor it deserves. Don't laugh at the Holocaust or Nazism.
Don't vandalize the place with markings or graffiti on the walls of houses.
The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half the people prefer to speak in Catalan, and the vast majority of them understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are expressed in Catalan because it is considered the primary official language by law.

Even so, people who know a little Spanish might quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough to Spanish that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually old today and remain only as museums or places of study.
Because light pollution wasn't at its peak like it is now, they (telescopes/observatories) were usually located in cities or on university campuses, and they were easy to access, unlike those built in the modern era.
Most contemporary telescope research involves large facilities in remote areas with good climate.
Viewing cherry blossoms - known as Hanami - has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept came from China when plum blossoms were the favorite flower.
