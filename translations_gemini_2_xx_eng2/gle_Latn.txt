Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but it also provides details not usually found in fossils, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal had brown plumage on top and a cream or carotenoid colour underneath.
The discovery gives us insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur's feathers do not have a well-developed shaft (called a rachis), but do have other feather characteristics - barbs and barbules - the researchers realised that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary stage than those other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather to regulate temperature or for display. The researchers suggested that, although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the feather sample represents the plumage of the adult bird and not the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, although this is a tail from a young dinosaur, the plumage of the sample indicates that of a mature bird and not the soft down of a young bird.
Two police officers were killed and more than twenty others were injured when a car bomb exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning.
The governor's office said that nineteen of those injured were police officers.
The police said they believe a suspected Daesh (ISIL) militant was responsible for the attack.
They discovered that the Sun worked on the same basic principles as other stars: It was found that the activity of all the stars in the system was driven by their luminosity and rotation, and not by anything else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, a number related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic variations.

The Iraq Study Group presented its report at 12.00 GMT today.
He warns that no one can guarantee that any action will stop sectarian warfare, escalating violence, or a descent into complete chaos.
The first thing in the Report is a plea for open debate and the achievement of consensus in the United States on policy towards the Middle East.
The report criticizes almost every aspect of the Executive's current policy towards Iraq and recommends an immediate change of direction.
At the top of the list of 78 recommendations is that new diplomatic initiatives be undertaken before the end of this year to keep Iraq's borders safe from hostile intervention and to restore diplomatic relations with its neighbours.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
Tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way would create the effect that the team was looking for.
Just as the moon has a gravitational pull on the Earth, creating tides, the Milky Way is affecting the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter, just as normal matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of ring, and that it is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "very troublesome and frightening because of the very high death rate."
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the germ in the hospital, and at least two were hospital healthcare workers.
In one year, an infected person may infect 10 to 15 other close contacts.
Nevertheless, the percentage of XDR-TB in the overall group of people with TB appears to remain low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any one time in South Africa.

The first cases of the disease this season were reported late in July.
Pigs carry the disease, and mosquitoes then transmit it to people.
The outbreak has prompted the Indian government to take certain measures such as employing pig catchers in badly affected areas, distributing thousands of mosquito nets, and spraying pesticides.
The government has promised generous millions of encephalitis vaccine, as well, which will help health agencies prepare for next year.
Plans to deliver vaccines this year to the areas most historically affected have been delayed due to lack of funds and low priority compared to other diseases.

When the dam was built in 1963, it stopped the seasonal floods that spread sediment throughout the river.
This sediment was essential for creating sandbars and beaches, which acted as wildlife habitats.
As a result, there are two species of fish that are now extinct, and two others that are endangered, including the humpback salmon.
Although the water level will only rise a couple of feet after the flood, officials are hoping that will be enough to return the eroded sandbars towards the mouth of the river.

Infrared images show that temperature changes from night and day indicate that they are caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth that often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with them being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the US Geological Survey Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters seclude themselves in the booth and place a pre-printed paper ballot, marked with their chosen candidate, into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identification, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.
French electoral law codifies procedures in a rather strict manner.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that no envelopes have been added except those belonging to duly identified and duly authorised voters.
Candidates can have their representatives present to verify every part of the process. In the afternoon, votes are counted by a volunteer team under strict supervision, and according to specific procedures.

The United Nations peacekeepers, who came to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, are being blamed for the spread of the disease that started near the troops' camp.
The lawsuit alleges that waste from the UN camp was not properly disinfected, which caused a leak of bacteria into a tributary of the Artibonite River, one of the largest rivers in Haiti.
From the 1800s onwards, Haiti had no problem with the disease, until the troops arrived.
The Haitian Institute for Justice and Democracy has referenced independent studies suggesting that a Nepalese UN peacekeeping battalion unknowingly brought the disease to Haiti.
Danielle Lantagne, a United Nations expert on the disease, said that peacekeepers were likely the cause of the outbreak.

Uka's weapon failed while it was aimed at the head of the fifth man. Schnieder is in pain and blind in one eye, part of his skull is missing, and his face has been reconstructed from titanium.
Schneider gave his testimony via video conference from a USAF base in his home country.
Aside from Wednesday's event, Carpanedo participated in two individual races at the Championships.
Her first race was the Slalom, in which she got a 'Did Not Finish' on her first run. 36 out of the 116 competitors in that race had the same result.
In her second race, the Giant Slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting group with a total downhill time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winner, Claudia Loesch from Austria, and 1:09.02 slower than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished ninth.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to finish their runs, and 45 out of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom overall failed to achieve a ranking in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and we have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the names of those accused.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the superintendent of police, said that the accused entered the court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, nobody was hurt.
Nevertheless, he sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the crash happened was closed for a while as the emergency services were freeing the driver from a red Audi TT.
He was initially in James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then, accused of the murder of his own son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be tainted because her pictures have been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and courts have deemed that publishing photographs could be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee said "it seems that journalists are not maintaining the right balance if they publish pictures etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, has informed journalists that no further comment will be made until at least an indictment has been served.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, borders sought by Palestine based on the borders that existed before the Middle East War in 1967.
It is said that the future of the state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley were among the other topics covered.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years when an agreement is signed, but the PA only agrees to a presence for five years.
Supervisors were to closely oversee shooters in the supplemental pest control trial, as the trial would be monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under a hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage for Parks with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, says that the four marksmen chosen for the first round of shooting have been given comprehensive safety and training.
Martely swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in the last four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended that the interim president resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards fresh elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime, protests that began in October.
The failure to hold elections, some of which were due since 2011, caused the protests, which were sometimes violent.
There have been approximately 60 reported cases of iPod malfunctions causing overheating, resulting in fires in some instances, and leaving four people with minor burn injuries.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) says it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "non-serious."
The ministry's response was to say that Apple's postponement of the report was "a matter of utter regret".
The Mariana earthquake struck at nineteen minutes past nine (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday) in the morning.
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said that no damage had been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also indicated that there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
A number of hostages were rescued and it was confirmed that at least six people have died so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an old woman because she needed to use the toilet. Mendoza was shot with a bullet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating, in his free time, premature labour.
His research showed that fetal lungs mature faster with hormone administration.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two flight recorder 'black boxes' on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. The first manager I ever had. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. That was so uncanny to her. A strong woman."
According to a comment made by Dustin "Goldust" Runnels "Luna was as crazy as me...maybe even more so...I love her and I will miss her dearly...I hope she's in a better place now."
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, there was an 8 percent increase since 2008 in the number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic.
The then Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the poll share the view that they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to reign in Australia.
At extreme points of the poll, 29 percent of those questioned in the survey believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints his physical capacity was in doubt.
He was unable to take the drugs, which he needed to relieve his pain, because they are banned by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
The discovery was verified by several people around the beginning of February, using various hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
There is a possibility that comets were sources of water delivery to Earth along with organic matter capable of making proteins and fostering life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets come into existence, especially how the Earth came into existence, from a comet striking the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He said that the rumours were nothing more than "political claptrap and nonsense".
There is speculation that he will stand in the presidential election in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the old ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport is being provided and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there are no car parking or park and ride facilities available at the park.
There was concern about a lack of transport and the consequent possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the creation of a new species of bird on the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species emerged within two generations, although it was thought this process took much longer, due to breeding between the native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be fashioned into many different shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn out until it is a thin wire, which can be dipped and plated. It can be hammered or rolled out into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and adhered to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical. Red cabbage juice can be used to make an indicator.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on whether the chemical is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since a hydrogen atom is composed of one proton and one electron).
Thoroughly mix two dry powders together and use clean, wet hands to squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hand will react with the outermost layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
Nearly every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In addition, toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilisation, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women gathered together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and it is reflected back down, almost immediately.
A rocket put the satellite into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and views.
It takes a huge rocket over 100 feet tall to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The change in the world since the wheel was invented is incredible. The biggest thing that came out of it is transport systems that are easier and faster.
That's where the train, the car, and many other forms of transport came from.
They will have medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including pet cats and those outside) that eat the small prey that is even more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The concept of the niche is the easiest way to explain their success; each individual cat has a special job so that it doesn't compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social cats; they live in large groups called prides.
A pride of lions consists of one adult male and up to three related males, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
There tends to be a close relationship between the women, as it is a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behave like a pack of wolves or wild dogs, animals that are similar to lions (but no other big cats) in their rather strange and eternally deadly behaviour to their prey.
The tiger is a comprehensive athlete, able to climb (but not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with a force five times stronger than a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four cats are the only cats out of all the cats that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of the lion, it is more like a phrase of snarling, bellowed words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals that the ocelot hunts are smaller than it.
Scientists believe that badgers use their sense of smell to locate animals to eat (prey), by sniffing their tracks on the ground.
They have night vision that gives them a very good view in the dark, and they move stealthily, too. Owls hunt their prey by being the same colour as their environment and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment that is different from the environment they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new community will need different features or adaptations to compete strongly.
The native community is exactly as it always was, and they need the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, the similarities between them and the other population diminish.
Eventually, after thousands of years, or even millions, the two populations will look so different from each other that they may not be able to be named as the same species.
We call this process speciation, which directly means creating a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time and therefore feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with over 70 sharp teeth as well as another row of teeth in its gums, ensuring that nothing that crossed its path could escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a dual-pronged tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps even cannibalism.
He also attacked anything that came into the water; not even a huge dinosaur like the T. rex would have been safe from him.
While we would be familiar with most of their food, the Romans had their own share of strange or unusual feast items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
Another thing that was different, the poor people and the women would eat their food sitting in a chair, but the rich men preferred to have the custom of feasting together where they would lie on their side while eating their meals.
It's impossible that the people of ancient Rome ate foods that were brought to Europe from America or Asia in the centuries that followed.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and an ancient Roman never tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, and it was believed that the god resided there.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to cater to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
In every temple there was an open temple courtyard, and then there was a secret sanctuary that no one was allowed to enter except priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
A special sanctuary for the god was at the top of the tower.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Much of the lives of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The women did the cooking in the yard; the shops were just open counters looking out onto the street. The houses were built of stone.
There was no great forest in the land of Canaan, which made wood very expensive.
Not many people settled in Greenland. It is said in the Norse sagas that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while travelling further west, he discovered Greenland and it was Greenland that he named it.
But regardless of what he had discovered, Inuit tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was a 'Nordic country', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
This is not true, however. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the American Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The text is visible at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, we know that the large paper document (which is 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage early in its life.
Therefore, it was probably added as just a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed succeeded in liberating the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was under the control of the "Vichy" French. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the south of France, an invasion called "Operation Dragoon".
Within a fortnight, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture in which a large, significant group of people participate and live and work together, a society that exists.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil; it is related to the Latin word civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also determines the size of its society in some way.
City-states are precursors to nations. A civilization's culture is understood to involve the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and a reasonable degree of dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving behind any substantial historical evidence, and as a result, they are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially created a weak central government—with only the Congress—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, since there was no executive or national judiciary, it was dependent on state authorities to enforce all its acts, but those authorities often refused to cooperate.
He also had no authority to override tax laws or tariffs between states.
Unanimous consent had to be obtained from all the states before the Articles could be amended, and the states were so unconcerned about the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and they were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
There are approximately 7,000 islands in Japan (Honshu being the largest), which makes Japan the 7th largest island nation in the world!
Due to Japan's cluster/group of islands, it is often referred to, in geographical terms, as an "archipelago".
Taiwan was first mentioned back in the 15th century when European sailors sailing past the island christened it Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a headquarters in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in production practices regarding native grains and employing workers from China to work on the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after their defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which they ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, who ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better sense of what they looked like in the past.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration has continued to this day.
For example, 35mm is the most common still image photography format in the world, which was also the most used size in cinematography at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has continued on to digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide by 24 mm high, which can be confusing.
As it is said, 3:2 is the aspect ratio of this format (divide by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio).
Many common formats (APS formats for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds is a simple guideline, although it is sometimes dismissed or ridiculed, that creates dynamism and brings some order to an image.
He says that the most effective place for the main subject is where the lines intersect that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period in European history, the Catholic Church began to be scrutinised after becoming very wealthy and powerful.
For over a thousand years, the states of Europe were bound together by the Christian faith despite different languages and customs.
His pervasive power influenced everyone from kings to serfs.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church exist specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many people to question whether this fundamental principle was being followed.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain placed Germany under a naval blockade.
It was an effective strategy, through which vital military and civilian supplies were cut off, even though these sanctions violated generally accepted international law as codified in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of ocean, even endangering neutral ships.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the most widespread sentiments among the majority of citizens and nations.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid such a thing for future generations.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had only 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, a particular method was used to represent different periods of time; each phase of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
In addition to that, between each dynasty there would occur a period of instability in which the provinces were divided. The most well-known of these periods was the period of the Three Kingdoms which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During those periods there was fierce warfare between many of the nobility who were fighting to take possession of the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the Three Kingdoms period, when thousands died fighting to sit in the highest seat in the great palace at Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
In addition to that, after the Revolution, every male applicant was given a career opportunity, which allowed those with the highest ambition and the most success to prosper in their lives.
In the case of the military, it is equal in that army ranks are now based on merit rather than social class.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a great interest in spiritual matters. He used to meditate in a cave called "Hira'" on Mount "Noor" (light).
The cave itself, which still exists, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual desires.
The cave is located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In truth, it's difficult to find out if anyone knew he existed. When you're inside the cave, it's complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the multitude of surrounding mountains. Little of this world can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is one of the seven wonders that is still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to pay homage to deceased Pharaohs.
There are several pyramids on the Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt (the Great Pyramid being the largest), along with several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of his wives and family members.
The "bow up" marking looks very similar to a V and the "bow down" marking looks like a staple or a square with its bottom side missing.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (that's where your hand grips the bow) and pull the bow.
Usually, an up-bow has a gentler sound, and a down-bow has a stronger, more commanding sound.
There's no problem at all with writing down your own markings, but don't forget that the printed fingerings are there for a musical reason, so attention should be paid to them as a result.
A crowd of market women forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, four years old), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, all terrified, to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
In a carriage, they travelled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who were screaming and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage fully open.
At one point, someone in the crowd shook the head of a royal guard, who had been killed at Versailles, directly in front of the terrified Queen.
It was the people of the Philippine Islands themselves who paid for the costs of war associated with the imperialism of the U.S. as it tried to suppress the Philippine Islands.
They had to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to pay for a large part of the expenditure and interest on bonds established in the name of the government of the Philippine Islands through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super-profits derived from the exploitation carried out on the people of the Philippine Islands would have been fundamental gains for US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context from which the order was formed.
The High Middle Ages is the common name for that period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300) when the events in question took place.
The Early Middle Ages were followed by the High Middle Ages, and then the Late Middle Ages, which is considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas, in truth, from the pressure of technology or technological imperative to a strong understanding that human destiny is being driven by a fundamental logic pertaining to the laws of science and manifested in technology.
Most readings of technological determinism share two general theories: that technological development follows its own path that transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology consequently has "impacts" on societies that are inherent rather than socially learned.
For example, it could be said that because the car exists, the development of roads is necessary.
However, national road networks are not viable for a couple of cars, so new methods of productivity are being developed to reduce the cost associated with car ownership.
There are more accidents on the roads due to car over-engineering, and from this comes the development of new methods in healthcare to heal injured bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural certainty associated with it, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and a culture arose that were associated with that geography, and these, which were in harmony with the place of society, were superior to the laws that were applied unjustly.
Just as Paris was considered the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
He was known as the heart of comfort from 400 AD until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined with us in the twelfth century primarily due to the crusades, which returned with gifts such as silks and spices that were more valuable than those available in the Byzantine markets.
He was around at the time that the title of fashion capital was changed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highlight of the Gothic style was in the period between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
In the early days, Byzantine culture in the east greatly influenced clothing styles.
However, due to slow communication methods, styles in the east could be delayed by 25 or 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, their own style grew among the people of Western Europe, and this was one of the biggest developments at the time. It was their experience of the Crusades that led people to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture where enough food is produced for the grower and their family alone.
Subsistence agriculture is often a simple, organic system, in which saved seeds that are native to that ecoregion are used in combination with crop rotation or other reasonably simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in most developing countries.
Subcultures bring together people who share the same mindset and feel they don't fit into mainstream society; it's an opportunity for them to understand their own identity.
Subcultures can be defined by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
Linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical qualities, or various factors combined, can determine whether a particular subculture is a distinct subculture.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive style used symbolically, including fashion, gestures, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized with the help of adults when they were growing up, for reasons related to neglect, misfortune, or willful abuse.
Such children are said to be "feral". There are some feral children who were kept confined (sometimes by their own parents); in some cases it was a severe intellectual or physical defect in the child that caused the parents to abandon the child.
It is possible that feral children experienced child abuse or serious trauma before they were abandoned or ran away from home.
It is claimed that they were animals that other people raised; it is said that some of them lived in the wild on their own.
When non-human animals raise a person from the beginning, the feral child exhibits behaviours (within physical limitations) that are almost identical to the behaviour of the particular caregiving animal, such as fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool that supports people undergoing a new learning experience, such as using new software or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are embedded in the software and are designed to question, stimulate, and explain procedures that the student might find challenging to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for many different reasons, covering neglect, abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, compassionate and educational, but they do.
We feel that the foster care system is a safety net for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is designed to provide children with all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
Further dimensions follow from the characteristics of the Internet in terms of approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, it is said that "learning" and "socialisation" are what motivate most people to use the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" as newly inspiring elements when they investigated public responses to websites.
Due to the use of video recording, important discoveries have been made in interpreting micro-movements and facial expressions that last only a few milliseconds.
It is particularly required that a person be able to detect if someone is lying by interpreting micro-expressions.
In his paper The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks indicated that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that animals such as domestic dogs may possess this ability to make sense of people's behavior.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed changes.
Segregation and recombination move diversity back and forth between two pools in each generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its amino acid requirements from the plant resources available.
Furthermore, if this isn't done, there are disastrous consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant resources to access were the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide high quantities of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it's no wonder that our ancestors found a solution to the "protein problem" they had, almost in the same way that chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep disturbance is considered to occur when you are deliberately awakened during your normal sleep period before falling back asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a reasonably quiet alarm clock to bring you to a state of awareness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself snoozing the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Alternatives based on biorhythms involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or teas known to be diuretics) before going to sleep, so that you have to get up to urinate.
There is a negative correlation between a person's inner peace and the amount of tension in that person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more certain the life force that is present. Everyone has the ability to achieve complete peace and happiness.
Everyone can achieve insight. Nothing interferes with this goal except tension and a negative mindset that may be within ourselves.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they were expanded with the mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is a very simple thing. It encompasses Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualisation.
The Yoga Deity is at the heart of Tibetan meditation. Through visualizing different deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and insight into wisdom is gained.
Germany was generally an enemy in World War II, which spurred cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, however, disagreement arose between the countries due to their differences regarding political system, process, and culture.
Within two years of the end of the war, the former allies were enemies and the Cold War began.
He was to live for another 40 years and the fight would really be on, with proxy wars, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and some other places.
By September 17, 1939, the defense of Poland had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
Nevertheless, these plans were almost abandoned overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, which was a violation of the Peace of Riga Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Ships used to transport goods are by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional function of a navy is to ensure that your country can always move its people and goods, while simultaneously disrupting the ability of your enemy to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of this recently was the North Atlantic campaign in the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily through the use of U-boats, was trying to stop that traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to bring Britain under its control, as it did in the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them to have easy access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Generally, goats were kept in herds that roamed on hills or other grazing areas, with goat herders often in charge, and these were usually children or young people, like the shepherd that is widely known. These herding methods are still in use today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagonways were just parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to achieve better speeds and pull larger loads on paths that were a little rougher.
The tie bars were introduced quite early to secure the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realised that the rails would be more effective if they had a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron was the reason for more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
Walking is the first mode of transport known to us, people started walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (which means standing man) came into existence.
His predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as often.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a way that is more sympathetic to the environment, we can participate in the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is just like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if a temporary solution is not enough, then we should find the root cause of the problems and solve them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a great deal due to the scientific and technological developments of humanity, and that difficulties have increased due to overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyle of humanity.
After it was accepted by the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's print shop, which was a few blocks away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now called "Dunlap broadsides."
John Nixon was the one who first read this document publicly in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who ordered that it be read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 large Dunlap broadsides known to still exist are the oldest copies we have of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Some paleontologists currently believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. We call them birds.
Many people don't think they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that are still very similar to dinosaurs.
It has scales and claws on its feet, it lays eggs, and it walks on its two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost every computer in use today is based on the manipulation of information coded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, as they are called in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common that an immediate diagnosis may not be possible.
The best sign of a canister being poisoned by a range of medicines or poisonous household chemicals may be that it is/they are open.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term insect in the formal sense is what entomologists use for this group of insects.
The term bed bug comes from humans' long experience with these creatures; they are insects that are adapted to parasitizing humans.
Bed bugs and Assassin bugs are scolamánacha insects, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling place of their host.
There are approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States of America, making it the most common neurological disease affecting young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, that is, the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it would not be in their own interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise a child.
These couples have the option to make an adoption plan for their child.
To adopt a child, the birth parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main aim of science is to gain an understanding, through the scientific method, of how the world works. This is the method that guides most scientific research in reality.
But experimentation is not for its own sake, and experimentation is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and recording an opinion are scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinions were accepted on every scientific question, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, Western countries became detached from their roots in Greek philosophy and science.
The strength of observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depends greatly on the presence of endogenous pacemakers and their production by the body clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not solely responses to periodic external cues, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue to cycle freely, even when no external cues are given.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Mutations in germline cells alone can be passed on to children, but mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wild plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting orangutans in Borneo, taking photos of them, and learning about them.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns in their cars to go to their workplaces and pass other people whose work destination is the place just left by the first group.
In this dynamic transport environment, everyone is involved in and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has driven the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
Complaints about water quality or reports of bridges collapsing are not usually heard as much in developed countries.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why do they fail on a daily basis? Is it that transport engineers are not competent? Or is there some more fundamental reason for it?
Traffic Flow focuses on the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and on the interactions between them.
It's fair to say that it's difficult to study traffic flow because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with complete certainty.
Fortunately, driver behaviour usually falls within a reasonably stable range; therefore, relative stability is seen in traffic flows, and they can be represented mathematically to a greater or lesser extent.
To better illustrate traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship is a help when road facilities are being planned, designed and operated.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to easily avoid enemies and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage that they can fold their wings back flat against their bodies.
That gives them a wider range of small places to hide themselves from predators.
Nowadays, every insect, apart from the dragonfly and the mayfly, can fold its wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
There were people who thought he was right, but many others who believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This looks sensible, considering the Earth doesn't appear to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest river in the world. It carries over 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river in the world, with a width of six miles in places.
20 percent of all the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main river has a length of 6,387 km (3,980 miles). Water from thousands of smaller rivers flows into it.
Despite pyramid building in stone continuing until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of their size and the excellent technical construction they involved.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, monuments that were already over a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Italian is used by Vatican City in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, but Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
Every citizen of Vatican City is a Roman Catholic.
Since ancient times, people have had knowledge of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper because all of these can be found in nature in native form, and it is relatively simple to extract them from mines with basic tools.
The theory of the philosopher Aristotle was that everything is composed of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they convert into new substances to make what we see.
Alloys are mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys can also exist that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them would fit in the full stop at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came on the market.
It's a pity that the pencil isn't used as much now that new methods of writing have emerged.
People now write messages on computer screens, without needing to use a pen.
The question that has to be asked is what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes on the market.
The first fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to bind a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons together.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Some of that energy is released when the nucleus is split again.
Certain atoms have an unstable nucleus, which causes them to tend to break apart with little or no friction.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 cm thick on the side closest to us and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
Perhaps there are more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner there. It was easier for lava to come up to the surface.
Material theories focus attention on identifying the things that people need or the things that they enjoy.
It is claimed in these theories that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize as they grow into adulthood.
These are theories that focus on why certain people want to do certain things and what things in their environment would cause them to do certain things or not to do them.
Two common theories of content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of behavior can emerge as managers begin to lead their former peers. On one side of the story, the manager tries to remain "one of the lads" (or girls).
It is difficult for this type of manager to make decisions, administer disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, assign responsibility, and hold people accountable for things.
On the other hand, you could turn into an unrecognizable person who feels that they have to fundamentally change everything the team used to do, and impose your own style entirely on it.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behaviour often causes conflict between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual staff members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more independence than regular team members because their teams may come together according to different time zones that their local management doesn't understand.
Having a "real invisible team" is also a unique part of a virtual team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The "invisible team" is the same as the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization be interested in spending the necessary time to establish a learning organization? One goal for implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across an organization's functional departments, creativity and resourcefulness can emerge.
As a result, a new innovation process that satisfies the customer's needs may arise from the organisation's process of working together to overcome an obstacle.
Before new ideas can be introduced, leaders must create a culture of innovation, along with shared knowledge and organisational learning.
In Angel (2006), the Contanam approach is described as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, making the field of research narrower and far more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been recognized that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and brain tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain brain functions as a result.
The arrival of new technologies enables us to investigate the structure and processes of the brain as never before.
It provides a wealth of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand processes in the human mind.
Although AI has a strong flavour of science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behaviour, learning, and adaptation in machines.
AI research involves making machines automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples include ruling, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose and answer customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things are now distinct disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-world problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it is now built into several software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Teachers often want to take their students to places that aren't accessible by bus trip.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or enjoy beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website on the subject of their trip to the State Capital, every year the website is refurbished, but the old versions are kept online to function as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also be helpful in improving a student's writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes due to the presence of an audience.
Given that the most critical audience is often students, the blog writer starts trying to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
On top of that, blogging "makes students more aware of the world around them." The need to satisfy the audience's interest inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that fosters collaboration and encourages students to contribute to their learning outside the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs can "enable students to improve their analytical and critical skills; by responding actively to Internet content, students can express their own position in the context of the writings of others as well as outline their own perspectives on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's elegant, bilingual capital, and it is home to art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
With all that and more, Ontario is seen as the typical Canada in the opinion of strangers.
Not many people live in large areas further north, and some of it is wilderness that is almost uninhabited.
Here's a comparison of populations that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens in Canada.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is undoubtedly the largest and unique in its territory in terms of wildlife.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations, or affiliated with France, and recognised as luxurious holiday destinations.
The Arabs brought Islam to the lands, and it was eagerly adopted in the Comoros Islands and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route, which is the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the Sahel region borders it, and to the south and west, there is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Female travelers are advised to say they are married, regardless of whether they are or not.
It's also helpful to wear a ring (but don't wear one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that what might be considered harassment could be the result of cultural differences and that it is common for someone to follow you, grab your limb, etc.
Be strict when refusing a man's flattery, and don't hesitate to stand up for yourself (even if there are cultural differences involved, that doesn't make it right or fair!).
Berber fishermen founded the modern city of Casablanca in the 10th century BCE, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but it was abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and it was Spanish traders, who established trading bases there, who gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco for shopping.
Around the old part of the Medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide variety of herbal mixtures, but it's all for the sake of the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed as a result of lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which covered most of the town's streets, especially the town centre.
Although Goma is relatively safe, research should be conducted before visiting outside of Goma to assess the ongoing fighting situation in North Kivu Province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and you'll find some of the cheapest opportunities to track Mountain Gorillas in Africa there.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The typical (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Because it is also quite inaccessible, the word "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for remote, exotic, far-off lands.
Timbuktu is a poor town today, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat from desert sand.
It was featured as one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' special program on PBS, Wonders of the African World.
There is no resemblance between this city and other cities in the country, because it has an Arabic flavour rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in northeastern South Africa and is located along the Mozambique border to the east, along the Zimbabwe border to the north, and the Crocodile River is its southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 distinct ecoregions, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main things that attracts tourists and is considered the flagship park of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As is the case in all South African National Parks, daily fees are charged for conservation and entry to the park.
It used to be worthwhile for a person to buy a Wild Card, which provides entry to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of South African National Parks.
The Hong Kong territories take their name from Hong Kong Island, which is the main focus for many tourists.
Some people say that the parade of buildings on the Hong Kong skyline is like a spectacular bar chart seen reflected from the waters in Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront facing it.
The vast majority of urban developments on Hong Kong Island are built on top of each other on reclaimed land along the east coast.
This is where British colonists seized as their own, so if you want evidence of the days of the country when it was a colony, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans, the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extends 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, these are not just mangrove swamps — they encompass some of the last remaining clumps of the immense forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is wetlands/swamp.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that the area now contains 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but for the most part, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, they leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because intercity buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy, serve most areas.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers stretch 83 metres towards the sky, it is 378 metres long, and there are two lanes, each 3.50 metres wide.
The clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group who lived in what is now Eastern Paraguay; they lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing, also lived in the Chaco region.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, then known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," was founded as a result of the conflict that Spanish conquistadors had with the indigenous groups.
The Spanish started the era of colonisation, which lasted three hundred years.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known as a country with one of the best polo teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year takes place in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Competitions and small games can also be viewed here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and information on buying tickets for polo matches, check the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The Falkland pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falklands, is pegged at parity with the British pound (GBP).
Money can be transferred in the only bank on the islands located in Stanley across from the FIC West shop.
Generally, the British pound is accepted everywhere in the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also usually accepted.
There is a risk that credit cards will not be accepted on the outlying islands, although British and United States currency may be accepted; ask the owners in advance which method of payment will be acceptable.
It is almost impossible to use the Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is in the southern hemisphere, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures do not usually fall below +30°C in the summer months.
Winter can be colder than you might think; temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but it feels colder than the thermometer suggests when the wind and dampness combine.
There is no "rainy season" or "dry season": roughly the same amount of rain falls throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack people.
Every year, many visitors are injured because they didn't keep far enough away as they should. These are large, wild animals and they can be dangerous, so they must be given their proper space.
Also, remember that certain smells attract bears and other wildlife, so do not carry or cook foods with strong odours and always keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. The town is on the island of Upolu, and has a population of a little under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
It was in this harbour that a notorious incident occurred in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
Every ship went to the bottom, except for one British cruiser. Almost 200 people, both Americans and Germans, were lost.
During the struggle for independence organised by the Mau movement, a crowd gathered peacefully in the town, but as a result, the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed.
There are many beaches there, due to Auckland straddling two harbours. The most popular ones are found in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most are sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most have shade from pohutukawa trees.
The Chéide Tamaki beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, and there is a good range of shops close to the beach. Swimming is safe there.
'Number One' is the beer most popular with the locals, it's not a complex beer but it's very nice cold. "Manta" is the name of the other local beer.
There are plenty of French wines to buy there, but the travel might affect them more than wines from Australia and New Zealand.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easily available if you are worried.
If you're from Australia, the coffee concoction 'flat white' is a foreign concept. A small black coffee is called an 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of cream (not foam) on top, and milk isn't served with tea.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Several trips to the reef are taken throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes are rare on the reef.
Still, take advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay careful attention to safety warnings.
Lion's mane jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They are occasionally present outside of these times.
Although sharks exist, they are afraid of people and rarely attack. Most would swim away out of fear.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean; their main habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
If a place is booked in advance, the traveller is given peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when the destination is reached.
Travel agents can often make deals with specific hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that cover breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport, or even flight and hotel packages together.
They can also hold the booking for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of attendees at music festivals make the decision to camp on site, and most attendees consider that to be a central part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to get in early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember, although the music on the main stages may be over, there may be music being played in parts of the festival until late at night.
Certain festivals offer designated camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the Baltic Sea in the winter, check the location of your cabin, because when the ship is going through ice it causes terrible noise for those closest to it.
Some time is spent in the city during a Saint Petersburg cruise. Cruise passengers do not need a visa (see terms).
Casinos typically make every effort to maximize the time and money that guests spend there. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks and entertainment, to please guests and keep them in the restaurant.
Alcoholic drinks are offered free of charge in certain venues. However, intoxication impairs judgement, and every gambler knows how important it is to be in your right mind.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the risk of snow, ice, or sub-freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction, and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During a snow blizzard, so much snow can fall in a short amount of time that you could become stranded.
Falling or blowing snow, condensation, or ice on vehicle windows can limit visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in most countries, and traffic is not greatly disrupted throughout the year.
The safari is possibly the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
Travel across the country to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially the savanna, which is the classic idea of a safari.
It is common for certain animals, such as elephants and giraffes, to approach vehicles so that they can be clearly seen with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are shy sometimes and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "wilderness walk", "walking safari", or going "on foot") is hiking, whether for a couple of hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Certain events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, as they hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a difficult case.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March onwards, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not offer extensions until July 2020, the planned date for the Olympic Games.
It is estimated that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with a standard ticket costing ¥7,000.
Damp clothes can be dried by ironing them. Many hotels have an ironing board and iron, even if there isn't one in the room.
If an iron isn't available, or if you don't feel like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the iron get too hot (which could cause shrinking, or in worse cases, burning).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are effective against particular threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in other places, a couple of minutes are needed.
Filters vary in how effective they are, and if you have any concerns, then consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Tourists may have to deal with pest animals that they are not familiar with in their own country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in a worse case, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Typically, contagious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force are not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods in certain places without paying taxes or duties on them.
Travellers heading to countries with high tax rates can save a lot of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most challenging driving conditions can be found on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway on the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, which often passes through remote terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: they mostly consist of steep gradients, narrow lanes and sharp bends.
The speed limits are posted much lower than in previous and subsequent sections—typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and it is more important than ever that we adhere to them completely.
Strangely enough, though, the mobile phone service is stronger here than it is along many other parts of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite tasty, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, similar to those made in its neighbouring country to the south, Austria.
Fruitcakes are generally available, with baked apples inside them throughout the year, and cherries and plums can be found in them during the summer.
Almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts are part of some German baked goods. Often popular cakes go well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you like small but rich cakes, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, names that are given to them depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curries can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used with curries; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
And with a choice of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a wide range of regional cooking styles found throughout the country.
However, unless further qualifiers are used with it, the term generally means that the food is of origin from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago, in the form of a range of dishes that are simply flavored. Javanese people's favorite flavoring consists of peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups support the rider's feet, and they hang from either side of the saddle.
They give the rider better stability but people may be concerned about them because the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and their foot is caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots that have heels and soles that are smooth and quite narrow.
Following that, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars through which the stirrup leathers can fall off the saddle if a falling rider pulls back on them.
Cochamó Valley - the best place in Chile for climbers, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of big walls and granite crags.
On the summits, you'll find views from peaks that will take your breath away. Climbers from all corners are constantly discovering new routes among the limitless possibilities of the walls.
Snow sports with slopes, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which you slide down snow-covered ground with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity and many people are very dedicated to it, sometimes called "ski bums," who plan an entire vacation around skiing in a particular location.
Skiing is an ancient idea — skiers can be seen in cave paintings dating back as far as 5000 BC!
As a sport, downhill skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking through skiing: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, cross-country skiing or ski touring.
It's related, but usually doesn't involve cross-country or alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter done on hanging ground and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as being similar to a hiking trail.
If the weather is good, you'll be able to go further than you would on foot - but you'll rarely find cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a rather small continent, but it has many independent countries within it. Under normal circumstances, travelling through so many countries would force a person to apply for visas and go through passport control again and again.
In this respect, the Schengen area functions as if it were one country.
Provided that you stay within this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for any of the Schengen member states, and therefore you save time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes manufactured goods and antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as items that are more than 100 years old.
There are geographical variations in the definition, where the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade goods could be mistaken for antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami, and the culture associated with the trade is also important, even for people who have other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding; they lived by fishing, hunting, and doing similar things, and reindeer were mainly used as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
The word "gypsy" is in widespread use, but it, especially among non-Romani people, is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Romani people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance could be affected.
Perhaps you, too, might like to get advice from a government other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As one example, American citizens might have to deal with different circumstances in the Middle East than a European or Arab citizen would.
An advisory report is simply a brief summary of political circumstances in a particular country.
Often the opinions presented are general, oversimplified, and brief compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a generic term for any type of dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, disrupt life, or endanger human life.
Adverse weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hailstones, rainfall, and wildfires are effects of bad weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, squalls, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include snow showers, snow storms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather risks in the area they are in, as it could make a difference to travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
If you do an internet search for 'Course in a hostile environment' it is likely that the address of a local organisation will be provided.
Usually the course covers all the material discussed here, but they are discussed in much greater detail, and practical experience is usually provided.
A course usually lasts between 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, plenty of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that deal with wilderness survival are widely available, but few publications deal with war zones.
Tourists planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documentation for the return journey home.
Not every government is equally willing to issue a passport without the sex being stated on it (X) or an updated document to include a chosen name and gender.
The same variation exists in terms of how willing foreign governments are to respect these documents.
Security checkpoint searches have become much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender people pre-surgery should not expect to go through scanners without any interference to their privacy or dignity.
Rip currents are flows of water returning seaward from waves that have broken on the beach, often near a pier or similar structure.
Due to the underwater topography, the returning flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, and a rapid current to deep water can be created there.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current, something that might be achievable.
Swimming back isn't harder than usual, but escape the current first.
Trying to aim somewhere you weren't born, or depending on your skill level and whether you were noticed, it might be better to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock starts earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more intense.
Sometimes it is very difficult for travellers who have easily become accustomed to a new culture to readjust themselves to returning to their native culture.
When you return after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travellers in a new country have to adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding will also be necessary for travellers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually, the sound of tourists and vendors can be heard here. The sound and light show is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is the backdrop and the narrator in the long story.
The scenes are often shown on the pyramids, and the various pyramids are lit up.
More than one nation claims South Shetland Islands, which were first discovered in 1819, as their territory. The islands have the highest number of bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the Peninsula. King George Island, which contains the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest island.
Other examples include Livingston Island, and Deception Island, where the underwater caldera of a still-active volcano creates a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Antarctic Peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the Sentinel Range are hidden in the plateau, before they reappear as the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km range separated by the Minnesota Glacier.
The highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest point is Mount Vernon at 4892 m, are located in the northern part or in the Sentinel Range.
In remote locations, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
Generally, a satellite phone doesn't directly replace a mobile phone, because you need to be outside and have a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a call.
Among the groups that frequently use this service are shipping fleets, including pleasure boats, as well as tours that have telemetry and remote voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
Among those planning a gap year, the option to travel and learn is becoming increasingly popular.
Many school leavers choose to do this, it gives them a gap year before going to university, without interrupting their education.
In many cases, if you take a course during a gap year abroad you could improve your chances of getting into higher education when you return to your home country.
A tuition fee is usually charged to register for these educational programs.
Finland is a wonderful place for boating. This "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the islands and lakes.
Although the largest coastal archipelagos and lakes are indeed quite large for any yacht, a different experience will be found in smaller boats than that, or even in a kayak.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is on par with Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it's unique in every other way (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is between one and forty).
A long visit to St. Petersburg in Russia is part of most Baltic Cruises.
That means you can spend a couple of full days in the historic city and return to sleep on the overnight ship.
If you only disembark using cruise ship excursions, you would not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Berlin, in Germany, appears in some cruise brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near any sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling in an airplane can frighten people of any age or background, especially if it's their first flight or if they have had a previous trauma.
You shouldn't be ashamed because of it: there's no difference between it and the personal fear and hatred that many people have of other things.
For some people, understanding how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help them overcome a fear based on the unknown, or on not being in control.
Courier companies are paid well for delivering things quickly. Often, time is money, and it's very important to get business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs in a timely manner.
The largest companies own their own planes on certain routes, but there was a problem for other routes and smaller businesses.
If they shipped things by plane, in some ways they might have been waiting days to come through with unloading and customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or, better still, to get your company to do it for you).
However, this isn't cheap: as a general guide, you could expect to pay up to four times more than economy class for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally, it's not worth wasting your time looking for discounts on business class or first class seats on direct flights going from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there's a certain core group of fliers who are willing to pay a premium for the advantage of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge the appropriate fees accordingly.
Chişinău is the capital of Moldova. Romanian is the language of the local people, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered ethnic conflict.
In 1994, as a result of this conflict, the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria was created in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any member state of the United Nations.
Economic links have been re-established between these two areas of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
Eastern Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
It was once the ancient city of Smyrna, but now it is a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, situated around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
Traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and chapels are visible here and there among the wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centres, though the city's atmosphere is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldarsvík you can get views out to the nearby island of Eysturoy and it has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, some tombstones have interesting marble sculptures of doves.
It was worth spending half an hour walking around the very interesting village.
To the north, and quite close to it, is the interesting romantic town of Sintra, which has attracted attention from foreigners since Lord Byron praised its appearance to the skies.
The Scotturb 403 bus travels regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
And also to the north, visit the Termon Mór Marian Shrine of Fatima, a place that is famous throughout the world for Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a vast burial ground, a site of immense significance for a considerable portion of the world's population.
There are many men and women still alive who survived their time here, and many others who were murdered or killed by the work of people who were related to them, Jews and non-Jews alike.
You are asked to treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make fun of the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by putting graffiti on or scratching the structures.
Catalan and Spanish are the official languages of Barcelona. Around half the population speaks Catalan, the majority understands it, and very few people don't have Spanish.
Nevertheless, most of the signs are shown in Catalan only because it is legally established as the primary official language.
Still, Spanish is widely used in the public transport system and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the Metro are made only in Catalan, but in the case of unplanned disruptions, an automated system announces it in a wide range of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parasites are known for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
While this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with Parisians is still to behave well, like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will be much easier to get around if you do that.
Parasites will lose their fierce appearance if you are well-mannered with them.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has forest cover, primarily beech, spruce, and fir trees, and contains a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
A significant wide range of plant types exists, due to its great multitude of microclimates, diverse soils and varying levels of altitude.
A wide variety of animal and bird species can also be found in this area.
It is possible to find rare fauna there such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat and the capercaillie, along with many more common species.
And when visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and also wear a covering on their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer headscarves to women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially brightly colored ones, you'll get a big smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are asked to wear trousers that cover the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but those clothes aren't washed every time they're worn, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all for the men!
Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (pork specifically), and olive oil is used throughout, as it is in similar areas in the Mediterranean region.
Pa amb Oli, which translates to bread with oil, is a simple dinner that is very popular, especially during the summer: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Every noun that comes after the word Sie, meaning 'you', is capitalised, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It could be said that reading is also easier as a result, although the writing is quite complex due to the need to figure out whether a verb or an adjective is used in the substantive form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy because every word is pronounced exactly as it is written.
It is necessary to watch out for the letters c and g more than any other letters because their pronunciation depends on the vowel that follows them.
Also make sure that you pronounce r and rr differently: caro means expensive, but carro means cart.
Persian grammar is relatively easy and mostly regular.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar book would help you learn a lot about Irish grammar and gain a better understanding of phrases.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, you will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
Nevertheless, people with a little Spanish may quickly come to the opinion that Portuguese is close enough that it doesn't need to be studied on its own.
Few pre-modern observatories are still in use today, most are museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution wasn't a problem during their heyday, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, and are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms are the flower of choice.
In Japan, the emperor didn't host the first cherry blossom parties for everyone, but only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look good in their natural environment, so don't give in to the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you are visiting a formally arranged garden, you will be thrown out without discussion if you are collecting "specimens".
Singapore is usually a very safe place and a very easy place to get around, and you can buy almost anything there while you're there.
However, because it is located in the "high tropics," a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (constantly) and strong sun (if the sky is clear, which isn't that often).
Some buses go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check if the bus you intend to take is going into Hebron, and not just to the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba which is nearby.
Inland waterways could be a good theme when planning a holiday.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or going on a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or going boating along the Erie Canal.
They mark out routes used for popular walking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the holiday are followed by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There's a tradition of not sleeping a wink on Easter night and spending the night at some exposed point waiting to see the sunrise.
Of course, Christians have a theological explanation for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
The Easter Vigil is often held by more traditional churches on Saturday night during Easter weekend, with the congregation often beginning the celebration at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
All the animals that first reached the islands arrived there by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because mammals couldn't get there as the distance from the mainland was too far for them, the giant tortoise managed to become the primary grazing animal in the Galápagos Islands.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a very good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be almost completely dark day and night.
Because those regions are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore not often a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The work culture in Japan is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners would be used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and workers use surnames or job titles when addressing each other.
There is nothing more important than compromise in the workplace, which emphasizes the effort of the group rather than the achievement of the individual.
Workers often have to get approval from their superiors for any decisions they make, and they are expected to comply with the orders of their superiors without question.
