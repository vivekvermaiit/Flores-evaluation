This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had wings, a theory already abundant, but also provides details that fossils usually couldn't convey about color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal has chestnut-brown wings on the upper side and the lower part is yellow or carotenoid in color.
This research provided information about the development of feathers in birds.
Researchers speculate that while dinosaurs may not have possessed a well-developed shaft in their feathers, known as a rachis, but did have other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – the rachis likely developed later in evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were used for temperature regulation or display, rather than flight. Researchers suggest that, even though it is a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen shows adult feathers, not downy fluff of a hatchling.
Researchers suggest that even though this is a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen exhibits adult plumage, not a chick's down.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made from the Sagittarius A* region.
The effect the team was looking for is caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the Earth, creating tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a type of halo around the galaxy, and is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, insert a pre-printed sheet of paper representing their preferred candidate into an envelope.
After the voter's identity is verified by the officials, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.

Since 1988, ballot boxes should be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelope is present at the start of polling and that no envelope has been added besides the due count and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, specific procedures are followed, and the votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision.

Deputy Inspector General DK Arya said, "We have arrested the five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhoot Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaja Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of Police Chandrashekhar Solanki said that the accused, whose face was covered, was presented in court.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed, no one was injured.
Although the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road was temporarily closed following the accident, while emergency services extricated the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
He has been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of his son since then.
He is in custody for charges and trial, but anyone's eyewitness testimony could be tainted because his image has been widely publicized.
This is more common elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have viewed the publication of pictures as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University noted that "by publishing pictures of suspects etc., journalists are walking a dangerous line."
The Crown Office, which is in overall charge of the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made at least until indictment.
According to the leaked documents, it mentions the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Reportedly, other topics covered included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
After signing the agreement, Israel demands a military presence in the valley for ten years, while the PA only agrees to allow such a presence for five years.
The integrated pest management trial was monitored by surveillance rangers because the trial was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In partnership with NSWPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., eligible volunteers have been recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and heritage with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation received extensive safety and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission is Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Violent protests have sometimes been triggered by failures to hold elections, some since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod malfunctions have been reported, including a total of six fires and four minor burn injuries.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said that it had information on 27 accidents related to equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents to them, which the company called "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable."
An earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (09:19 AM GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Office of Emergency Management said that no reports of damage of any kind have come in from the country.
And also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that there were no signs of a tsunami.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a retired Filipino policeman hijacked a Hong Kong tourist bus.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and the death of at least 6 more people has been confirmed.
A total of 6 people, including children and the elderly, were released soon, among whom was a photographer.
Later, when the photographers and an old woman went to the toilet, they took her place, and in this way, Mendoza was killed.
Following in his father's footsteps, Ligins pursued a career in medicine.
She received training as an obstetrician and gynecologist and began working at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working at the hospital, Liggins began research into premature labor in his spare time.
Research suggests that administering a certain hormone can accelerate the maturation of a baby's fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered the two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna Vachon was the first queen. I'm the first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as weird as us... maybe even more so... Love her and miss her... Hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election who oppose Australia becoming a republic, there has been an 8 percent increase since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the people surveyed shared the view that they wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the peak of the survey, 29 percent of those involved believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but doubts about their fitness have arisen due to their complaints.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to relieve his pain because he had been banned from sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software until early February, and an announcement was made on Tuesday.
Comets were likely a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
53-year-old Cuomo began his administration at the start of this year and last month signed the bill legalizing gay marriage.
He referred to the rumor as "political drivel and stupidity".
There was speculation about her running for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that NextGen is a system that allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology, unlike the old ground-radar-based technology, allowing air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport is being put in place, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of transportation shortages increased the likelihood that the team would be forced to play the game behind closed doors, without supporters.
A study published in a science journal on Thursday reported the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have shown that new species can evolve in as little as two generations, although this process takes longer due to breeding between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be molded into even small sizes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and plated. It can be marked or rolled into sheets.
Gold can be made very thin and applied to other metals. Gold can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
"Tell me the pH of an acid. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice."
Cabbage juice changes color based on whether a chemical is acidic or alkaline (basic).
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in a tested chemical.
A hydrogen ion is a proton because it is a hydrogen atom that has lost its electron (since hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Grind two dry powders together and then, with clean wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture of open hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities like Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women lived together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A satellite call travels into space and is then reflected back almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and images.
Placing a satellite or telescope in space requires a massive rocket taller than 100 feet.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. What is arguably the greatest invention for us, provides us with very easy and fast transportation.
This is for my train, car, and many other transportation equipment.
Down there are mid-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to deer and antelope.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral pets) that eat various small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to success lies in the concept of niche, a specific job that every cat has, preventing them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
The pride consists of three related adult males, along with thirty females and cubs.
Due to large families with sisters and daughters, women are usually closely connected to each other.
A lion pride functions much like a wolf or dog pack, with the animals behaving remarkably similarly to lions (but unlike other big cats), and they are also very deadly to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though newly adept), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times more than the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four cats are able to roar.
The roar of a tiger isn't like the full, resonant roar of a lion, but rather like a harsh, screamed series of syllables.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all of the animals that ocelots prey on are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find their prey using their sense of smell, especially when the prey is on the ground.
It can see very well in the dark at night and can also move very quietly. The ocelot blends in with its surrounding environment to hunt its prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it came (such as if it moves across a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it can easily retreat to new places), it often finds itself in a different environment than before.
In this new environment with different resources and different competitors, the new population needs different traits or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than before.
The original population has completely changed, yet it still needs to adapt as it did before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, two populations appear so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide, which humans breathe out.
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food that we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, which is why it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
A long jaw with over 70 razor-sharp teeth embedded in it, along with an extra set on the roof of its mouth, meant that nothing could pass through it.
I can't say for sure, but this test seems very strange. The food contained turtles, large fish and other shellfish, and it may also be cannibalistic.
It is also said that if anything comes into the water, it attacks, so much so that even a huge dinosaur couldn't survive in front of it.
While much of their food was familiar to us, the Romans had a share of bizarre or unusual feast items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women used to sit on chairs and eat their food, rich people preferred to feast together, where they remained in their favor, even though they were together.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include foods that would arrive in Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, he didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People used to offer sacrifices to the deities, and priests tried to fulfill the deities' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests can enter.
Sometimes, specially pyramid-shaped towers, which were called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower has a special shrine dedicated to God.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, homes are very important.
The Hebrew family spent most of their life in the open air.
The woman was cooking food in the courtyard; the open store counter was visible to those in the street. Stones were being used to build the house.
In the land of Canaan, there is a large forest now, so the wood is extremely expensive.
Greenland is very sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland, hoping it would entice settlers.
But without worrying about its discovery, the Eskimo tribe was already living there long before.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian' in some way, there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, then you can imagine that a treasure map was written behind the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The words "ORIGINAL DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE DATED 4TH JULY 1776" were written behind the Declaration of Independence. It appears inverted at the bottom of the text document.
Although it is certainly not known who wrote the Agora, it is known that early in its life, the large parchment document (the Agora measures 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was rolled for storage.
It seems this was added as just one label for the indication.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
This "Vichy" was governed by the French. These were the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting the invaders.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces invaded Southern France, the invasion being called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated Southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture that is shared by a significant large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," meaning citizen, related to the Latin "civicus," also meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and it also defines any kind of S-shaped form.
City-states were the forerunners of nations. A civilizational culture means the transfer of knowledge across generations, a slow cultural footprint, and impartial dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with the Congress as its sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, nor did it have a national executive or judiciary; it depended on state officials to implement its decisions, who were often uncooperative.
A single state doesn't have the authority to override tax laws and duties between states.
Unanimity of all the states was required before amending the article, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international sports and Olympic events.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island country in the world.
Due to being a cluster/group of islands, Japan is often called an archipelago for geographical purposes.
Taiwan's history began in the 15th century when European sailors crossed and named it Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its base in southwestern Taiwan, initiated changes to ancient grain production methods, and employed Chinese laborers in their rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty's (1644-1912) army occupied the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which Taiwan was ceded to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures, such as the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
To give the tourist a better understanding of what it originally looked like, most of the buildings at the edge of the complex were reconstructed.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the most popular still image photography in the world is 35mm, which was the most effective film size at the end of the analog film era.
Even today, they are built, but their length-to-height ratio is leveled from digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The width-to-height ratio of this format (obtained by dividing by 12 to get a common integer ratio) is said to be 3:2.
A very common format (for example, the APS family format) has this aspect ratio equal to or very close to equal.
They were heavily criticized and often ridiculed, but the rule of thirds is a guideline for arranging elements in a photograph to create dynamism and visual interest.
It is said that the most effective place for the main subject is the intersection point of the lines that divide the photo into horizontal and vertical thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, rose to prominence in everyone's eyes.
Despite differences in language and customs, Christianity bound the states of Europe together for over a thousand years.
A universal power had influenced everyone, from the king to the common man.
According to a core Christian principle, the use of wealth should alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's monetary funds should be specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church has been based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth has led many to question whether this principle is being fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international rules, codified under various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has laid mines in the international waters of an entire sea area, preventing ships from entering, thereby endangering even neutral vessels.
Because this strategy offered a limited response, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the majority of citizens and the prevailing attitude of the country were of pacifism and isolation.
Seeing the horror and atrocities of the First World War, countries desired to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US to meet Thomas Edison with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager in his previous job).
In ancient China, there was a unique way of marking different time periods; each period or ruling power in China was a distinct dynasty.
There was a temporary era of divided states between each dynasty. The most famous period between the Han and Jin dynasties was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years.
During this period, there were fierce battles between many kings for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the era of the Three Dynasties was the bloodiest period, with thousands of lives lost in the wars fought for the grandest throne in the magnificent palaces of Xian.
It had a great social and political impact such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from dictatorship to republicanism, nationalism, and the idea that the state belongs to the people, not to a king.
Even after the revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, of whom the most ambitious and fortunate succeeded.
The same system was implemented in the military because army ranks are now based on merit rather than class.
The French Revolution inspired the oppressed working classes in many other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond this worldly life. He would frequently go to a cave known as "Hira" on a mountain called "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave, which had maintained its existence for a long time, vividly portrays Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Makka, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Indeed, finding the Agora isn't easy even if one knows it exists. Once inside the cave, it's complete isolation.
Apart from the clear, beautiful sky above and a few mountains nearby, nothing else could be seen. Very little of the world could be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the people of Egypt in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built for Khufu's wives and family members.
The upward arc symbol looks like a V, and the "downward arc" symbol looks like a staple or square with the bottom part missing.
The above means that you should push the bow starting from the tip, and the below means that you should pull the bow starting from the frog (where your hand holds the bow).
Up-bows typically produce a softer sound, while down-bows are stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to mark your own score in the book, but remember that the printed Bao Ying scores are for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
Riding in a carriage, they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd shouting and threatening against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their car windows open.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The cost of the American imperialist war in the conquest of the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay a large share of the expenses of the American colonial regime and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Certainly, the super profits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipino people are the core profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that motivated the creation of the order.
The period during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD) is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages.
The High Middle Ages came after the Early Middle Ages and before the Late Middle Ages, traditionally considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a very broad range of ideas. Technology-push, or technological imperative, simply means that we humans are driven by a logic linked to scientific laws and their expression in technology.
In technical terms, most interpretations revolve around two common ideas: that the development of technology follows a path separate from cultural or political influences, and that technology "impacts" society from within rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that roads are being developed because of motor cars.
Although the widespread road network in the country is not just for cars, efforts are underway to reduce the cost of cars through new production methods.
Even with more cars than needed, the risk of accidents increases, which necessitates the discovery of new technologies in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
A major component of Romanticism was cultural determinism, which was taken from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and with time customs and cultures related to that geography arose, and this, being adapted to the place of the society, was better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame began around 400 AD due to being a center of luxury and lasted until about 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century, the situation further deteriorated, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts like silk and spices, which were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.
That was the time when the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the attire was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, the style lagged behind the West by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest events of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is that agriculture which is done to produce enough food only to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system that utilizes a crop rotation of seeds preserved in that environmental region or other relatively simple techniques combined to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
A subculture is a gathering of like-minded people who feel marginalized by societal norms and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subculture members can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
The qualities that define a subculture can be a combination of linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or all elements.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and speech.
One of the most common methods used to clarify the importance of socialization is to focus on some unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children are imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, such abandonment of a child occurs because parents reject the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children have likely experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
It is said about others that they kept animals; it is said about some that they lived alone in the forest.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child exhibits behavior almost entirely like that of the caregiving animal (within physical limitations), such as fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is meant to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not just a new way of learning, but a tool that helps those who gain experience in learning new things, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software, and they question, prompt, and explain all those processes that might be challenging for students to handle on their own.
Children are placed in care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even trafficking.
No child should grow up in an environment that isn't nurturing, caring, and educational, but they are.
We see the foster care system as a safety net for all these children.
We understand the foster care system to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
They expect nurturing care to fulfill all the needs they lacked in the home from which they were previously taken.
The internet acts as a link between mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The internet is carrying additional dimensions in terms of specific qualities, uses, and satisfaction.
For instance, Internet use for "education" and "socialization" has been shown as an important motivation (James et al., 1995).
"Individual participation" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified by Ighimi and McCord (1998) as novel motivational aspects when they examined visitor feedback on websites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions and facial movements that last for only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting micro-expressions, one can tell whether a person is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper "The President's Speech," pointed out that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess honesty.
He also stated that such a capacity to interpret human behavior might be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has revealed that genetic variation exists in two forms: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes some of the visible variation from the population.
Segregation and recombination reshuffle differences between the two groups in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for primates with a human-like digestive system to meet their amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
And not only that, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant, with protein available in all its resources - leaves and pods - is difficult for primates like us to digest until it is cooked.
In contrast to grains, animal-based feed (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible for chicks, but also provide a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" to some extent in a way similar to how chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of waking up properly within a normal sleep period and then falling back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a quiet alarm clock to bring oneself to consciousness without fully waking oneself up.
If you can reset the clock with its alarm in your sleep, then it can be placed on the other side of the room, so you can comfortably get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, which forces people to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in their body and soul.
The less stress there is, the more positive life energy becomes. Everyone has the capacity to find complete peace and contentment.
You can obtain all the information. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It involves Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
Kundalini energy (energy of consciousness) is awakened through yoga mudras, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization along with Kundalini Yoga.
Tibetan Dhyan is centered on Dhyati Yoga. Through the दर्शन (darshan) of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and wisdom consciousness is cultivated.
In World War II, Germany was a common enemy, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, differences in systems, processes, and cultures led to a parting of ways.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and a Cold War began.
This was going to last for the next 40 years and in reality, was fought by proxy armies, from Africa to Asia, on battlefields in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, this plan was rendered almost obsolete overnight when, in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral, over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern territories.
Using ships for cargo transport to carry large numbers of people and goods across oceans remains the most efficient method to date.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that their country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with the ability of their enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples is the World War II North Atlantic campaign. The Americans were trying to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
The German Navy mainly tried to stop the traffic by using U-boats.
If the Allied nations fail, then Germany would probably be able to achieve victory over Britain because it had the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats are generally kept in herds that roam in mountainous or other grazing areas, often under the supervision of a shepherd, who may be children or adolescents. This method of animal husbandry is still in use today.
Wagonways were built in England in the 16th century.
But the wagons had only parallel wooden planks, which helped the horses run faster and pull more weight than on rough roads during the day.
The use of crossties to hold the rails in place began long ago. Gradually, however, it was realized that tracks would be more efficient if they had a piece of iron on top.
This has become common, but iron wagons cause more wear and tear on wooden wheels.
Later, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking; humans started walking upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Before that, Australopithecus habitually walked upright.
Bipedal specialisation is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been able to walk on two legs seven million years ago.
We can all start being more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce the suffering of the future to some extent.
This is like symptomatic treatment in many cases. But, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
It is clear that the world is changing a lot due to science and technology of mankind, and there are many problems due to the increasing population and the different ways of living of mankind.
Following the Continental Congress's adoption of the Declaration on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
Around 150 to 200 copies were made at night, which are now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon on July 8th in the yard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his soldiers in New York on July 9th. A copy of it reached London on August 10th.
25 Dunlap broadsides are known to exist, making it the oldest surviving copy of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't understand it's a dinosaur because it has wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still make them look like dinosaurs.
It has feet with scales and claws, it can lay eggs, and it walks on its two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits - when using computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms like vomiting are common enough that an immediate diagnosis may not be possible.
The best indication of internal poisoning might be the presence of open containers of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in the common language of insects.
This word refers to a species similar to bedbugs that can live and survive on humans.
Bloodsucking insects and bedbugs are both parasites that live in homes made by others.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple can decide whether raising children is in their best interest or not in the interest of their children.
This couple may choose to plan to adopt a child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method truly guides most scientific research.
Although it is only a new one, experiment, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more potential hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas were accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge diminished, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Observed in physiology and behavior often depends on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production via biological clocks.
Endogenous rhythms, which are not simply a response to external periodic cues, have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain free-running cycling periods even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to transplant their own DNA into a bacterium.
He performed two experiments in which he labeled either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, mutations can have different effects, based on the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the cells affected are germ-line cells or not.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife, plants, and animals.
Examples of activities on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting the park, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is learning, photographing, and studying about Orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave from small towns in cars to go to their workplaces, and others pass by them whose work destinations are the places they just left.
Everyone is connected in a new way in this dynamic transport shuttle, and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this vast carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development for the past two hundred thousand years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Do transportation systems generate so many complaints because they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and their interactions with one another.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, the driver behaves within a reasonably consistent limit; thus, there is some reasonable stability in the traffic flow and it can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship was established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This guide helps in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back against their body.
It provides a wide range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, only dragonflies and mayflies are the insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, which includes the sun (and even other stars).
He seems smart, because the Earth doesn't seem like it's rotating to him, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
Approximately 20 percent of all the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It gathers water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The New Kingdom Egyptians marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were already more than a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communication.
Italian is also a common language that is used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because these could be found in their native form in nature and were much easier to extract with older tools.
Aristotle, a scholar of philosophy, gave the rule that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. They were earth, water, air and fire.
These are like the four states of matter (in one line): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also states that it changes into something new that we have here.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You may also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
An atom is so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil has been a good friend to many people when it comes out.
It is regrettable that as new methods of writing have emerged, the status and use of pencils have diminished.
People now write messages on computer screens, they hardly ever need to go near a pencil sharpener anymore.
One can only wonder what the keys on the keyboard do when something new comes.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to hold a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
Like a heavy cart rolling down a hill, the nucleus splits again and releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they break apart very quickly or spontaneously.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick near the edge and 100 km thick farther away.
It is thin under Maria and thick under the highlands.
The crust is thinner on the sides, so it's easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory focuses on figuring out what attracts people or appeals to them.
This theory reveals that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internally shaped as they mature into adulthood.
This theory looks at how some people want the same things that others have and what in their environment motivates them to do or not do something.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former peers. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
Managers of this type have difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting performance reviews, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, is someone who transforms into an unfamiliar person, feeling that they want to change everything the team is doing and make it their own.
Even then, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior is often a result of rifts between leaders and the other members of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often serve as a point of contact with their immediate physical group.
Compared to members of a traditional team, they often have more autonomy because their team can meet according to different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"Invisible Team" is the management team to which each member reports. The Invisible Team sets standards for each member.
Does an organization want to go through the process that a learning organization takes to establish itself? The goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When an organization's functional departments effectively utilize all available resources, creativity and ingenuity can be communicated.
As a result, the organization's process starts working together to overcome an obstacle, which can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must build a culture of innovation along with shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes it as a method used to help organizations reach higher levels of performance with a continuum approach.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to investigating cognition, narrowing the scope of this research area and making it more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, stroke, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes in ways never before seen.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models, which helps us understand the process in our minds.
Although AI has a strong presence in science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in machines.
AI research involves creating machines that can automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, and scheduling, the ability to diagnose customers and answer questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and faces.
These things have become separate subjects, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in fields like economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being built into many home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any class. Often a teacher likes to take their students to places where bus travel isn't an option.
Technology provides solutions with virtual field trips. Students can sit with their class and see museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or appreciate beautiful art.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year the students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned each year, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with messy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Because students are often the most important audience, blog writers start trying to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to cater to the audience's interests motivates students to become clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs empowers students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to internet content, students can define their position in relation to the writing of others and also outline their own perspectives on particular issues (O'Reilly, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and a showcase of art galleries and museums that display Canada's past and present.
The far south is home to Niagara Falls, and the north, Muskoka and beyond, is home to untapped natural beauty.
These things and Ontario are highlighted as quintessentially Canadian by outsiders.
Further north, large areas are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited forests.
What may surprise many people when comparing populations: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in itself.
Most small islands are independent nations or are affiliated with France, and are known for their luxury beach resorts.
Islam was also brought to the land of Arabia, and it took over Comoros and Mayotte on a large scale.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, this region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female passenger say she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
Wearing rings can also be helpful (especially new ones that look very expensive).
A woman should realize that cultural differences can result in her believing in and adhering to customs that may seem like harassment to her; things like holding hands may not be unusual.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand on your own ground (cultural differences or new things, that's exactly what it is!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the Agora and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon Agora after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar al-Beida, and the agora was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants, who had established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and the whole spectrum of trinkets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located east of Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava flowing from the Nyiragongo volcano devastated Goma, blocking most of the city's roads and streets, especially in the central part of the city.
Even though Goma is largely secure, any travel outside of Goma should be undertaken with a good understanding of the situation, in order to be aware of the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province.
This city is a base for some of the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking in Africa, as well as for climbing Mount Nyiragongo.
It is possible to get around Goma using "boda-boda" (motorcycle taxis). The standard fare for a small vehicle is 500 Congolese Francs.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" began to be used as a metaphor for a foreign, faraway land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, the world heritage site of Aïr and Ténéré Reserves was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desert sand.
This was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
This city is quite unlike the other cities in the country; it has more of an Arab character than an African one, so to speak.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park is spread over 19,500 sq km and divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
This is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered a flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, the park has daily conservation and entrance fees.
A Wild Card can be beneficial for someone who wants access to a park of their choice in South Africa or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
Hong Kong's skyline-forming buildings have been compared to a magnificent bar chart, made more distinct by the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed along the northern coast, on reclaimed land.
This is the place where the British colonialists had their residences, and therefore if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Although largely a new mangrove swamp, the Agora contains some of the last remaining stands of mighty forest that once covered the Gangetic plains.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 sq km, of which approximately one-third is covered by water/swampy areas.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) all day, although most, especially those going east and those going towards Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
In most districts, small Japanese coaster buses run, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters in Agora.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs post is expected to be dismantled.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group who now live in eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco area was home to other groups of native peoples such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies", was born from the encounter of Spanish conquerors with native indigenous groups.
The Spanish started the colonial period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for being one of the best polo teams and having some of the best players in the world.
The year's biggest tournament will be held in December at the Las Canitas polo field.
Small tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and polo match tickets, see the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP) at a value of one to one.
The only bank on the islands where money can be exchanged is located in Stanley, across from the FIC West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere on the island, and within Stanley, credit cards and United States dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted on the outer islands, although British and United States currency may be taken; check with the owner beforehand to determine what methods of payment are acceptable.
Exchanging Falkland currency outside the islands is nearly impossible, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer reads.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons; the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to being seen by humans, they are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
It doesn't matter how docile they appear, bison, elk, moose, bears, and nearly all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they don't keep a proper distance. These animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, be aware that odor attracts bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous food items and maintain a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is on the island of Upolu, and its population is just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, America, and Britain refused to leave the port.
Except for one British cruiser, all the ships sank. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the assassination of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to the expansion of Auckland's two ports, there are many beaches. Of these, three beaches are the best.
The northern coast stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south, falling into the Pacific Ocean.
These sandy beaches are safe for swimming, and most have Pohutukawa trees providing shade.
Tamaki Drive is on the Waitemata Harbour, located in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
This is sometimes a crowded family beach with various shops along the shore; swimming requires caution for safety.
The main local beer is called 'Number One'; it's not a sophisticated beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. Other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines travel better.
Local tap water is generally safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
The idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians. A short black is an espresso, a cappuccino is tall with cream (froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Reef trips happen throughout the year, and injuries from getting stranded on a reef are rare for any reason.
Even then, take advice from authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes be found outside of this time.
Sharks are present, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are actively migrating in the sea, their primary habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives travelers the peace of mind knowing they will have a place to sleep somewhere new upon reaching their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping grounds, through your travel agent.
Travel agents commonly offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold a reservation for you if you need time to think about their offer or obtain other documents (such as a visa) to reach your destination.
However, any modifications or requests should be made through the travel agent first, and not directly with the hotel.
For some festival-goers, the vast majority of people attending the music festival decide to camp on site, and most attendees consider it a significant part of the overall experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should go early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the main stage music may have ended, there might still be parts of the festival where music will continue to play late into the night.
During some festivals, there are special camp areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin space, because there will be quite a terrible noise for those most affected by the passage through the ice.
A St. Petersburg cruise includes time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos typically make many attempts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exiting can be difficult.
To keep guests in good spirits and to keep them on the premises, they usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offers.
Some places serve alcoholic beverages at home. However, alcohol impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying calm.
Anyone driving or traveling by rail in high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
Friction is reduced on icy and snowy roads, and you can't drive like you would on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow to get you stranded can fall in a very short time.
Visibility may be restricted by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, many countries have normal icy and snowy conditions, and traffic flows mostly unhindered throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and are an attraction for many visitors.
In popular usage, the word safari refers to a trip, especially an overland journey across the savanna, to view the amazing African wildlife.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, come close to the cars, and standard equipment allows for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can sometimes be shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") involves hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics were held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events were held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the games in 1964, will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, then you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-related cancellation policies have been extended until the end of March, with some new ones extending until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will be priced between 2,500 and 130,000, with the typical ticket costing around 7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels offer irons and ironing boards for loan, even if they aren't present in the rooms.
If iron isn't available, or if you don't like wearing ironed clothes, then you can try using a hair dryer when available.
Be careful not to expose the fabric to excessive heat (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are various methods for purifying water, some being more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute may be sufficient, while others may require several minutes.
Filter effectiveness varies, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter insects and pests that they are not familiar with in their home region.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in even worse situations, cause allergies, spread poison, or spread infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill people, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is available in some places, offering the chance to buy goods exempt from excise duties.
Heavily taxed countries can sometimes allow travelers to save significant amounts of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated backwoods areas.
If you are new to driving on this country's roads, be wise about your capabilities: steep grades, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are common.
The posted speed limit is significantly lower than the preceding and following sections – typically 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to it is even more important than otherwise.
The funny thing is, though, Izzi mobile phone service is much stronger here compared to many other parts of the region, e.g., the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good, and in Bavaria, like its southern neighbor Austria, it is quite rich and diverse.
Mangoes are used in pastries, apples are baked in pastries year-round, and cherries and plums make their appearance during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but rich pastry, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
It is a dish based on herbs and spices, with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
With around 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing a vast diversity of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualifiers, the term essentially refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is a series of dishes simply seasoned, with dominant flavors of peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various fragrant spices.
A stirrup is a support for the rider's foot, hanging on both sides of the saddle.
It provides more stability for the rider, but safety concerns may arise due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting caught in it.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. Several safety precautions can be taken to reduce this risk.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Later, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have a safety bar that allows the stirrup leather to fall free of the saddle if dragged by a fallen rider.
Cochamo Valley - a major climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, featuring a variety of granite big walls and crags.

Downhill snowsports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding across snow-covered areas using skis or snowboards attached to one's feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity for avid enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers are from 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia in 1861 by Norwegians.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
This is related, but doesn't usually involve alpine style ski touring or mountaineering; the latter is done in steep terrain and requires very sturdy skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a long, even hiking path.
In good conditions, I can cover somewhat more distance than walking – but only rarely can the speed of cross-country skiing on prepared tracks without a heavy backpack be matched.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but is home to many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling from one country to another means going through visa applications and passport control many times.
However, the Schengen Zone functions to some extent like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay within this region, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen member country, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for what makes an object an antique. Some customs agencies define items more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies geographically, with age limits potentially being lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, although they are smaller than mass-produced items.
For the Sami people, reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood, and the culture surrounding the trade was also important for many people beyond just those directly involved in the business.

As an example, an American citizen in the Middle East might face a different situation compared to a European or an Arab.
Advice is merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The ideas presented were often cursory, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.

Rip current is the flow of water returning from the beach towards the sea, often concentrated in a channel or narrow area such as a break in a sandbar.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow becomes concentrated in certain deep sections, and can form a strong current in the deep water.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back will be more difficult than normal.
Try to aim for a target where you won't be caught again, and depending on your skills and what has been noticed about you, you might want to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock tends to come on faster than culture shock (it has a shorter honeymoon period), can last longer, and can be more impactful.
Travelers who easily adapt to new cultures may sometimes take longer to readjust to their own original culture.
After living abroad, when we return, we adopt new cultures and lose some of our habits and our domestic culture.
When someone goes abroad for the first time, they should probably be patient and understanding because they know that staying comfortable as a traveler in a new country requires a lot of adjustments.
People coincidentally think that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The Pyramid Sound and Light Show is one of the most interesting things in this area.
Right now, we can see all the pyramids in darkness, and before the show starts, we can see them in silence.
Usually, you always hear the voices of tourists and vendors here. The sound and light show was just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is established as a backdrop and narrator for a long story.
Scenes will be displayed on the pyramids and the various pyramids will be illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by no country and were most frequented; in 2020, sixteen were active.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, near the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
The second includes Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
It is a region located south of the Ellsworth Land Peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula disappears into the mountains and plateaus, then re-emerges to form the 360 km range of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, whether in the Sentinel Range, is home to Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, culminating at 4892 meters in Mount Vinson.
In a remote location, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, because you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to a satellite to make phone calls.
Services are often delivered by shipping, including pleasure crafts, joint ventures, and missions requiring remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about linking to this service.
Traveling and learning were a rapidly growing popular choice for gap year planners.
This school is especially popular with those who are about to drop out, as it allows them to withdraw a year before university without compromising their education.
In some cases, taking a gap year course abroad can actually improve your chances of returning to higher education in your own country.
Typically, there is a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great boating destination, with thousands of lakes in the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" and also thousands of islands in the coastal archipelago.
You will need a boat to navigate the islands and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any boat, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
In Finland, boating is a national pastime, with roughly one boat for every seven or eight people.
It is similar to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but more beautiful (for example, the agricultural figure in the Netherlands is between one and forty).
Most distinctive Baltic cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can travel to the historic city for a full two days, returning by plane at night and sleeping.
If you only go ashore using ship-sponsored excursions, you don't need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some travel brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map of Berlin, it is not located near the sea, and a city tour is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
This is nothing to be ashamed of; it is no different from the personal fears and dislikes of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help alleviate the fear that is based on the unknown or a perceived lack of control.
The courier company will be well paid to deliver the items quickly. Often, time is of the essence when it comes to urgent delivery of business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for immediate repairs.
Some routes have their own aircraft from big companies, but other routes are problematic for smaller firms.
If they sent the goods by air freight, they could land on some routes and it could take days to clear customs.
The only way to get it quickly is to send it as checked baggage. Airline rules do not allow unaccompanied baggage to be shipped without the passenger where you currently are.
Traveling by plane in first class or business class requires paying a good amount of money to get some special benefits (it would be even better if your company booked the ticket, that would be great).
Although it's quite expensive, roughly speaking, an average person can pay four times the normal fare for business class and eleven times for first class.
Generally, there's no point in looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airline companies know very well that a group of passengers can easily pay exorbitant prices to go anywhere comfortably, that's why they charge them accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistria Republic in eastern Moldova, which had its own government and currency but was not recognized by any member state of the United Nations.
Despite the failure of political talks, economic relations have been re-established between the two banks of the Dniester in Moldova.
The dominant religion in Moldova was Orthodox Christianity.

There are still many men and women alive who lived through that time here, and many who had loved ones killed or were made to work to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazi party.
Do not deface or scratch the site's structure with murals.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half the people prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.

If you display some basic courtesy, then the sudden outskirts of Pareci will quickly disappear.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is mainly heavily forested with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and it contains a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to a microclimate, diverse soils, and varying altitudes, it harbored a wide variety of plant communities.

Rare creatures such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wild cats, and snakes, as well as common species, can be found there.
When visiting the monastery, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries offer cover for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own lungi, especially one with brightly colored borders, you will receive a smile from the monks or nuns at the entrance.
In that era, men were required to wear trousers that covered their knees.
These are available for borrowing from the stock at the entrance, but the clothes aren't washed after every use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing this skirt. For men, one size fits all!
