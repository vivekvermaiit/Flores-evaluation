It not only confirms the idea that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely circulated, but also provides details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's feather color is light brown with a yellowish top or a carotenoid-like color from the inside.
The research also provides information on the evolution of wings in birds.
Because dinosaur wings lack a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but other wing features are present—barbs and barbules—researchers speculate that the rachis likely evolved later than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but instead for regulating or displaying temperature. Researchers stated that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of a juvenile, not those of a chick.
Researchers suggested that, although it's a young dinosaur's tail, the sample has a large feather and not a light feather like that of a chicken.

The effect the team was searching for is caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth, creating tides, similarly, the Milky Way Galaxy exerts a force on the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.
Scientists have succeeded in concluding that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory suggests that dark matter around a galaxy is established in a kind of halo around the galaxy, and it is made of very small particles.

Candidates can send representatives to obtain evidence of every part of the process. In the evening, under a specific procedure, volunteers count the votes under heavy supervision.

Deputy Inspector General DK Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused have been reported as Baba Kunjar, Bhota Kunjar, Rampro Kunjar, Ghaza Kunjar, and Vishnu Kunjar.
Superintendent of Police Chandrasekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their face covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Edikoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then, accused of murdering his son.
He is detained pending indictment and hearing, but any eyewitness identification could be compromised because his picture has been widely circulated.
That is common practice elsewhere in Britain, but Scots law works differently and the courts have viewed the publication of images as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are treading a dangerous path in publishing images etc. of victims."
The Crown Office, which has overall charge of the prosecution, told reporters that there would be no further comment at least until charges are brought.
According to this text, the document refers to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics apparently covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
When an agreement is signed, Israel demands an ongoing military presence in the valley for ten years, while the PA is only willing to concede that presence for five years.
During the additional pest control trial, shooters were closely monitored by rangers, as the trial was supervised and reviewed.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Incorporated, qualified volunteers were employed under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to NPWS Acting Director of Parks Conservation and Heritage, Mick O'Flynn, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Yesterday, the nine members of the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) were sworn in at Martelly.
In four years, Martelli has the fifth CEP.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed the resignation of the old CEC as part of a package of measures to take the country towards new elections.
The commission's response to Martelly regarding the protests against the government that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were caused by the failure to hold elections, some of which were supposed to happen in 2011.
Approximately 60 malfunctioning iPods and overheating cases have been reported, resulting in fires at a total of six locations and minor burn injuries to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said they were aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 more overheating incidents, which the company deemed "not serious."
The ministry termed the delay in the report by Apple in response as "extremely regrettable."
The earthquake struck in Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said that no damage of any kind had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami there either.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a bus of Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held them hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired on the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many prisoners have been released, and so far, at least six deaths have been confirmed.
Six captives, including children and the elderly, who had been freed, were reportedly Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the old woman's place as soon as she needed the restroom; Mendoza was shot.
But he followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, he began investigating child labor in his spare time.
Her research revealed that if a hormone was increased, it would accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Loona.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna has passed on to the two-mooned night. Beautiful and unique like her."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as scary as I am, maybe even more so... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
A poll of 1400 people before the 2010 federal election showed that opposition to Australia becoming a republic had risen to 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the poll want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extreme ends of the spectrum, 29 percent of people surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent say that Australia should never become a republic.
He had Olympic gold medals in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in the three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was doubtful due to his complaint.
He couldn't distract himself from the pain by playing sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Many people verified the invention using various hardware and software by the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of delivering water to Earth, along with organic material that could form proteins and be conducive to life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because a comet collision occurred with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his governorship earlier this year and last month signed a bill into law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
He is convinced to make a plan to become president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims helps airplanes fly on shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
To identify aircraft with maximum accuracy and provide pilots with more precise information, Air Traffic Controllers are abandoning the old ground-based radar technology and using satellite-based technology.
There will be no additional transport services, and ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and park and ride facilities will not be available at the ground.
Fears of a rider shortage have increased the possibility that the game will be pushed to be played behind closed doors without team support.
A study published in a science journal on Thursday reported on the formation of a new species of finch on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that these species arose in only two generations, even though it was thought that the process would take much longer due to breeding between the native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris, which arrived from elsewhere.
Gold can be transformed into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn with fine wire, which can be bent and folded. It can be made into a stick or wrapped in rolls.
It can be beaten extremely thin and alloyed with other metals. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to embellish hand-made illustrations in books called "Illuminated Manuscripts."
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline a chemical is.
The pH level of a tested chemical substance is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, and then, with clean, damp hands, rub them into the hair.
Your hands will react with the outer layer of the gum, which will feel strange and create a kind of stickiness.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet, connected to a drainage system similar to today's.
Traces of sewage drains have been found in the houses of Crete and Santorini, the Minoan cities of Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets; in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes parts of public bathhouses where men and women used them together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, it means you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and then immediately reflects it.
The satellite was sent via a rocket; scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To place a satellite or telescope in space, this large rocket carries it to a height of 100 feet.
The wheel has changed the world in an amazing way. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is much easier and faster transportation.
He/She bought us a train, a car, and many other transportation devices.
Below them are mid-sized cats that prey on medium-sized game, from hares to fawns and deer.
In the end, there are many small cats here (including small domestic cats) that eat very small animals like insects, rats, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of position. A specific job that a cat holds prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are highly social animals that live in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three related males, along with thirty or more females and cubs.
Being from a large family of sisters and daughters, women are usually closely connected to each other.
Lion groups operate similarly to wolf and dog packs; animals are surprisingly lion-like in behavior (but not like big cats), and are highly lethal to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, a tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
Like the lion, tiger, and jaguar, the leopard is in the same group (genus Panthera). These are the only four cats that can roar.
A cheetah's roar is not as loud as a lion's roar, but is more like a growl or a yelp.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals. They may catch rabbits, snakes, quails, and birds. All the animals that the ocelot hunts are usually smaller than it.
Scientists believe that Ocelots use their sense of smell to track prey, following the scent from where the animals emerge onto land in order to hunt them.
They have good night vision and can see well in the dark, and can also move stealthily and quietly. Ocelots survey the environment around them to find prey and then capture their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came (such as going to a mountain or river, or moving to a new island so they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so a new population will require different traits or adaptations than they needed before in order to become a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, but they still need the same adaptations as before.
As time passes, and the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they become less conspicuous and less distinguishable from the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants obtain their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and make clothes with plants. Many of the foods we eat are plants. Animals cannot survive without plants.
The Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
Its massive jaw was filled with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with even more teeth in the upper jaw of its mouth, meaning anything that crossed its path had little chance of survival.
We don't know for sure, but it might have a diet of carrion, large fish, and other crustacean-like animals, and it might even be a cannibal.
It attacked anything that entered the water; even a large dinosaur like a T-Rex couldn't compete with it.
While much of their food would have been familiar to us, the Romans had their own peculiar or unusually elaborate food items, including wild boar, peacock, snakes, and a type of dormouse called a dormouse.
Another difference was that poor people and women would eat sitting on chairs, while rich people preferred to eat together, where they would bring food and sit comfortably around it to eat.
Ancient Romans could not have included in their diet foods that arrived in Europe from Asia or America in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and the ancient Romans never even tasted turkey!
The Babylonians built a basic temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People used to bring offerings for the gods, and priests would try to fulfill the gods' needs through ceremonies and rituals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctum that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, distinctive minaret-like towers, called Ziggurats, were constructed as part of temple complexes.
The top of the tower was a special sacred place for God.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a home wasn't that important.
The Hebrew family spent most of their life in the open air.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the stores were just open and kept an eye on the street. Stone was used for the construction of the houses.
The land of Canaan had no large forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and that during a voyage further west, he found a verdant land (Greenland) and named it Greenland.
But even without this discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living here at that time.
Even though every country was Scandinavian, the people of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland had many differences in kings, customs, and history.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might understand that there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Even though something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The words written behind the Declaration of Independence were "Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is said that in its early life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that this indicator was only included as a label.
D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by "Vichy" French. These were French people who made peace with Germany in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in an assault called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture that is shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word "civilis," meaning "citizen," which is related to the Latin "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," and it indicates to some extent the number of people in a society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture, a long cultural footprint, and equitable distribution apply for the transmission of knowledge across many generations.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any associated historical evidence and fail to be recognized as a distinct civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, under the Articles of Confederation—the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government—Congress was merely an alliance.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary to enforce its actions, it relied on the authority of the states, which often did not cooperate.
He did not have the authority to abolish tax laws and tariffs between states.
Before an article could be amended, unanimous consent was required from all the states, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Along with the German national football team, the Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island country in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands, Japan is often called an "archipelago" based on its geographical position.
Taiwan traces its beginnings to the 15th century when European sailors, crossing the island, recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a shift in previous grain production methods and employing Chinese laborers for its rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912)'s army took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it recognized Japan's rule over Taiwan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, including the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many buildings on the complex's edges have been reconstructed to give tourists an idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size until the end of the analog film era.
It is still prepared today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited through digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is, technically, a bit of a misnomer, being 36mm wide and 24mm high.
This format's aspect ratio (divide by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) are equal to or approximately close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often taking abuse and enduring disrespect, is a simple guideline that creates principles of movement while maintaining a sense of order in a picture.
It explains that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersections of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united European states, despite differences in language and customs.
From the king to the common man, this power has had an impact on everyone.
A Christian principle is that wealth should be used to eliminate disease and poverty, and the church's financial capital is especially there for that purpose.
The central authority of the church in Rome had existed for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether its rule was being justly fulfilled.
Soon after hostilities began, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy of ending the influence of the military and state officials proved effective, even though this ban generally violated international law, which had been approved through numerous international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain has created an underwater tunnel in international waters to prevent any marine vessel from entering entire sections of the sea, consequently endangering even neutral marine vessels.
While the strategy had a limited response, Germany also expected a similar response regarding its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude of citizens and nations was generally pacifist and individualistic.
Having witnessed the horrors and brutality of war during World War I, nations expressed a desire to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each phase of China or each family that was in power was a specific dynasty.
It was also an unstable period of provinces divided among various royal families. The best-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During that period, fierce battles erupted between many emperors for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying in the struggle for the high seat in the magnificent imperial palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from non-democracy to democracy, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Following the revolutionary occupations, it was also open to applications from all men, allowing for the most potential and enabling success and achievement.
The same goes for the army, because instead of the army's ranks being under class, now they were under caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad took a deep interest in matters beyond this worldly life. He would go to a cave known as "Hira," located on the mountains of "Noor" (light), to contemplate.
He secluded himself in a cave, living there for a considerable time, which offers a very clear picture of the spiritual aspects of Muhammad (peace be upon him).
In the tranquility of a cave on one of the peaks in the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is isolated from the entire world.
In reality, it's not easy to find all of it, even though everyone knew it existed. Once inside the cave, it's completely isolated.
Nothing can be seen except for the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains surrounding the area. Inside the cave, only a small portion of the world can be seen and heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BCE, the Great Lighthouse is one of several massive tower structures built to honor a martyred pharaoh.
The Giza Necropolis, located on the Giza Plateau in Egypt's Nile Valley, or the "Ancient Cemetery of Giza," includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), numerous smaller tombs, various temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid of Egypt was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many other smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built for Khufu's wife and family.
Making an "upward arc" creates a V shape, and making a "downward arc" looks like the Greek letter mu or a semicircle.
Up means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start from the frog (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
An upstroke typically produces a soft sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more forceful.
Don't hesitate to mark your notations with a pencil, but remember that printed beaming indications are there for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
In a freight car, they traveled back to Paris, amidst a crowd of people making threats and uttering slogans against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage open.
In one place, a member of the mob hung the head of the royal guard, who had been killed at Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid for the U.S. imperialist war expenses in conquering the Philippines.
A large portion of the U.S. colonial administration's expenses and interest on bonds was channeled through Wall Street banking houses in the name of the Philippine government, and they were forced to pay taxes on it.
Absolutely, the surplus profit derived from the super-exploitation of Filipino people constitutes a core benefit of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the concept that created the order.
The High Middle Ages, a period in which festivals began to take place, generally refers to the era of European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries AD 1000–1300.
The High Middle Ages came after the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended in 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas, including technology-push or the notion that technology is paramount, ranging from tangible things to a binding consciousness, suggesting that human destiny is governed by the fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and its manifestation in technology.
Many explanations of technological outcomes share two common ideas: that technological development is above cultural or political pressures, and that technology results in "effects" on societies that are inherited rather than contingent on social circumstances.
For example, one might say that motor cars necessarily cause the creation of roads.
Although a nationwide road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, new production methods have been devised to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Owning many cars also leads to frequent road accidents, which in turn spurs new innovations in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism is a major element of cultural oppression, as written by authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In terms of Romanticism, geographical forms, individuals, and the customs and culture associated with that geography over time grew, and these, being more in tune with the place of society, were superior to laws applied by way of mediation.
In the same way that Paris is called the capital of contemporary secular fashion, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its existence as a center of pleasure began around 400 A.D. and lasted until around 1100 A.D.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned gifts like silk and spices because their prices were much higher than those offered in Byzantine markets.
This was the time when the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style remained at its peak during the mid-period of the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was largely influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. The Crusaders began using buttons to fasten clothes, which was a major development at the time.
Subsistence agriculture is a type of agriculture that is carried out to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses saved seed from crop seasons or other related methods on an ecoregion to increase yield.
Historically, a large number of farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this remains the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together people with similar mindsets who feel ignored by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can vary by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or the gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of practices.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and sayings.
One of the most common methods used to highlight the importance of sociology is to focus on certain unfortunate incidents of children who have been targeted due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, remaining unsocialized by elders as they grew up.
Children of this type are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children are kept captive by people (usually their parents). In some cases, the abandonment of children is due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant mental or physical disability.
Vulnerable children may have been subjected to abuse or physical violence before being abandoned or running away.
It is said of the Kaafi singers that some have raised animals, while others have lived in the jungle on their own.
When raised like non-human animals, a feral child will behave (within physical limitations) completely like a specially cared-for animal, such as having fear and indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a support that provides assistance to people who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are built into the software and are meant to question, prompt, and explain methods that might be difficult for a student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for many reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and harassment.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment devoid of nurturing, care, and education, yet they do.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system aims to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home where they were previously taken care of.
The internet connects masses and elements of interaction.
The various features of the internet lead to greater proliferation in terms of ease of use and accessibility.
For example, "learning" and "sociability" have been suggested as key motivators for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were identified as new promotional aspects through engagement and MAC cards when examining the reactions of website participants.
Video recording has guided important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that by accurately interpreting micro-expressions, it can be determined whether or not a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay "The President's Speech," pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess its veracity.
To the point that it suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, may also share such abilities in the interpretation of human behavior.
Research from the 20th century has proven that there are two poles of genetic changes: hidden and apparent.
Sexual selection incorporates new genetic variations, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
With each generation, the separation or recombination between two alleles transmits the forward and backward changes.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for primates with a human-like digestive system to meet their amino acid requirements from plant-based resources.
Even so, failure to do so has serious consequences: anxiety about moving forward, food shortages, and ultimately death.
The most readily accessible plant-based protein sources are found in leaves and seeds, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (insects, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
Considering all things, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as the Savannah chimps do today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of waking up unnecessarily during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep after a short time (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock in your sleep, it might be helpful to keep it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other bio-rhythm based options include avoiding drinking too many watery things (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) early on, sleeping, and being forced to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of unrest in their body and soul.
The less worry you have, the more life force will emerge. Every person has the capacity to achieve complete peace and tranquility.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing hindering us on the path to that goal is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but expanded through the Mahayana path of compassion and a wealth of Indian yogic techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini energy (a mythical energy) is awakened through Kundalini Yoga by means of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Tibetan focus is deity yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightened self-awareness is generated.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which fostered cooperation between the USSR and the USA. As the war ended, the conflicts between the countries' systems, practices, and cultures began to lessen.
Within two years of the war's end, former allies had now become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to continue for the next 40 years, and real battles would be fought through proxy wars from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize with the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became practically moot late at night after the Soviet Union invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties when 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using cargo ships to transport goods is still the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the sea.
The traditional role of the navy is to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One notable historical example of this was the WWII North Atlantic campaign, where the Americans were trying to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, particularly using U-boats, was trying to stop that traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have succeeded in conquering Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats were domesticated for general use in the Zagros Mountains of Iran approximately 10,000 years ago.
Ancient culture and tribes began providing them with easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats are commonly kept in flocks that roam hills or other grazing areas, and they are often monitored by herders, who are often children or young people, more commonly called shepherds. These grazing methods have been used for a long time.
The wagonway was built in Britain in the early 16th century.
Although wagon ways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to adopt a faster pace and pull a larger load than the even worse roads of the day.
Cross ties were introduced quite early to hold the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had an iron strip on top.
It became common practice that more wood was applied to the wooden wheel of the wagon because there was more iron on it.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete iron railway cars were introduced.
The earliest known mode of transportation was walking, with humans beginning to walk upright around 200,000 years ago with the advent of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors did not walk upright like Australopithecus habits.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus walked on two legs nearly seven million years ago.
We can live in an environmentally friendly way, we can participate in the environmental movement, and we can even become active activists to reduce trouble in the future to some extent.
It is like symptomatic treatment for many diseases; however, if we don't just want symptomatic solutions, but want to find the root cause of the problems, and we must neutralize them.
It is clear that due to the scientific and technological advancements of mankind, many changes have occurred in the world, and problems have increased due to the growing population and the luxurious lifestyle of mankind.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten, signed draft by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to Dunlap's printing shop.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made at night, which were called "Dunlop broadsides."
The document was first read publicly on July 8th by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlop broadsides that still exist are old, circulating copies of the documents. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about these birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with claws and toes, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Basically, all computers in use today rely on the manipulation of information that is coded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits for use in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not show up immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are common enough that it may not be diagnosed right away.
The clearest sign of internal poisoning may be open containers of medicine or the presence of poisonous household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The word bug is used in a formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
That word comes from the ancient acquaintance with the Manghan, who are jinn that possess humans to inflict suffering.
Bed bugs and kissing bugs are both nest parasites, living in the dwelling or lair of their host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which remains a significant neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS compared to men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise a child.
These couples can choose a plan to adopt children.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through scientific methods. In fact, this method largely guides scientific research.
It is not just an experience, but an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations, as well as to guide scientific investigation.
Naturalists and philosophers contemplated ancient texts and, in particular, the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language diminished, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific foundations.
Many rhythms found in physiology and behavior are largely dependent on the presence of underlying cycles and their production via biological clocks.
Adaptive changes, which are not merely responses to external sequential cues, have been documented for many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a free-running cycling period even in the absence of external cues.
The experiment with Hershey and Chase was one of the key concepts that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to incorporate into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, either marking the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or marking the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected DNA segment, and whether the affected cells are germ cells (cells that produce offspring).
Only germline mutations can be passed on to offspring, whereas somatic mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts interested people to visit natural areas with the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including the wild lives of plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the environment.
An example is visiting, taking pictures, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns and drive to their workplaces in cars, passing through other places whose destination is what they have now left behind.
Everyone is connected in some way to this dynamic transport shuttle, and to a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that the large carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from a stable state that has supported human evolution for the past 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you occasionally hear similar level complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do such complaints arise in migration systems, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are migration engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to study traffic flow because one cannot predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within reasonable limits. This allows for a reasonable consistency in traffic flow, which can be described statistically with minor variations.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections assist in the planning, design, and implementation of road and highway facilities.
Birds were the first animals to take to the skies. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Many insects have the advantage that they can fold their wings along their body.
It gives them a wide range of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought it was correct, but most people thought the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That sounds reasonable because it doesn't feel like the Earth is spinning, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries about 8 times more water than the next largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river on Earth, and in some places it becomes 6 miles wide.
20% of all the water that discharges from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The central Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone causeway of Pepi's complex continued into the Old Kingdom, no causeway of the Giza complexes was ever surpassed in its scale and architectural splendor.
The people of the New Kingdom in ancient Egypt were amazed to see the tombs of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country and the least populated country in the world.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official documents.
Italian is also an everyday language that is often used by those who work in the state, while Latin is mostly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as they can be found in native form in nature and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that what we are seeing is being transformed into another substance.
Alloys are basically a combination of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Indeed, things like silver and gold are also metals.
You may also have metallic compounds that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, that pencil was a friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as new methods of writing emerge, the pencil is being pushed towards less importance and use.
People now write messages on computer screens; they never have to get near a stencil.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when a new thing comes along.
A fusion bomb works on the principle of taking energy to combine multiple protons and neutrons to form a nucleus.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a mountain. The center breaks down again, then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they can break apart with a slight push or even without one.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The surface layer is approximately 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
They are thin under Maria and thick under highlands.
The slopes can be hit harder because there's crusty snow. This makes it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Motivation theories focus on exploring what makes people feel confident or motivated.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories shed light on aspects about certain people, what they want, what they do, and what things in their environment compel them to do certain things or not do them.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two attitudes can emerge as managers begin leading their former peers. One end of the spectrum involves trying to be "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting performance reviews, delegating responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the far end of the spectrum, there's an unrecognizable figure who feels they want to change everything and do it their way, contrary to what the team is doing.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
That behavior often creates a divide between the leader and the rest of the team members.
Real teams are held to the same high standards of quality as ordinary teams, but there are slight differences.
True team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate reporting group.
They are often more autonomous compared to traditional team members because their teams may meet according to different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a genuine "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The invisible team" is an administrative team where each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to undertake the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One aim of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the active departments of an organization, creative potential and skill can emerge.
As a result, the collaborative effort to eliminate the obstacle can lead to a new, iterative process to meet the user's needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must foster a culture of innovation along with creating shared knowledge of organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes continuous improvement as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides explicit evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition testing, thereby shortening the research portion and making it more accurate.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior provides scientists with assistance in their research.
It has long been said that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and traumas affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advancement of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and previously unseen processes.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to create an external model that helps us understand the processes in our own minds.
Although AI has a strong association with science fiction, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, handling behavior, learning, and understanding changes in a machine.
AI research involves incorporating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose customer issues and answer questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and faces.
These types of things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now widely used in fields like economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being incorporated into many home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a great part of any classroom. Often a teacher prefers to take their students to a place where there is no option to travel by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field trips. Students can sit in their classroom and view ancient artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or appreciate beautiful art.
Sharing reflections on the trip after a field trip and sharing the experience with future classes is a great way to reinforce learning.
For example, every year the students of Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capitol; each year the website is redesigned, but older versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often start their blog experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
While students are often critical audience members, the blogger starts trying to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also compels students to become more aware of the world around them. The need to satisfy the audience's interest inspires students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and motivates students to learn beyond the typical school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can empower students to become more "analytical and critical." By actively responding to internet content, students can determine their position in the context of others' writings and outline their own ideas on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital city and boasts a string of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north, Muskoka, and beyond that, the unknown natural beauty.
These are all the things, and more obvious Ontario-isms, that outsiders completely associate with Canada.
The large areas to the north are sparsely populated, and some are almost completely desolate.
For comparison of population, which surprises many: there are more African Americans living in America than there are Canadian citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest island and continent to date.
Many small islands are independent countries, or are affiliated with France, and are also known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to these lands as well, and it spread widely in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, it is bordered by Sahel, and in the south and west, by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that no woman should be compelled to relinquish her actual marital status and be referred to as married.
Wearing a ring can also be helpful (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they perceive as abuse, and chasing after it, taking things into their own hands, etc., is not unusual.
Be strong in confronting people, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it okay!).
Casablanca's modern city was founded in the 10th century BCE by Berber fishermen, and it was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city and renamed it Dar al-Baida, while Italian traders from Genoa, who had established a trading post there, called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for shopping.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan items such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole array of trinkets, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano devastated Goma, burying most of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma requires research to understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province.
The city of Niragongo is a base for climbing the active volcano, and also offers some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The typical (local) price for a ride is usually ~500 Congolese Francs.
Due to its inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for the exotic, a distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but despite this, its reputation has kept it a favorite for tourism, and it also has an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sand.
During Henry Louis Gates' PBS series on the unique wonders of the African world, it was one of the major obstacles.
That city is quite different from other cities in the country because its style is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-eastern part of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting wildlife.
It is South Africa's premier tourist destination and is considered to be the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there is a daily conservation and entrance fee here.
Purchasing a Wild Card can also be beneficial, allowing entry to selected parks in South Africa or all national parks across South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong region and is a place that attracts a lot of tourist attention.
Hong Kong's skyline design has been compared to a glittering bar chart, accentuated by the presence of Victoria Harbour's water.
To see the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
Hong Kong Island's urban development is heavily populated along the northern coastline, built on reclaimed land.
This is the place where British settlers established themselves, and if you're looking for evidence of the area's past settlers, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest contiguous mangrove forest, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) along the coastlines of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the jungle within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
While mangroves are not just mangrove swamps—they incorporate some remaining fragments of the great forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans is spread over 3,850 km², of which approximately three-quarters is water/swamp.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that the area now contains 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and approximately 30,000 deer.
Buses depart from the Inter-District Bus Station (across the river), although most, especially those heading east towards Jaccar/Mumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As the buses operating within the district are often full, it is advised to purchase tickets a few days in advance.
In many districts, small Japanese coaster buses operate, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana, across the Oyapock River.
Both towers reach a height of 83 meters, while the bridge is 378 meters long and its two lanes are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully open for use in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are also expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most prominent indigenous group, now settled in eastern Paraguay, who lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced rudimentary agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to indigenous tribes such as the Guaicuru and Payagua, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," emerged as a result of conflicts between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Andalusians initiated a colonial period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is widely known as one of the best polo teams in the world and for having some of the best players.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check with the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at one bank on this island, which is in Stanley, away from the West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere in the islands and in Stanley credit cards, and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are often not accepted on the outer islands, although British and American currency may be taken; check with the owners beforehand what form of payment is acceptable.
Exchanging Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands is almost impossible, so exchange it before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it is summer there, it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: Temperatures sometimes drop below freezing, and the combination of wind and humidity can make it feel even colder than what the thermometer reads.
There are no distinct "rainy" or "dry" seasons; the amount of rainfall remains consistent throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals are ultimately wild, and they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and vultures, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
It makes no difference how friendly they may seem, yaks, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, tourists get injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Additionally, be aware that scents attract deer and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and maintain a clean camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was established in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when warships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships had sunk, except for one British cruiser. Approximately 200 American and German lives had been lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, the paramount chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, was killed as a result of a peaceful gathering in the city.
Auckland has many beaches due to its two harbors divided by a long stretch of land. The most popular are in three sections.
The North Shore beaches (North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mostly sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many have shade provided by pōhutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are on the Waitematā Harbour in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in central Auckland.
These are sometimes beaches bustling with families, along with a row of various shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One'; it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps more widely available.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are worried, bottled water is readily available.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee being foreign is absurd. An espresso is a small black, a cappuccino comes with cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Numerous trips are made to the reef throughout the year, and it is rare for the reef to be damaged due to any of these causes.
Still, seek advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near the coasts from about October to April, particularly north of 1770. They may occasionally be found outside these times.
Sharks are present, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the sea with agility; their primary habitat is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that once they reach their destination, they will have somewhere to get some sleep.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels; however, booking other types of accommodation, such as camping grounds, may also be possible through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also reserve a room for you if you need some time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
Any amendments or requests should be communicated through the travel agent, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, a large majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on site, and most attendees consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to wake up early in the morning to get to the campsite closest to the music.
Keep in mind that while the main stages might be done with music, some sections of the festival might keep the music going late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic in winter, reserve a cabin, as the sound of moving through the ice is often very frightening for those susceptible.
St. Petersburg cruises also include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos typically make every effort to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and the way out can be difficult to navigate.
To keep the guests in good spirits and help them maintain that mood, they should be offered good food, drinks, and entertainment.
Some venues offer alcohol indoors. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers understand the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snowfall, blizzards, ice, or freezing temperatures.
Driving on an icy and snow-covered road has less traction, and you can't drive the same way as you would on clear asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck on the road.
Visibility can be restricted by snowfall, blowing snow, or condensation on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, in many countries, snowy and blizzard-like conditions are common, yet traffic mostly continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari likely attracts the most tourism in Africa and is a highlight for tourists.
The popular term for a land journey to see the amazing African wilderness, especially in the savanna, is safari.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, come very close to the cars, and the standard equipment allows for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or going "footing") consists of hiking for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 14th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at various locations in Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, your situation may be difficult.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-related cancellation policies did not extend past July 2020, when the Olympics were rescheduled, through the end of March.
It is expected that the price of most tickets will be between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with general admission tickets costing ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available upon request, even if they are not available in the room.
If an iron isn't available, or if you don't have ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Beware not to let the cloth get too hot (it may shrink, or in some cases, slightly burn).
There are different methods for purifying water, some more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in other areas, several minutes are required.
Filter effectiveness varies considerably, and you should be mindful of that; therefore, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may face issues with animal pest control because they are not familiar with it in their home regions.
Insects can spoil food, cause itching, or in a worse-case scenario, cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Epidemic diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can powerfully injure or kill people, do not usually occur in epidemics.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers going to countries with heavy taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on items like alcohol and tobacco.
Driving conditions are challenging on the Buffalo Petersburg Highway stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, which passes through isolated, wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on the country's roads, keep your wits about you: master steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp bends.
Posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in preceding and subsequent sections — typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and strict adherence to them is all the more important.
Surprisingly, though, mobile phone service here is more robust than in many other scratchy spots, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria, similar to its southern neighbor Austria, they are very rich and come in many varieties.
Fruit pastries are common, with apple pastries available year-round, and cherry and plum varieties appearing in the summer.
Many German baked dishes contain almonds, walnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often enjoyed with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try those called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, often containing meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "saucy" depending on the amount of liquid.
In northern India and the inland regions of Pakistan, dahi (yogurt) is commonly used in making various curries, whereas in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella that encompasses the diverse regional dishes found throughout the nation.
However, if used in addition to "more passing," the meaning of that word is a food originally from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Now present throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers the best flavors with simple seasonings, Javanese ingredients, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various fragrant spices.
The stirrup helps the rider, being on either side of the saddle.
They provide maximum protection to the rider, but safety concerns may arise due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting trapped in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse bolts. To reduce this risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
First, horse riders wear riding boots with a heel and a very narrow smooth sole.
After that, some stirrups, especially English stirrups, have safety bars that help release the stirrup from the leather if a falling rider pulls back on them.
Cochamo Valley, Chile's most famous climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America for its diverse granite big walls and cliffs.
These peaks include those that offer captivating views. From all parts of the world, mountaineers continuously forge paths through the seemingly endless, solid rock faces.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding on snow-covered terrain, either by sliding or by attaching a snowboard to one's feet.
Skiing is a great travel activity, enjoyed by many enthusiasts who are often called "ski bums," and they plan their entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
The concept of skiing is quite old — cave paintings of skiers are from 5000 BC.
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia in 1861 by Norwegians.
Skiing via backpacking: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to that but doesn't usually involve alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter of which is done on steeper terrain and requires sturdier axes and boots.
Think of a ski route as you would the same hiking route.
In good conditions, you'll be able to cover a little more distance than walking – but rarely will you achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on complex trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but contains many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to more than one country would mean going through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
The Schengen Zone, despite being a zone, functions as a single country in this regard.
As long as you reside within this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, after obtaining a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for separate visas for each Schengen member country, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal standard that defines manufactured goods as antiques. Some tax agencies classify items that are 100 years old or older as antiques.
The description contains geographical variations, where the age range may be lower in North America compared to Europe.
Handicrafts can be called antiques, even if they are newer than mass-produced items of the same type.
Raising deer is an important source of livelihood in Sami, and the practice of trading them, along with many other businesses, is also significant.
Even traditionally, not all Samejo people remained involved in large-scale livestock production, but continued fishing, hunting, and such, often calling the deer a spring animal.
Today, many Sami people work in modern commerce. In Sápmi, tourism is an important source of income.
Although the word "gypsy" is often used, especially by non-Roma, it is considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes of poverty and misconceptions about Roma people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may want to consult with your governments in addition to yourselves, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisories are only a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The ideas presented are often brief, general, and simple compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Bad weather can happen anywhere in the world, and it has different types that can vary depending on geography, topography, and other environmental conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are examples and effects of bad weather, similarly, thunderstorms, dust storms, cloudbursts, and cyclones are.
Regional and seasonal inclement weather conditions include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather risks affecting their area, as it could impact any travel plans.
Any person planning to visit a country considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for a 'hostile environment course' will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course will typically supplement commonly discussed issues with greater detail, often with practical experience.
A course typically lasts 2-5 days and involves role-playing, comprehensive first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are very rare.
Seafarers planning gender affirmation surgery abroad should ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The government has agreed to issue passports to those who have not specified a gender (X) or who have changed documents to match a desired name and different gender.
The desire of foreign governments to respect these documents varies similarly.
After the events of September 11, 2001, searches at security checkpoints have also become more intrusive.
Transgender people should not be expected to go through scanners with their genitals and identity exposed before surgery.
Rip current is a returning flow of water with waves breaking on the shore, often associated with a sandbar or similar locations.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is blocked at some shallower sections, and from there, rapidly accumulating deep water can occur from the existing current.
Many deaths occur due to exhaustion when people try to swim against the current, which is impossible.
Swimming backwards isn't more difficult than usual as you move out of the current situation.
Try to be in a place where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skill and whether you've been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock comes after the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is less) that lasts longer, and can be more distressing.
These travelers had an easy time integrating into the new culture but sometimes have a difficult time reintegrating back into their own native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adopted a new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people had patience and understanding, realizing that a traveler needs time to adapt to the customs of a new country.
People may not understand that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning to the country.
The Sound and Light show at the Pyramids of Egypt is very interesting for children in this area.

Scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have been claimed by several nations and have the highest concentration of bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the Antarctic Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which is home to the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the submerged caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, which is surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge into the higher plains, then reappear to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The highest mountain in Antarctica, Mount Vinson, at 4,892 meters tall, is located in the Vinson Massif, in the Sentinel Range, in the northern part.
In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, your only option may be a satellite phone.
A satellite phone is not usually a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside with a clear view of the satellite to make calls.
This service is mostly used by shipping, including recreational boating, and similar maritime navigation that requires remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider will be able to give you more information about connecting to that service.
For those planning a gap year, traveling and learning are increasingly popular options.
It is particularly popular among school leavers, allowing them to take a year out before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can actually improve your chances of transferring to higher education upon your return to your home country.
Generally, these educational programs have tuition fees for admission.
Finland is an excellent destination for boat trips. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," there are also thousands of islands in the lakes and coastal areas.
In the islands and rivers, you don't need a boat.
Although the coastal islands and largest rivers are certainly adequate for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
In Finland, boating with a boat for every six or seven people is a national pastime.
It is matched to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite distinct (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one to forty).
Many Baltic cruises include extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can sleep on a cruise ship overnight and spend two full days visiting the historical city.
If you are only going on a cruise ship excursion, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin and Germany in brochures. As you can see in the map above, the sea is nowhere near Berlin, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by airplane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic incident.
There's nothing to be ashamed of; it's no different from personal fears and dislikes of other things that many people have.
For some people, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that might stem from the unknown or a feeling of being out of control.
Courier companies are paid very well to deliver things quickly. Often, time is of the essence for business documents, goods, or spare parts for a quick repair.
On some routes, large companies had their own ships, but it was a problem for other routes and smaller organizations.
If they shipped the goods by air freight, it may have taken a few days to upload on some routes and clear customs.
The only way to leave quickly is to send the checked baggage. Airline rules do not allow them to send baggage without the passenger from where you entered.
Paying a lot for special treatment is the obvious way to travel first class or business class (even better if your company does it for you).
However, it won't be cheap: as a rough estimate, you can expect to pay around four times the normal economy class fare for business class, and eleven times more for first class.
Generally speaking, there's no point in looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on a direct flight from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a specific core group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of dollars for the convenience of obtaining quick and guaranteed confirmations on flights and charge fares accordingly.

Announcements on the metro are usually made only in Catalan, but announcements about unplanned disruptions are made in various languages via the automatic system, including Andalusian, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being arrogant, strict, and emotional.
While it's often just a flawed stereotype, the best way to get around in Paris is still to be on your best behavior, to act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will become all the easier to achieve.
If you approach Parisians with a little basic humility, their initial rudeness will quickly disappear.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily wooded, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and includes alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to its range of microclimates, varied terrain, and differing elevations, it harbors many popular types of plant communities.
That area is also a vast home to diverse species of animals and birds.
Rare wild animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, falcon, marten, wild boar, wild cat, and jungle fowl can be found there, along with many common species.
