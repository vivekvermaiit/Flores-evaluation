This only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but it provides details that fossils generally don't, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal had a reddish-brown color on the head and a yellow or yellowish-white color underneath.
This finding also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaurs' feathers lacked a well-developed shaft called a Rachis, but possessed other feather characteristics - Barbs and Barbules - researchers speculate that the Rachis is a revolutionary development compared to other feathers.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for thermoregulation. Researchers suggest that even though this is a juvenile dinosaur tail, the sample shows juvenile feathers, not the down of a bird.
Researchers suggest that although it is a young dinosaur pair, the specimen shows that it is not a small hatchling, but rather a juvenile.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and wounding more than twenty other people.

Light reflection and rotation are used to determine a star's Rossby number, which depends on plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is due to magnetic variations.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The reason for what the team is looking for is the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sculptor Galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
The theory suggests that the darkest objects in a galaxy are located in a halo around the galaxy, formed from very small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "very worrying and dangerous due to the very high mortality rate."
Dr. Mal thinks that perhaps some patients contracted the disease in the hospital, and at least two were hospital healthcare workers.
Within a year, one infected person could infect approximately 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB among the entire group of people infected with tuberculosis still appears low; in South Africa, out of a total of 330,000, 6,000 were infected with this disease at a specific time.

In France, voting used to be a traditional experience: voters would isolate themselves in a booth, mark their preferred candidate on a pre-printed ballot, and then put it in an envelope.
After verification of the voter's identity by officials, the voter deposits the ballot paper into the ballot box and signs the voter roll.
France's electoral law strictly codifies the electoral process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no paper packets are present at the start of voting and that no packets other than those from verified voters and the correct count have been added.
Candidates can transfer representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by staff under strict supervision and following specific procedures.

The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Buta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Ghaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
At the time the car crashed into them, there were three people inside the house, but none of them were injured.
While the driver's head was seriously injured.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed, but emergency services were allowed through via the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital, located in Great Yarmouth.
He was later placed at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Idikuya has been present in the Edinburgh Police Court for a long time, accused of killing her son.
He is in prison awaiting the start of his trial, but any witnesses who saw the event or any evidence will be eliminated because his pictures have been widely published.
In other parts of England, this is a common practice, but the Scottish legal system works differently, and the courts consider the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Dundee University Professor Pamela Ferguson notes, "It seems journalists are heading down a dangerous path if they publish photos of suspects and other things."
Prince's office, which is completely in the control of prosecutors, indicated to journalists that they should not make any further comments until at least something has been revealed.
This document should be referred to in writing regarding the border dispute, which wants Palestine as a basis for borders before the 1967 Six-Day War.
According to reports, other topics covered included the future status of Jerusalem, which is a holy site for both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a ten-year military presence in the valley once the agreement is signed, but the Public Affairs Office, or PA, agrees on a five-year presence.
The snipers' control test for preventing excess casualties is being closely monitored by the rangers, as the control and effectiveness of the test is being evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), eligible volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Callaghan, the Area Manager for Parks and Heritage with NPWS, four shooters were selected for the initial targeted shooting and comprehensive conservation and education operational program.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday to join the new nine-member interim electoral council (CEP).
This is the fifth CEP under Martelly in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission suggested the resignation of the former CEP as part of measures ahead of the upcoming new elections in the country.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Sometimes, violent protests have arisen due to the failure to hold elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.
Around 60 cases of AirPods misuse have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that this is the 27th device-related accident they have been informed about.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more incidents of iPhones overheating, which the company considered "not serious."
The ministry called it "genuinely disappointing" in response to Apple delaying the report.
The earthquake occurred in the Marina area at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday afternoon).
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management has said that no casualties have been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former employee of the Philippine police hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took the tourists hostage.
Ronaldo Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
So far, several hostages have been rescued, and the death of six has been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and adults, were released early, including a Filipino photographer.
The photographers then took the place of the elderly old woman who needed the lavatory. Mendoza had been hit by a bullet.
Lagangz followed in his father's footsteps and began his professional journey in the field of medicine.
He was trained as a gynecologist and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Lykken began investigating premature births in her free time.
His research shows that if the hormone is administered, it accelerates fetal lung maturity in the baby.
Xinhua news agency reported that state investigators recovered two flight recorder black boxes on Wednesday.
The wrestlers also showed respect to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first princess of Extreme. My first manager, Luna passed away from the two moons, just as uniquely beautiful as she was. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was weird like me... maybe even loved her more and miss her." "Hope she is in a better place."
Ahead of the 2010 federal election, 1,400 people voted, with opposition to an Australian republic growing by 8 percent since 2008.
The Prime Minister Julia Gillard's custodians said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the second princess Elizabeth.
In the poll, 34 percent share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the end of the vote, according to the survey, 29 percent of people believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent of people believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist gives up competing in the 100m and 200m freestyle and the three-time Commonwealth Games backstroke, but her fitness is doubted following her complaints.
He couldn't afford the necessary medicine to relieve his pain because he was banned from gambling.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, achieved the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Some people have confirmed the use of various software and hardware from Discovery, which was announced on the third day of February.
Comets may be a source of water delivery to Earth and organic materials that form proteins and help life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially the formation of Earth, because a long time ago, Earth was struck by comets.
Komo, 53, began his rule at the start of this year and last month passed a bill that legalized same-sex marriage.
He refers to those rumors as "political shrieking and foolishness."
He is expected to compete for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system of FAA claims to induce aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology and eliminates the old Ground radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to be more precise about the exact position of the aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There are no additional transit routes available now, and trains will no longer stop in Wombley. Furthermore, there are still no parking, park-and-ride, or drop-off facilities available along the route.
The transportation shortage has further increased the possibility that the game will be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Wednesday reported on the emergence of a new species of finch in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that new species have evolved in two generations, although there is a belief that this process takes longer, it occurred as a result of breeding between Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza.
Gold can be transformed into any kind of shape. It can be hammered into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn inside a thin wire that is twisted around. It has the ability to be hammered and rolled into paper.
It can be made extremely thin and gilded onto other metals. It can be made very thin and is sometimes even used in handmade photograph albums for embellishment, known as "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called a chemical pH. You can use red cabbage juice to demonstrate it.
The color change of cauliflower juice is related to acidic or basic (alkaline) chemical substances.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in a chemical test.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean, damp hands, shape them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layer, making you feel itchy and forming a kind of crust.
In every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, there was a flush toilet system and a complex wastewater system connected to it.
Wastewater systems have been found in homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
Satellites in space receive a signal and then immediately reflect it back.
The satellite was launched into space with the help of a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere sometimes distorts our vision and viewing.
This requires a large rocket, taller than 100 feet, to place a satellite or telescope into space.
Wheels have changed the world in an astonishing way. The greatest thing that tires have done for us is to make transportation easy and fast.
They gave us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are many levels of felines that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to wild goats and deer.
Ultimately, there are many small cats (including lazy house cats) that eat mostly countless small-appearing insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is the concept of appropriate placement, a specific task that each cat performs to avoid conflict with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups.
A pride consists of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and cubs.
As sisters and sisters-in-law within a large family, women usually have close relationships with each other.
The roar of lions affects wolves or dogs like a community; animals are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and are extremely deadly to their prey.
A well-trained athlete, a tiger can climb trees (even if not very well), swim, jump long distances, and has five times the strength of a strong man.
Tigers are similar to lions, wolves, and jaguars in that they belong to the same group (Genus Panthera). Of these four types of cats, only one roars.
A leopard's growl doesn't sound like the full roar of a lion, but rather more like a rumble, a series of yelps.
The American cougar likes small animal food. They will catch lizards, snakes, mice, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the American cougar hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that wolves and other wild animals track and find food by scent, locating them wherever they are.
They have good night vision and can move stealthily in the dark due to a reflective layer in their eyes. Wolves locate their prey by blending into the environment and then ambush it.
When a small group of living things (a small part of the population) becomes separated from its original population from which it originated (such as when it moves across mountains or the sea, or when it moves to form a new lake in a way that returning is not easy), they sometimes find themselves in a different environment than they were previously in.
The new environment has different resources and diverse competitors. Therefore, the new generation may need different adaptations, which were not previously necessary, for different opportunities or to become a strong competitor.
Overall, the core lineage has not changed; they still need to adapt as before.
Over time, as new generations began to adapt to new environments, they tried to appear less and less like the previous generation.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they will no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which aims to create new species. Speciation is considered an irreversible consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (breathe out).
Plants create their food through photosynthesis from the sun. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from bushes and our clothes from leaves. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
The Mosasaurus looked strange for its time, it feared nothing except other Mosasauruses.
Her massive jaw was lined with over seventy razor-sharp teeth and an extra set in the roof of her mouth, meaning nothing had any chance of escape.
We don't know for sure, but it probably had a barbed tongue. Its diet likely included shrimp, long fish, other mosasaurs, and even cannibalism.
Likewise, anything that entered the water was attacked; even large dinosaurs like the T. rex were identified as prey.
While their diet was very similar to ours, the Romans had strange or unusual items set apart for themselves, which included wild boar, ostrich, snails, and a type of mouse called a dormouse.
Another difference was that when poor people and women ate their food, they would sit on stools, while wealthy men had their own dining tables and sat beside them to eat.
The diet of the ancient Romans did not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had not tasted corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor pumpkins, nor even Turkish delights until now from the ancient Romans.
The Babylonians each built shrines to their gods in the primary temple, which was considered the house of God.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to reach the gods' desires through gatherings and celebrations.
Each temple had a large courtyard and a sanctuary that only monks could enter.
Sometimes, distinctive pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temple complexes.
The top of the tower was a special place to stay for God's sake.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, houses were not very important.
Many of the Heberw Family's lived their lives under the open sky.
The women were cooking in the courtyard, the shops had just opened, and they were sweeping the streets; stones were being used for building houses.
There are no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood is very expensive.
Greenland had a large population. In the Norse Sagas, it is said that Eric the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discoveries, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
While every country is "Scandinavian", there are major differences in the people, monarchies, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was written after the Declaration of Independence.
Actually, she is not right. While there are some things written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words written on the back of the Declaration of Independence, "The original date of the Declaration of Independence is July 4, 1776," this writing appears from top to bottom in the last part of the document.
While no one knows exactly who wrote it, it is known that prior to this, a large parchment document (measuring 29 ¾ by 24 ½ inches) had been rolled for protection.
So, it's likely that the indicator was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet liberated.
This was the "Vichy" French government. These were French people who made peace with Germany in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
August 15, 1940, the invaders entered Southern France, this invasion is known as "Operation Dragoon".
Scientific life, ecology, and cognitive neuroscience / last life, living firm in vairology. Provost, in just two weeks, American and Free French forces lost southern France's independence and turned to Germany.
Civilization is a single custom shared among a considerable group of people who reside and work collaboratively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," meaning civil, related to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and it also introduces a level of society in a way.
City-states predate nation-states. A civilized culture demonstrates an understanding of knowledge across several generations, making it a cultural and just phenomenon.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation—with Congress as its only branch.
The Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state officials, who often did not cooperate in enforcing its actions.
It did not have the power to abolish tax laws and tariffs between states.
Before making changes to this law, the countless consent of all the states is needed, and the states take the central government very lightly, to the point that their representatives are sometimes absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is considered one of the most successful teams in the world, and it also won the FIFA World Cup championship in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports in the northern regions are very popular, similar to Italian games, in international games and Olympic ceremonies.
Japan has approximately 7,000 lakes (the largest lake is Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest lake country in the world.
Possessing a group of "islands," Japan is sometimes referred to geographically as an archipelago.
Taiwan began its own path back in the 15th century when European sailors passed by the island, calling it Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, starting with the conversion and production of indigenous grains and employing Chinese laborers in its rice and sugar factories.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) exerted force to control the southern and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, it declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consisted of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
Since 1976, thirty percent of the Machu Picchu construction has been completed, and work continues on its construction to this day.
For example, the most common photo format in the world today is 35mm, which alongside the analog film era was a high standard for film.
It is still produced today, but the most important thing is the aspect ratio, which it inherited from the image of the digital camera's sensor formats.
The 35mm size is actually, somewhat confusingly, 24mm in width by 36mm.
This format's aspect ratio (divisible by twelve to get a simple whole number ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS family of formats) have this aspect ratio equal to or closely approximate it.
Taking civilized norms and regulations into consideration, a third of the people are subjected to excessive abuse and are often ridiculed.
This indicates that the most effective spot for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into three vertical and horizontal sections (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which was very wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For thousands of years, Christianity has kept European states bound together, despite their differences in language and customs.
This widespread electricity has affected everyone, from the king to the commoners.
One of the important principles of Christianity is that capital should be used to eliminate suffering and poverty, such that financial capital dedicated to the church should be available for this purpose.
The central power of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether the original purpose is still being achieved.
Following the outbreak of rebellion, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy proved effective in reducing military and civilian supplies on a large scale, while also violating many accepted international laws mentioned in numerous international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent all types of ships from accessing all parts of the sea, which affected even neutral vessels.
Given the limited reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response regarding its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude of many citizens and tribes was to remain in peace and isolation.
Having witnessed the horror and devastation of war during World War I, nations sought to prevent such a situation from occurring again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States to accept a job with Edison in New York City.
He arrived in the United States in his own name with four cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a very unique path for the period of time; China had a different empire in the time of each dynasty or anyone in power.
Similarly, the period of division between each dynasty was an unstable era. Among these periods, the most famous was the period of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During that period, heavy fighting for the throne took place among many nobles.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying in battles fought for the highest seat in the grand palace of Xi'an.
Here, there are very significant social and political impacts, for example, the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, or the shift in the country's people's beliefs away from being ruled by one person.
Likewise, post-revolution occupation was open to all male aspirants, allowing the most eager and capable to succeed.
It also becomes military-like because instead of the military ranking being based on class, it is now much easier and more lenient for them.
The French Revolution also influenced the backward people of other countries, and they too started revolutions.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond this worldly life. He would often go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" to contemplate.
He lived in the cave to survive during those times and to present a clear image of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Resting high in the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the outside world.
In reality, finding him is essentially easy even if one is aware of his existence, but once he is inside the cave, he is completely alone.
From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is one of the Seven Wonders that still stands in its place.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramid structures built in honor of the Pharaoh's dead body.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," consists of several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller shrines, several temples, and the Sphinx, in the Egyptian necropolis.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and smaller pyramids, shrines, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "raised bow" mark appears in the shape of a V, and the "lowered bow" mark appears as a line or square shape with the bottom part missing.
Up means you should start nodding and bowing, and Down means you should start from the chin (where your hands are held for reverence) and present it for bowing.
A bow usually produces a soft sound, while downstrokes are strong and more emphatic.
Feel the pencil comfortably in your hands, but remember the printed bowing marks for musical reasons, as they should usually be respected.
The dreaded King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie and four-year-old Louis Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced by the market women to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris amidst shouting crowds who made threats against the King and Queen.
The people's protest pressured the prince and princess to leave their house windows open.
At one point, a protester decapitated a royal guard and killed him in front of the terrified princess in Versailles.
The cost of the US imperialist war in subjugating the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were prepared to pay taxes to the United States colonial regime in order to be spared the greater part of expenses and interest on bonds from Wall Street banking houses in the name of the Philippine government.
Certainly, great profit was derived from the long exploitation of the Filipino people in order for the United States to benefit fundamentally from imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the order that inspired them.
The times in which this event occurred are generally referred to in European history as the Middle Ages, specifically the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages came after the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around the conventional date of 1500.
Technological determinism is a notion that flows from several practical ideas, from push technology or necessary technology to the precise sense that human destiny is derived from the fundamental logic that shapes laws and its emergence in technology.
Technological determinism's many interpretations generally share two ideas: that technological advancement follows a pathway of its own, largely beyond the influence of culture and politics, and that technology has "impacts" on societies, rather than being shaped by social conditions.
For example, one might say that the importance of cars leads to the development of roads.
While the national road network doesn't put economic progress solely in the hands of motorists, new production methods have emerged to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Excessive car ownership leads to road accidents, which in turn has spurred the creation of new techniques in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
From the writings of Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel, it is clear that Romanticism is a major element in the selection of culture.
Within the framework of Romanesque beauty, the people shaped by geography, and the traditions and culture that arose over time related to this geography, and which are in harmony with the place of society, were superior to arbitrarily enforced laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital in the modern world, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a major center of pleasure and luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
His situation actually collapsed due to the repayment of some of the Crusaders' gifts in the twelfth century, such as silk and some other goods whose value was much higher than that of the goods supplied in the Byzantine markets.
This happened at a time when the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Roman Byzantine traditions and customs in the West.
Whereas, due to a weak understanding channel, styles in the West lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe developed its own style, and one of the important developments was the use of buttons for clothing closures as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is farming in which a farmer produces enough food to meet the needs of themselves and their family.
Agricultural needs are a simple, often organic, system using the seed's original location relative to the main axis of the seed in conjunction with the agricultural axis, or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in agriculture for their economy, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who have been overlooked by societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can vary due to age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or the gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Subculture members often display their membership through their distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashions, morals, and behavior.
One of the most important methods that demonstrates the importance of socialization is how neglect, regret, or intentional mistreatment during several unfortunate incidents with children can paint young people as unsocial as they grow up.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children are confined by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the child's confinement is due to the parents' disapproval of the child's perceived mental or physical impairment.
Feral children may have experienced severe neglect or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
It is claimed that some animals have been domesticated; it is said that some live in the wild on their own.
Having been raised entirely by non-human animals, the fragile child exhibits behavior (within physical limitations) almost entirely like those of the specific caregiving animals, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier, practical work is a step further and more interesting.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a supportive tool to help individuals going through new learning experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both literal and figurative; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the paperclip helper in Microsoft Office.
Distance methods are embedded in the software and are intended to question, point out, and describe the procedures that a student might find challenging to manage independently.
Children are kept in foster care for many reasons, including to protect them from neglect, abuse, or exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment devoid of nurturing, care, and education, yet they do.
We view the foster care system as a place of safety for these children.
Our foster care system provides safe homes, caring guardians, stable schooling, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide all the needs that were not being met in the home from which they were removed.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions such as usage and methods of persuasion.
For example, "learning" and "social interaction" have been identified as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
When Iacobucci and Macord (1998) were investigating consumer responses to websites, they identified "self-relevance" and "ongoing contact" as new dimensions of motivation.
Video recording has enabled significant discoveries regarding the interpretation of fleeting facial expressions and movements that last for only a few seconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that understanding whether a person is lying or not can be discerned from interpreting facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay on the president's speech, points out how people who, due to brain damage, cannot understand speech are nevertheless able to accurately assess it.
He even suggested that the ability to interpret human behaviors might also be possessed by some animals, such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research shows that there are two types of genetic variations: latent and manifest.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes variation from the pool of expressed variants.
Mutations and recombinations cause variations to be shuffled among the collection of each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for herbivores to meet their amino acid requirements from available plant resources with digestive systems like those of humans.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth stunting, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant-based sources of protein would be leaves and vegetables, but for animals of the ape family like us, these are difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
Conversely, insect-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also provide a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Everything is noteworthy; we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" exactly like monkeys do in the deserts today.
Sleep interruption is a process of waking up voluntarily from normal sleep and going back to sleep after a short interruption (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively silent alarm clock that half-wakes you without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself synchronizing with the clock in your sleep, it may be on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other options for bedwetting involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces one to get up to urinate.
A person's inner peace is paradoxically directly related to the tension existing in the person's body and soul.
The less pressure there is, the more positive energy of life will exist. Everyone has the potential to have absolute peace and certainty.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has expanded thanks to numerous techniques from the Mahayana path of compassion and Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes the path of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and embracing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of spiritual awakening) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, repetitive chanting, and guided visualizations.
The deity of the Tibetan Yoga Center is Yoga. By bringing forth different deities in visual imagination, energy pathways are cleansed, chakras are activated, and a consciousness of spiritual awakening is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which paved the way for cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, systemic disputes, processes, and culture led to the collapse of countries.
Within two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
This war lasted for the next 40 years, and this conflict was fought in real terms and by proxy in battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and retreat and regrouping in the Romanian bridgehead area was the only hope.
However, these plans became apparent around nightfall when 800,000 troops crossed over from the Soviet Union and, in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral, after attacking Poland's eastern territories, formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republics.
Using ships to transport large quantities of goods and people by sea is the most efficient way.
The mission of naval forces has always been to ensure your country's ability to transport people and goods. Alongside this, they prevent the movement of your enemy's people and goods.
One of the most notable current examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans were trying to ship men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop this movement, mainly with the help of ships.
If the union had failed, Germany might have defeated Britain because the rest of Europe was with them.
It appears that humans first domesticated goats in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began protecting animals for easy access to their milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often tended by herders who were often children or young people, similar to a more widely known shepherd, and this method of herding is still used.
Railways in England were built so long ago, as early as the 16th century.
Although these railway tracks were made only of parallel wooden beams, their galloping horses could achieve greater speeds on them and pull heavier weights than on the few, more or less bad roads of that time.
Initially, many knot placements were identified to preserve the alignment of the survey lines. However, it gradually dawned on people that these routes would become more robust if iron rails were placed on top of them.
This method became common, but the iron rails quickly corroded the wooden sleepers.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete iron rails were introduced.
The earliest form of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means "upright man") about two million years ago.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not typically walk upright.
Although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs 7 million years ago, Australopithecus fossils show they had a distinct aptitude for bipedalism from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can become active in reducing the degree of suffering in the future.
This is often just like treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't just need a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem and deactivate it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed greatly due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and problems have become even greater due to overpopulation and human extravagance.
Following the approval by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten version was signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, and then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, which are known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the Declaration was done by John Nixon on July 8th in the yard of Independence Hall.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and it was read to his own forces on July 9th by his order. A transcript reached London on August 10th.
The Dunlop 25 unifacial transcripts known to exist are among the oldest copies of this document. The original signed version of the document has been lost.
Today, most archaeologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and continue to live today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can't fly.
But there are many things about birds that are similar to dinosaurs.
They have scaled feet and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Currently, all computers in use operate on the principle of data abstraction, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits - in the computer's own language.
It is not necessary that internal poisoning will be immediately obvious. Symptoms like vomiting are so common that they may not be immediately diagnosed.
The best indicator of accidental poisoning is an open container of medicine or the presence of poisonous household materials.
Check the chart for first aid instructions for those specific poisons.
The term bug is formally used by entomologists for insects of this group.
This term is derived from an old association with bedbugs, which are insects that live parasitically on the human body.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs are both widespread, having adapted to live in the home or nests of their hosts.
Across all of the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a major neurological disease in young adults and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or the child's best interest.
This couple may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In child adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can serve as parents to the child.
The main goal of science is to learn about the phenomena of the world through the scientific method. This method in fact guides most scientific research.
But this is not the only method; empirical work, and an experiment refers to a test through which one or more possible hypotheses are eliminated, questioning, and practical observations also guide scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient writings, especially the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas have been accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As Greek science declined, the West also found itself in a break with Greek philosophy and scientific roots.
Physiology, meaning the study of the body, and behavior rely heavily on internal bodily circuits and the products of biological clocks, according to most observations.
Circadian rhythms, which are not merely simple responses to external periodic cues, are documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are like self-sustaining oscillating mechanisms that, even in the absence of external cues, will maintain a free-running cycle.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was the guiding indication that DNA is the genetic material.
Viruses, or bacteriophages, were used to insert its DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, one with radioactive phosphorus labeling DNA in the parasite and the other with radioactive sulfur labeling protein in the parasite.
Mutations have varying effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material fragment, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only changes in the germline cells are transferable to offspring, while changes in other locations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who enjoy visiting natural areas to experience the scenery, including flora and fauna, and wildlife.
Examples of activities in the area include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits, and studying information about the environment.
In Borneo, a good example is to visit, photograph, and learn about Orangutans.
Every morning in the small rural towns, people go to their workplaces in cars, passing by people whose work destination is the same place they just left.
The transportation challenge lies in how everyone is connected to and contributes to a transportation system based on private vehicles within this driving system.
Science shows that this carbon-intensive economy has pulled the biosphere away from the stable state that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone integrates into society and benefits from the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality and bridge collapses.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there a more fundamental issue at play?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and vehicles and their interaction with each other individually between two points.
The unfortunate thing is that studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, most users have a consistent series of behaviors to a certain extent; as such, traffic patterns have a degree of uniformity and can be represented mathematically in a predictable way.
Three key relationships between traffic flow characteristics have been identified and proven: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections assist in the planning, design, and operations of road-related facilities.
Insects and animals were the first to fly in the air. The ability to fly helped them escape from enemies more easily and find more abundant food and breeding partners.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the sides of their body.
This gives them a wide range of hunting grounds to hide from hunters.
Today, the insects that cannot flap their wings are gnats, that is, sandflies and midges.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system, including the sun (and other stars), revolved around the Earth.
It seems reasonable, because the earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world and the largest overall. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the world's widest river, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
20 percent of all the water that flows from this planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The central Amazon River is 6387 kilometers (3980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed Giza in size or in the technical improvement of the structure.
The New Kingdom amazed Egyptians with the ancient historical heritage sites that were considered good in their time for thousands of years.
The population of Vatican City is 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Most of the employees in this department speak a daily language, also Italian, but Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Since ancient times, people have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper, because they can be found in their native state in natural places, and extracting them from the ground with primitive tools is relatively simple.
Aristotle, who was a philosopher, proposed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It resembled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to create what we see.
Steel is basically an alloy of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Obviously, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have diamonds that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit in a single point at the end of this sentence.
So, in this way, when the pencil came out, it was a friend to many people.
Unfortunately, as new methods of writing have emerged, the pencil has been relegated to fewer positions and uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, so they never need to sharpen a pencil.
One can only wonder what keyboards will be made of when something new comes along.
A fission bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to build a nucleus containing many protons and neutrons.
It is like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. The nucleus then splits again, releasing some of its energy.
The cores of some atoms are unstable, meaning they break down with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and soil. The outer layer of the moon is called the Crust.
The Earth's crust is approximately 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lowlands and thicker under the highlands.
There are likely many lava flows nearby because the crust is very thin there. Lava rises to the surface more easily.
Choice theory focuses on what people choose and what motivates those choices.
This theory proposes that people have certain needs and/or desires which are part of their nature, as they mature.
This concept explores what things motivate some people to want what they want and what things in their environment encourage them to do or not do certain actions.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
When managers start managing their former peer colleagues, two behaviors generally emerge. At one end of the spectrum, the manager tries to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, conducting performance evaluations, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, someone might transform in an unrecognizable way, feeling they must change everything the group has done so far and choose their own new path.
In any case, the leader is responsible for the group's success or failure.
Such behavior often creates rifts between leaders and the rest of the group.
Online forums are expected to maintain the same standards of excellence as traditional forums, but there are subtle differences between them.
On the internet, members of virtual groups often act as points of contact with their close-knit physical groups.
They have more autonomy than traditional teams because their teams may align across different time zones that their local management may not understand.
The existence of an actual "invisible group" (Larsen & Lafasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a special instance of a virtual working group.
A span of control is the group of people a manager directly supervises. A span of control sets expectations for each member.
Why would an organization choose a lengthy path to establish an educational organization? Setting a goal to implement the concept of administrative knowledge is an invention.
When all available resources within an organization are effectively utilized across all functional areas, creativity and innovation flourish.
Consequently, a collaborative process within an organization aimed at solving a problem can lead to a new innovative phase to meet customer needs.
Before an organization becomes innovative, its leaders must create a culture of shared knowledge and organizational learning alongside innovation.
The انجیل (Ingel) policy from 2006 describes how an organization takes help from the Continuum approach to achieve its maximum efficiency.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to exploring cognition, thereby refining the field of research and making it more precise.
Supports research with neuroscientists and behavioral scientists.
It has long been known that various types of damage, injury, trauma, and swelling to the brain affect behavior and cause changes in certain cognitive functions.
The emergence of new technology allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that were previously unseen.
This provides us with a great deal of information and tools to create training models in order to understand the processes that exist in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence evokes science fiction undertones, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Artificial intelligence involves creating machines in research that learn from intelligent behaviors and develop their own self-improving functions.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and questions by customers, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things require a separate discipline that finds solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and are also part of various computer and video game software applications in homes.
Field trips are a big part of every class. Losing this war is not an option.
Technology offers solutions for virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or appreciate fine art while sitting in the classroom.
Also, field trips are a great way to reflect on the journey and share your experiences with future classes.
For example, Bent School in North Carolina designs a website each year about a trip to the nation's capital; each year the website is created in a different format, but the previous versions are kept online as yearbooks.
Blogs also greatly improve students' writing. Even though students start their blogging experience with bad grammar and spelling, the presence of readers changes this situation.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blogger started trying to protect themselves from criticism.
It also states, "Students must be aware of the world around them," and there is a need to meet the intellectual curiosity and eagerness of their audience (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to online material, students define their place within the writing of others and also formulate their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming bilingual capital of Canada, and there is a range of arts and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Far south lies Nigeria, and to the north lies Muskoka, home to natural beauty.
All this and more showcase a uniquely Canadian side of Ontario that appeals to foreigners in particular.
Large areas in the north are sparsely populated, and some are barren deserts.
A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans living in America than there are Canadians in Canada.
The eastern islands of Africa are in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Referring to wildlife, Madagascar is the most biodiverse and unique large island continent.
Most of the many small islands are independent nations, or are affiliated with France, and they are called luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to these lands as well, and it was largely successful in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
From the north, this area is bordered by the coast. And to the south and west is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is suggested that women tell travelers they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Pointing out the ring will help (as opposed to asking about its high price).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may result in what they consider harassment and stalking, being touched, etc., is a common thing.
Be steadfast in bringing down the male, and do not be afraid of standing up for your land (cultural differences aside, this doesn't make it right!).
The foundations of the modern city of Casablanca were laid by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and it served as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids.
The Portuguese demolished it and then built it as Casa Branca, which they also abandoned after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt it under the name Dar al-Baida, and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who had established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places that has shops all over Morocco.
In the old part of the city called Medina, there are places that sell traditional Moroccan items like tagines, pottery, leather goods, pipes, and an array of various trinkets, but all of it is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda, in the far east.
In 2002, the Goma city was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered many of the city's streets, especially the central part of the city.
While Goma is relatively safe, any travel outside of Goma requires understanding the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province.
This city is used as a base before climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and, in addition, has some of the most affordable ways in Africa to see mountain gorillas.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The standard (local) fare for a short trip is 500 Congolese francs.
Despite being relatively inaccessible, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for strange and remote lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although it attracts tourists due to its reputation, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat from desert sand.
This was the most important stop during Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World" PBS special.
This city has a very clear distinction from other cities in the country because it has more of an Arabic flavor compared to an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and is bordered by the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different fauna.
This is one of South Africa's main tourist attractions and is the most important park managed by South African National Parks (SANParks).
For all South African national parks, there are conservation and entrance fees for each park.
This would be beneficial for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which grants entry to designated parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and is a place that many tourists consider a center of attention.
The Hong Kong skyline, with its assembled buildings, is likened to a sparkling festive chart appearing prominently from the waters of Victoria Harbour.
Leave the island and go to the opposite side to see the best views of Hong Kong.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land from the sea along the northern coast.
This is the place that British colonizers seized as their own, and so if you want to seek evidence about the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, stretching nearly 80 kilometers (50 mi) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest that falls within India is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangrove swamps, while—some of them comprise the last remaining stands of forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometers, a third of which is submerged in water/swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been called a safe haven for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave from the bus station (riverside) within the district throughout the day, especially those going east towards Jakar/Bumthang between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because buses traveling between districts are often full, it is a good idea to buy tickets several days in advance.
In most districts, small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy, provide service.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapok River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has a two-lane road 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
This bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the completion of the Brazilian customs post is anticipated.
The Guarani are the most important indigenous group who live a semi-nomadic life in present-day Paraguay and now practice agriculture and animal husbandry.
The Chaco area was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who subsisted on hunting, foraging, and fishing.
In 16th-century Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of the Indies," a hybrid society was formed as a result of wars between Spanish conquistadors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish started colonization which lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción has succeeded in preserving much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous in the world for having the best polo teams and players.
The biggest competition series of this year will be held in December at the Las Canitas Polo field.
Small series of competitions and races can also be seen here at other times of the year.
Check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo for tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is considered equal in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at one bank on the islands, which is located across from the FIC Western store in Stanley.
British Pounds are generally accepted everywhere in the islands, and US dollars as well as credit cards are often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are generally not accepted on the outlying islands, though British and U.S. currencies may be; confirm with owners what method of payment they accept.
It is nearly impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is now summer there, and conversely, it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
Montevido (areas close to and bordering the tropical zone) is in the subtropics; summer temperatures exceed +30°C.
The cold season can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to create a greater chill than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although animals in the park are mostly accustomed to seeing humans, wild life is still wild and they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from other wild animals!
It doesn't matter how docile they look, bison, elk, moose, bears, and nearly all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of people are injured due to not maintaining a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so stay in your place and leave them alone.
Be aware, however, that scents attract bees and other wildlife, so avoid handling or cooking fragrant foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This town is on the island of Upolu and its population is slightly less than 40,000.
Apia was established in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port governor refused to allow seven ships from Germany, the United States, and England, which were the site of a notorious naval power in 1889, to enter the port.
All maritime vessels were sunk, except for one British cruiser ship. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
The movement for independence efforts led by Mau was underway, and the peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the assassination of Tapua Tamasese Lealofi III, the paramount chief and most important leader.
Because Auckland lies on two harbors, it has many beaches. The most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbour ward) lies on the Pacific Ocean and extends from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most have pōhutukawa trees providing shade.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the suburbs above Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the seafront. Swimming is safe.
The most important local corn liquor is called 'Number One', and it's not some complex beer, but it's naturally pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines would be better during the trip.
The tap water is perfectly fine to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easily available.
Australians find the idea of a "plain white" coffee strange. They have 'espresso' which comes in a small black cup, milk coffee with a cap of cream on top (no froth), and they serve tea without milk.
The standard of hot chocolate is based on the Belgian standard. The fruit juices are expensive but very delicious.
Many small trips to the reef happen all year round, and damage is seen on the reef due to these factors.
Even then, seek advice from officials, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish, meaning box jellyfish, appear in the northernmost parts of coastlines and estuaries from October to April, since 1770. They are sometimes found outside of this time as well.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their central habitat is in the estuaries of rivers flowing into the sea, north of Rockhampton.
Reserving a place in advance gives the traveler peace of mind, knowing they will have a place to stay for the night when they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although it is possible to book a different type of accommodation with the help of a travel agent, such as a campsite.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or combined flight and hotel packages.
If you want to think about the offer or obtain additional documents (such as a visa) for your destination, they can also wait until you confirm the reservation registration for them.
Before checking into the hotel, all adjustments and suggestions should be shared with the travel representative.
For some festivals, especially music festivals, many attendees decide to camp on-site, and many participants consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should arrive early to choose a campsite location near the music.
Please remember that even though the music on the main stage may be over, there will still be a fair portion of the festival continuing, playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families and their young children.
Whether you're passing through the winter or the northern Baltic, check out the cabin space, because the passage over the snow creates a harsh, unpleasant noise for those most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises also include city time. Visa requirements are waived for cruise passengers (see conditions).
Casinos often go to great lengths to encourage guests to spend as much time and money as possible there. Usually, there are no windows or wall clocks, and finding the exit can be difficult.
They usually have special food, offer drinks and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits, and keep them at the forefront.
Some places give away alcoholic drinks for free. However, alcohol intoxication negatively affects decision-making ability, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone traveling in vehicles at high altitudes or in mountainous passes should keep snow, ice, or freezing temperatures in mind.
In snowy and icy roads, grip is low and you can't drive like you are on asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can accumulate in a very short time to trap you.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or snow on vehicle windows.
Conversely, in many countries, snowy and icy seasons are common, and traffic continues almost without interruption throughout the year.
In Africa, safari tours are perhaps the biggest tourism draw and are important parts of travel for many tourists.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to traveling across land to see Africa's fascinating wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, have a nature that makes them approach vehicles, and they can be observed well with standard equipment.
Leopards, cheetahs, and tigers are sometimes shy, and you will have a better view of them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "foot safari," or "hiking") involves walking on foot, lasting for several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some competitions will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having previously done so in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the suspension announcement, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but coronavirus-related cancellation policies have not been extended past July 2020, since late March, which was when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will range from ¥2,500 to ¥130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing clothes can help with wrinkles. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to borrow, even if there isn't one in the room.
If the iron isn't available, or if you can wear socks without ironing them, then you can try a hairdryer, if you have one.
Be careful not to overheat the patch (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burning).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in others it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have concerns, consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter such wild animals in their native region with which they are unfamiliar.
Mold spoils food, causes irritation, and in severe cases, causes allergic reactions, poisoning, or transmits infection.
Naturally occurring diseases, or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill people, do not fall under the category of plague insects.
Buying goods without paying taxes is an opportunity to purchase items in certain areas where goods are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes may save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway exist on the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont because this road repeatedly winds through remote and isolated wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on the country's roads, then you should be aware of: poor road conditions, narrow lanes, and sharp bends are prevalent.
Posted speed limits are significantly lower than preceding and subsequent sections—typically 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h)—and strict adherence to them is crucial.
The strange thing is that here, on this road, the mobile signal is stronger than on other long roads, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are better with coffee, and in Bavaria, like their southern neighbor Austria, they are quite rich and diverse.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples baked in pastries throughout the year, and cherries and plums making their appearance during the summer.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes are often enjoyed with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, then try one that, depending on the region, is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
"Saalan is a dish made with meat or vegetables along with herbs, leaves, and spices."
A stew or "Wucha" or "Lunda" can be, depending on the amount of liquid.
In the northern inland regions of India and Pakistan, adding yogurt to kadhi is common; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, using coconut milk is more common.
With a selection from 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that covers the wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the nation.
However, if used without the qualifier "superior", the term implies that the food originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available in the archipelago, simply consists of a series of seasoned dishes, with dominant flavor ingredients that Javanese people like: peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are footrests for the rider that hang on either side of the saddle.
This gives the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting trapped.
If a rider falls from a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, and the horse runs, they could be dragged. Several safety precautions can be taken to minimize this risk.
First, most riders wear riding boots that have a heel and a smooth, narrow sole.
Also, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety stirrups that, if the leathers are pulled backwards, allow the rider to fall free.
Cochamo Valley - an important rock climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, has varied types of granite cliffs and rugged terrain.
Its peaks include spectacular scenery. Climbers from all over the world are constantly forging new routes on the seemingly endless, imposing wall.

Skiing is a major travel activity where the holiday plans of many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums," revolve around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old — skiers appear in cave paintings from around 5000 BC.
Skiing down a mountain as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring and ski mountaineering: This activity is known as ski touring, ski tourism, or ski trekking in remote areas.
It pertains to that, but it doesn't usually include Alpine-style skiing or mountaineering. Mountaineering is done on specific routes and involves sturdy boots and firm ground.
Imagine a ski track, like a very long hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover more distance than walking – but unless you are carrying a heavy load on your back and are on well-used trails, it is rare to backcountry ski fast.
Europe is a large continent that comparatively has small but numerous independent countries. Generally, to travel through numerous countries, you are required to get stuck multiple times at visa application and passport control locations.
People in the Schengen Zone, in any case, operate as if they were one country.
As long as you reside in this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to pass through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, thanks to holding a Schengen visa, you are not required to apply for a visa to each Schengen member country, so you save time, money, and paperwork.
There is no comprehensive definition for what constitutes manufactured goods as antiques. Some tax authorities consider goods that are more than one hundred years old to be antiques.
This definition has geographic variations, where the age limit might be significantly lower in some places, like America, compared to Europe.
Handicrafts consist of antiques, even if they are much younger than the advent of mass production.
Raising common carp is an important livelihood in the Soomi and surrounding culture; trade, along with other professions, is also important for many.

The ideas presented are often more superficial, general, and oversimplified than detailed information.
Severe weather is a general term that can be used for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or potentially lead to loss of human life.
Dangerous weather can occur anywhere in the world, and it has different forms that are related to geography, topography (i.e., characteristics of the earth's surface), and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes.
Regional and seasonal heavy weather phenomena include rain and snow storms, blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the severe weather conditions affecting the area, as they may impact travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that could be considered a war-torn area should consider obtaining professional training.
An internet search for "eco-friendly courses" might give you the address of a local company.

A course will typically take 2-5 days and will include map reading, extensive first aid, and in some cases, weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with desert survival are common, but publications about war zones are rare.
Travelers intending to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.

The consent of foreign governments regarding the acceptance of these documents is unstable.
After September 11, 2001, security searches at checkpoints became much more intrusive.
Transgender people should not expect to pass through scanners with privacy and dignity before the operation.
Breaking waves are returning waves that collide with a coastal outcrop or similar object on the shoreline.
Due to the underwater geographical situation, the Return Current is concentrated into several deeper sections, and a rapid wave in deep water may form from there.
Many deaths occur as a result of exhaustion when they try to swim back against the current, which can be an impossible thing.
The sooner you get out of the current situation, the less difficult it will be to swim back to normal.
Aim for a place where you won't be trapped again, or, depending on how good your skills are and whether or not you've been noticed, you can wait until you are rescued.
Re-entry shock comes on faster than culture shock (the honeymoon period is much shorter), lasts longer, and can be more intense.
Travelers who find it easy to adapt to new cultures sometimes face great difficulty readjusting to their own local culture.
When you return from living abroad, you have adopted a new culture and lost some habits of your own home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably more patient and understanding with you, knowing that travelers need time to adjust in a new country.
People may not expect this patience, and understanding is essential for returning travelers.
The Sound and Light show at the Pyramids is one of the most fascinating things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Generally, you always hear the voices of tourists and vendors here. The story of the sound, the fire, and the light is like a storybook.

Scenes are performed against the backdrop of the pyramids, and various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are subject to territorial claims by various countries and host a high concentration of military bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The entire archipelago lies 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, home to the Villa Las Estrellas settlement.
Included are Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a still-active volcano has created a fascinating natural harbor with geothermally heated pools.
The southern part of Ellsworth Land is an island surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the Tapoza mountains merge into a plateau, then rise again to form the Iles Warth mountains' 360-kilometer range, carved by the Minnesota Glacier.
The Sentinel Range in northern Antarctica contains the continent's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, with Vinson Mountain's 4,892-meter peak being the highest of all.
In remote locations, with no mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, because to make calls, you need a clear line of sight to the satellite outside.
Services are often used through leasing, including the art of pleasure, along with trips that require remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service will likely give you more information about the service agreement.
For those looking to plan a gap year, travel and study is an increasingly popular choice.
This is especially popular with school leavers, allowing them to spend a year abroad before university, rather than compromising on their education.
In many cases, taking a year out to study abroad realistically increases your chances of returning to your home country to pursue higher education.
Generally, these educational programs have tuition fees for enrollment.
Finland is a great destination for boating. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," there are thousands of islands in the lakes and coastal archipelago.
You don't need a small boat in the islands and lakes.
Although the coastal peninsula and large lakes are undoubtedly big enough for any boat, smaller boats or kayaks offer a different experience.
In Finland, rowing is a national pastime, with each boat having about seven or eight people.
In Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand it is the same, and on the other hand, it varies (for example, in the Netherlands, the figures are from one to forty).
Most Baltic Sea cruise ships offer extended stays in St. Petersburg.
This means that you can visit this historic city for two days. You need to return to your ship to sleep at night.
If you only disembark onto the shore from a cruise ship, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some brochures in Berlin, Germany mention sea voyages. As you can see, the map of Berlin above shows it's nowhere near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced trauma related to flying.
This is not something you should feel ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and hatred of other things that many people have.
For some people, having some understanding of how an airplane works and what happens during a flight may help alleviate the fear that is based on the unknown or not being in control.
Courier companies make good money to deliver things quickly. In most cases, time is very important for business documents, goods, or spare parts for an emergency repair.
In some cases, larger companies have their own airplanes, but in other cases smaller companies had problems with referrals.
If they had shipped the goods by air cargo, it is possible that it would have taken many days due to unloading and customs in some ways.
The only way to expedite things was to send it as registered baggage. Airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where your role comes in.
The affordable way to experience flying in first or business class is to accumulate some points for a reward (or, even better, have your company pay for it).
But it's not cheap: according to rough rules of thumb, you should keep in mind that you might pay four times as much as the economy level for business class, and eleven times as much for first class.
Generally, there's no point in looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on a direct flight from point A to point B.
Airlines know there is a specific core group of travelers who are willing to pay a premium for the advantage of arriving a little faster and more comfortably, and they charge them accordingly.

Observatories from pre-modern times are now generally abandoned, remaining as museums or educational sites.
Because the light density wasn't as much of a problem during their peak, they are generally in cities or campuses, making them easier to return to than those built in modern times.
Modern research telescopes have created countless opportunities in remote areas with excellent weather conditions.
The viewing of blossoming cherry trees, known as Hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.

Many cultural churches often hold Easter Vigils on Saturday night during Easter week, with churches often celebrating the resurrection of Christ around midnight.
All the animals arrived at these lakes by swimming, flying, and walking in the water.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, swimming animals could not make that journey, so the first grazing animals in the Galapagos were tortoises.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, many invasive species have been introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in the winter, you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
