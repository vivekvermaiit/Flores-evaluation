In late 2017, Siminoff appeared on the television shopping channel QVC.
Ring also settled a lawsuit with a competing security company, the ADT Corporation.
To date, there is one experimental vaccine that reduces deaths from Ebola, but to date, no drugs have shown clear suitability for the treatment of an existing infection.
One antibody drug, ZMapp, initially promised progress in the field, but formal studies have shown it offers fewer benefits than desired in preventing deaths.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as the control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by a step forward with meaningful change in our organization, rather than the deprivation of certificates.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that may shed light on the proportion of abuse so heroically described by the survivors of Larry Nassar that went unnoticed for so long and involve any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOPC have the same goal – to make the sport of gymnastics, among others, as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as his advisor and then joined the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.

This not only confirms that there were at least some dinosaurs that had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but also offers details that fossils generally cannot, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal has chestnut-brown feathers on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, also known as the rachis, but did have other characteristics of feathers - barbules and barbs with barbules - the researchers inferred that the rachis was possibly a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The feather structure suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggest that, even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not a chick's down.
The researchers suggested that even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows mature feathers and not chick down.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.

They found that the Sun works on the same basic principles as other stars. It was found that the activities of all stars in the system are driven by their brightness and rotation and nothing else.
The brightness and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

The Iraq Study Group presented their report today at 12:00 GMT.
It warns that no one can guarantee that any course of action in Iraq at this point can stop sectarian warfare, growing violence, or a slide into chaos.
The report opens with a plea for open debate and the formation of a consensus in the United States regarding policy towards the Middle East.
The report is highly critical of almost every aspect of the current decision of the Chief Executive Officer towards Iraq, and it calls for an immediate change of direction.
The first of their 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of the year to strengthen Iraq's borders against hostile interventions, and to reaffirm diplomatic relations with its neighbors.
Current senator and Argentine First Lady, Christina Fernandez de Kirchner, announced her presidential candidacy last night in La Plata, a city 50 kilometers (31 miles) outside Buenos Aires.

The work being done is mostly theoretical, but the program is written to simulate observations that were made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the Milky Way's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing the tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a pull on the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most dark matter around a galaxy is found in a type of halo and consists of very small particles.

Dr Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new cultivar was "very highly disturbing and alarming due to the very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have picked up the germ in the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and at least two were healthcare personnel from the hospital.
In a year's time, one infected person will infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
Although, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still appears to be low; 6,000 out of the total 330,000 people who are infected at any specific moment in South Africa.

All cave entrances, known as "The Seven Sisters", are at least 100 to 250 meters (328 to 820 feet) in diameter.
Infrared images show that the temperature variations between night and day suggest that they are most likely caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding environment during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as moderate as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a reasonably constant temperature, but it is consistent with these deep holes in the ground," says Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting was traditionally a low-technology experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, and then put a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the candidate of their choice into an envelope.
After officials confirmed the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law has quite strictly codified these proceedings.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes were present at the beginning of the election and that no envelopes were added except those that were counted and cast by registered voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evenings, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, according to specific procedures.

Her other race, the Giant Slalom, saw her finish in tenth place in the sitting women's group with a combined run time of 4:41.30, 2:11:60 minutes slower than the first-place athlete, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09:02 minutes slower than the ninth-place athlete, Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's group failed to complete their runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to rank in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phones.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop.”
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car impacted it, none of them were injured.
Therefore, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred is temporarily closed while emergency services rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized in the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting her charge and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be influenced because her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish legal systems work differently, and courts have viewed publication of the photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "journalists cross a dangerous line if they publish photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is in overall control of prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made, at least until indictment.
The document, according to the informant, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle Eastern War.
Other topics reportedly being covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow such a presence for only five years.
Rangers closely monitored marksmen in the supplementary plague control trial, as the trial was monitored and effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, the Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS, the four selected marksmen received comprehensive safety and training instructions for the first shooting operation.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission suggested the previous CEO's resignation as part of a package of measures to move the country forward to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's reaction to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some of which were already overdue since 2011.
Around 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
METI announced last week that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's removal of the report "truly a pity."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands emergency management office has stated that no damage has been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been reported dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman as she needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He studied to be an obstetrician and started working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature births in his spare time.
Her research showed that, if hormones are administered, it will accelerate the baby's fetal lung development.
Xinhua reports that the state's investigation team recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said “Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager Luna died on the night of two moons. Very unique just like her. Strong woman.”
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “Luna was just as weird as me… maybe even more so…loved her and will miss her…hopefully she's in a better place.”
Of the 1,400 previous voters from the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic have grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the poll share this view, they want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was called into question.
He couldn't use the medicine he needed to overcome his pain because it was banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware or software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may possibly be a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets originate, especially how the Earth was formed, given that comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as political chatter and foolishness.
People are speculating that he will make a bid in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of liters of fuel annually and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport is available, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and drop-off/pick-up facilities are not available on the grounds.
Fears about a loss of transport have increased the possibility that the game will be played behind closed doors and without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the species adapted in only two generations, even though this process was believed to take much longer, due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can also be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted or braided. It can be hammered out or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then press them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, it will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, and it was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of drainage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women socialized together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back, almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light and our vision.
It takes a giant rocket of over 100 feet tall to put a satellite or telescope into outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has given us is much easier and faster transportation.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Among them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey such as hares and buck.
Lastly, there are many small cats (including roaming pet cats) that eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche; each cat has a special job that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups known as prides.
Lion prides consist of one to three related males, together with as many as thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related to each other, essentially a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave a lot like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (even if it's not good at it), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar isn't like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a string of piercing, screamed words.
Small wild cats like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the wild cat hunts are smaller than they are.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and find animals (prey) through smell. They sniff the ground to find out where the animals have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and also move unseen. Leopard cats hunt their prey by blending in with the environment and then pouncing on their victims.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is removed from the main population they originate from (such as when they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily retreat) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were previously in.
The new environment has different resources and different competition, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than they previously needed to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed much; they still require the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population began to adapt to their new environment, they started to look less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will differ so much that they cannot even be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide that people breathe out (that is, exhale).
Plants make their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build our houses and to make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to live.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw has more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning there is no escape for anything that crosses its path.
We don't know for sure, but it is possible he had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would be no match for it.
While much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own share of strange or unusual feasts that included wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of marsupial known as a Hazel Dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the women ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men preferred to hold banquets where they lay on their sides and ate their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas, or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was regarded as the home of the deity.
People would bring offerings to the gods, and the priests would try to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner chamber that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, also enough ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life happened in the open air.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were just open counters that looked out onto the street. Stones were used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. Norse sagas tell that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there.

If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Nevertheless, that is not true. Even if there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4th, 1776". The text appears upside down, at the bottom of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, it's possible that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that subsequently broke out liberated the north of France, but the South was still not free.
It was controlled by the "Vichy" French. They were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, an invasion known as "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the American and French forces liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people who cooperate and live and work as a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or like a city, and it also defines the size of the society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilized culture thrives on the transmission of knowledge across many generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and equitable distribution.
Smaller cultures regularly disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government – with Congress as its only component – under the Articles of Confederation.
The congress did not have the power to enforce taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, they relied on the state authorities, who often refused to cooperate, to carry out all their acts.
It also had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were frequently absent.
Italy's national soccer team, along with the German national soccer team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup winner in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the Northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of almost 7000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago" due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has.
Taiwan's history began long ago in the 15th century when European sailors passed by and recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in indigenous grain production practices by employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing dynasty (1644–1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which they ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have already been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size towards the end of the analogue film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio was inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equivalent to or closely approximate this aspect ratio.
The much-abused and frequently mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates movement while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the picture vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was placed under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian faith has bound European states together despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its all-pervading power affected everyone; from the king to the community members.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the financial resources of the church are specifically for this reason.
For more than a thousand years, the central authority of the church has been in Rome, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question this premise.
Shortly after the outbreak of unrest, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective; it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international laws through various international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering large parts of the ocean, which would mean danger even for neutral ships.
Since there was limited reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of indicating different time periods; each stage of China or each family in power was a separate dynasty.
There was also, between each dynasty, an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which took place in the 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasties.
During these periods, there was fierce warfare between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in Ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to sit in the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not to one sole ruler.
After the Revolution, professions were also open to male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military, as military ranks are now based on calibre, rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in events beyond this earthly life. He regularly visited a cave that became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has long survived, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world and rests on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In truth, it's not easy to find, even if one knew it existed. When one is in a cave, it's complete isolation.
Nothing but the clean, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of this world can be heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures built to honor the death of the Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "caret" mark looks like a V and the "breve" mark looks like a little staple or a small square without its bottom side.
Up means that you must start at the tip and press the bow, and down means that you must start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bow usually creates a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to enter your own notes, but remember that the printed staff lines are there for a musical reason, so they should normally be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to flee back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of market women.
In a wagon, they travelled back to Paris while surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and screaming threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the protesters swung the head of a royal who was killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were prepaid by the Filipino people themselves.
They are forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to resolve a large portion of the expenses, and the interest on bonds was floated by Wall Street banking houses in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits obtained from the protracted exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic profits of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The era in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological impetus or the technological imperative in a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic coupled with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most critiques of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, produces "effects" on society that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor car necessarily led to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a handful of cars, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass vehicle ownership also leads to accidents on the road, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for the repair of damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a significant element of cultural determinism, taken from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the physical environment shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture arose that were connected to that environment, and these things, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily-imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
The status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, the value of which was higher than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries, and in the 14th century.
The clothing was initially strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
Due to the slow communication channels, styles in the west can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Closer to the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of the time was due to the Crusades, which led people to start using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that is done to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that combines heirloom seeds native to the ecoregion with crop rotation or other relatively easy techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers were involved in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Individuals with similar feelings of neglect by community standards are brought together by subcultures, and allowed to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinctive because of the members' age, ethnic origin, status, location, and/or gender.
The characteristics that clearly define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture regularly indicate their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of styles, which includes fashions, manners, and informal language.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is by focusing on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, adverse circumstances, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Such children are labeled as "runaways" or feral. Some feral children are caged by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment is due to parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical limitations.
Feral children may have experienced serious child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
It is claimed that others were raised by animals; some lived on their own in the wilderness.
When a feral child is raised entirely by non-human animals, it exhibits behavior (within physical limits) that is almost entirely like that of the particular caregiving animal, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals who are starting to use a new learning method, such as a new computer program or the start of a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are in the software and are intended to question, accelerate, and clarify procedures for students who would find the process difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but that is the reality.
We see the foster care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
When Eighmey and McCord (1998) investigated audience reactions to websites, they identified "Personal involvement" and "Ongoing relationships" as new motivational aspects.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretations of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is mentioned that one can tell when a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his document, The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks indicated how people who were unable to understand the speech due to brain damage were nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behaviour are shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century showed that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation process adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variation back and forth between the two pools in each generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plants that are available there.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant sources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but it also offers high-quality protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their own "protein problem" in a way similar to that of some chimpanzees on the savanna today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and then falling back asleep after a short while (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself setting the alarm clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic), before bedtime, which forces you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses correlates to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the stress, the more positive life force is present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded through the Mahayana path of love and through many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, led by the USSR and USA. With the end of the war, clashes of system, process, and culture led to the countries falling out.
Within two years of the end of the war, former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It was the last for the next 40 years and would actually be fought, by proxy troops, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Bridgehead.
However it may be, these plans became obsolete overnight, when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after entering the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic expedition of WWII. The Americans attempted to get crews and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mostly used U-boats, tried to stop the traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would very likely have been able to conquer Britain, as it had been able to conquer the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were commonly kept in herds that roamed the hills and other grazing areas, and were looked after by goatherds who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known shepherds. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wasps were being worn in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagons mostly consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to do so at greater speeds and with larger loads than it would take to do so on the nearly coarser roads of the day.
Crossbeams were put in fairly early to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realised that the tracks would be more effective if there was a strip of iron on top.
It has become common practice, but the iron caused more wear to the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first pure iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transport was walking; people started walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not normally walk upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus already walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more kindly towards the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to combat future suffering to some extent.
It's like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However that may be, if we are not just looking for a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems, and we must neutralise them.
It is clear enough that the world has changed a lot due to mankind's scientific and technological advancements, and problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and mankind's excessive lifestyle.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on the site of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are known as the oldest copies of the document that still exist. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that still resemble a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms like vomiting are common enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or household chemicals.
Refer to the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for the group of insects.
The term is derived from an ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both Assassin bugs and Bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in a nest or home of their host.
Across the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most prevalent neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research finds that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their baby.
With an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple may adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through a scientific method. This method effectively guides most scientific research.
Although it is not alone, experimentation, and an experiment in a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and taking observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology, and behavior is often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only responses to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will maintain a period of free-running cycles, even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to inject their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments that labeled either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other locations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the environment, including the plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit Borneo and learn about orangutans and photograph them.
Every morning, people leave the small towns in cars to go to their workplaces and are passed by others whose workplace is the area from which they have just departed.
In this dynamic shuttle, everyone is in some way connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science indicates that this massive carbon economy has affected the biosphere's stable conditions that have supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, a study of traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within a reasonably consistent range; and thus, traffic flows have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the 3 main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of pavement facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid their enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back against their body.
It offers them a wider variety of small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems logical, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
New Kingdom ancient Egyptians were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City's population is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the daily language used by many who work in states where Latin is regularly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, and these can all be found in nature in their basic form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements, namely earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he had a theory that they could change into new forms that we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys can also exist that contain small amounts of non-metal elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in that period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many when it came out.
Unfortunately, the pencil's status and usage have diminished as newer writing methods have been adopted.
People now write messages on computer screens and don't need to go near a sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's almost like pushing a heavy wagon up a hill. The splitting of a nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they break apart with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70km thick on the near side and 100km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the oceans and thicker under the highlands.
There might be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around what motivates or satisfies people.
These theories assume that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
These theories examine what it is about certain people that causes them to want the things they do, and the things in their environment that cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of behaviour can emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. One side of the spectrum is to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, to carry out disciplinary actions, to evaluate employee performance, to assign responsibilities, and to hold employees accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels as if he or she must change everything the team was doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often causes a rift between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams meet across different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization go through such a time-wasting process to establish a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across functional departments of an organization, creativity and prudence can emerge.
As a result, the organization's processes work together to overcome the obstacle, and this can lead to a new innovation process to serve the customer's needs.
Leadership must create a culture of creation, as well as shared knowledge and organized study, before an organization can be innovative.
Angel (2006) explained the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of work performance.
Neurobiological data offer physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Thus, it narrows the research area and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior assists scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, traumas, tears, and tumors affect behavior and, in some cases, alter certain cognitive functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes as never before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models to help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong connotation with science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, which deals with behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now regularly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military units, and is also built into various home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. A teacher often wants to take her students to places where a bus trip isn't an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a good way to reflect on a field trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state's capital. Each year the website is redesigned, but old versions are kept online and serve as a scrapbook.
Web journals can also help to improve students' writing ability. While students often begin their web journal experience with messy language and spelling, the presence of observers usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the web journal writer strives for improved writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to feed the crowd's interest inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
A blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to take learning far beyond the traditional school day.

Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and contains a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and the surrounding area.
All these things and more characterize Ontario as what is truly considered Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans residing in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent on its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it took strong hold in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (as long as it's one that doesn't look expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences might cause them to feel harassed, and that it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when you turn men away, and don't be afraid to stand up for your rights (Cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it again after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the less interesting cities to shop in in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as Moroccan tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole spectrum of excesses, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the town's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside Goma should be researched to understand the ongoing state of fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the jumping-off point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to explore Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished town, even though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the dangers of the desert sands.
It was one of the main stopping points during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has more of an Arabian flair than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the north-eastern part of South Africa and follows the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a "Wild Card" which grants access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong territory its name, and it is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a dazzling bar graph accented by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best scenes of Hong Kong, leave the island and travel to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers took for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world and extends 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into the Bangladesh and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that falls within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just halophyte swamps - they include some of the last remaining stands of mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered in water/swamp areas.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now approximately 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading in an easterly direction, depart for Jakar/Bumthang between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is suggested that one buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese Coaster Buses, which are reliable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters and are 378 meters long, with two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational on schedule in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are also expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most remarkable indigenous group who inhabited the area now known as Eastern Paraguay, and they occupied the area as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the skirmishes between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish started the period of colonization which lasted for three centuries.
Since the creation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official Falkland Islands currency is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere in the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and United States dollars are also frequently accepted.
In the remote islands, credit cards will most likely not be accepted, although British and United States currencies will be taken; ask the owners in advance to determine what the accepted method of payment would be.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the environment is nevertheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from bears, wolves, and 25 meters away from all other wild animals.
No matter how tame they appear, buffaloes, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, thousands of visitors are injured because they did not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British warship. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the death of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the fact that Auckland stretches across two harbours. The most popular ones are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming spots, and most have shady areas provided by the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
Sometimes there are jam-packed family beaches with a good selection of shops along the edge of the beach. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is ‘Number One’; it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines available, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better to transport.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A short black is 'espresso', cappuccino is served piled high with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is on par with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips are undertaken to the coral reefs throughout the year, and injuries to the coral reef due to any of these causes are rare.
However, take advice from authorities, obey all notices, and heed safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside of these times.
Sharks exist, but very rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't actually live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind knowing that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, even though you may find it impossible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the bookings for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or inquiries must go through the travel agent and not directly through the hotel.
For some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees decide to camp on the grounds, and most see it as an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that although music on the main stages may come to an end, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
When crossing the Northern Baltic region in winter, be sure of the hut's location, as it causes a great noise for those most affected to pass through the ice.
Saint Petersburg boat trips include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (verify the terms).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits may be difficult to find.
To stick to their starting point and to keep guests in a good mood, they usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication affects your judgment, and all good gamblers realize the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving over mountain passes at high latitudes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-freezing temperatures.
Friction on icy and snowy roads is very low, and you can't drive as if you're on a bare tar road.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall quickly in a short amount of time to trap you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or windblown snow or by condensation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist draw in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The popular term safari, which is widely used, refers to an overland journey to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get too close to cars, and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "walking safari", or going for a "walk") consists of a hike lasting from a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, after having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to June 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes makes them dry faster. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to borrow, even if there isn't one in the room.
If an iron isn't available or you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the material get too hot (otherwise it may shrink or, in extreme cases, be scorched).
There are various ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others, a few minutes are necessary.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal diseases with which they are not familiar in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with violence, do not usually qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods, exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, where it frequently ventures into desolate inland terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, keep your distance: steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves prevail.
Speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections – usually 35-40mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Oddly enough, the cell service is better here than in many other parts of the route, e.g., the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite delicious, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbors, Austria.
Fruit pies are common, with apples being baked in pies throughout the year, and cherries and plums making their appearance during the summer months.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often well-paired with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but rich pastries, try what, depending on the region you're in, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish that is based on herbs and spices together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is common in curries; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional dishes from across the nation.
However, when used with further qualifiers, the term tends to refer to food originating from the central and eastern parts of mainland Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available across the archipelago, is characterized by simply flavored dishes, with the prominent seasonings being peanuts, chilies, sugar (specifically Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are for supporting the rider's feet, hanging on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability for the rider but can pose safety risks due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a horse throws the rider off and his foot gets stuck in the stirrup, he can be dragged along if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, there are several safety measures that can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup leather to come off the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - the largest climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and boulders.
Mountain summits offer breathtaking views of peaks. Climbers from around the world are constantly searching for new routes among the endless rock faces.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to one's feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old — cave paintings from as far back as 5,000 BC depict skiers!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity can also be called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is related to that, but does not include alpine ski touring or mountaineering, the latter of which are done on steep terrain and require stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you'll cover somewhat greater distances than walking – but only very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack in neat tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would have meant going through visa applications and passport control points multiple times.
The Schengen Zone nevertheless functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Having a Schengen visa means you don't have to apply to each of the Schengen member states separately, saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what makes manufactured items antiques or not. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antique.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products may be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to others with many other occupations.
Even traditionally, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but survived by fishing, hunting, or similar industries, and mostly used reindeer as draft animals.
Many Sámi people nowadays work in modern crafts. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you want to visit is subject to a travel warning, your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance may be affected.
You are also welcome to consult the advice of states other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisories are only a brief summary of the political situation in one country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, broad, and oversimplified compared to the more extensive information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, excessive rain, and wildfires are forms and consequences of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include severe snow driven by strong winds, heavy snowfall, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area as it may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for "hostile environments course" will most likely turn up the address of a local company.
A course would normally cover all the issues discussed here in greater detail, usually with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 to 5 days and will include a role-play, lots of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgeries overseas should ensure they have the valid documents for the return trip.
The eagerness of governments to issue passports where gender is not indicated (X), or to update documents to match a desired name and gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to comply with these documents is just as erratic.
Searches at security checkpoints also became more intrusive after the September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transsexual people should not expect to go through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the return flow of waves that break off the beach, usually at a reef or similar feature.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is more concentrated in a few deeper parts, and a rapid rip current towards deeper water may form there.
Most deaths happen as a result of exhaustion when one tries to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to move somewhere where you won't get trapped again, depending on your skills and whether you were noticed, and perhaps wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock arrives sooner than culture shock (there is less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapted to the new culture find it difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return after living abroad, you will have already adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first went overseas, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust in a new country.
People should not expect that patience and understanding are also very necessary for travelers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness, and you can see them in the silence before the show begins.
Usually you hear the sound of tourists and traders. The story of the sound and lights is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is presented as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with 16 active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of House of the Stars.
Others, including Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Antarctic Peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula merge here into the plateau, and then reappear in the 360km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range has Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, which peaks at 4892m - Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without cell phone reception, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not a common replacement for a cell phone because you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is regularly used by seafarers, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information regarding connecting to the service.
A growing popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular with school leavers, and allows them to take a gap year without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, by enrolling in a gap year program overseas, your chances of getting into higher education back in your homeland are higher.
Typically, there will be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great boating destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelago and lakes.
Even though the coastal areas' archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boat trips are a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is in line with Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in Holland the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises usually include extended vacation stays.
This means you can visit the historical city for a few days while returning, and sleep on the ship in the evenings.
If you go ashore and have used your on-board excursion, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some pleasure boat trip brochures included Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the tour price.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before, or if they have had a traumatic experience in the past.
This is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears or dislikes of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how something works on an airplane and what happens during a flight may help overcome the fear that is based on the unknown or not being in control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Quite often, time is of the essence when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or replacement parts for an urgent repair.
The larger companies had their own planes on some routes, but it was a problem for the other routes and smaller firms.
If they send these goods by air freight, the offloading and customs clearance can take days on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, so that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class is to pay a large sum of money for the privilege (or better yet - have your company do it for you).
Therefore, it is not cheap, however: as a rough rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare and eleven times the first class fare!
Generally, there's no point in even looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of getting to a destination quickly and comfortably, and they price accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.

İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The modern, developed, and busy commercial center built around the massive bay and surrounded by mountains, was once the ancient city of Smyrna.
The wide walkways, glass-facaded buildings, and modern shopping centers equipped with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches give the city more of an atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.

Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the wonderful Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place of worldwide famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave, and that this place has almost immeasurable value for a large portion of the world's population.
There are still many living men and women who survived their time there, and many more whose loved ones were murdered there or worked themselves to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the area by scratching marks or graffiti into the structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, and the vast majority understand it, and everyone knows basic Spanish.
Anyway, most signs are only indicated in Catalan, because it is legally recognised as the first official language.
Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the Metro are only made in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
While this is usually just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to be on your best behavior, by acting like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). This will make it considerably easier to get along.
Parisians' attitudes will change drastically when you act politely towards them.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, mostly with Beech, Spruce, and Fir trees, and is characteristic of mountain and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities due to the range of microclimates, different soil types, and varying altitude levels.
The area is also home to an incredibly wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, European wildcat, wild cat and black grouse can be found there, along with many other more common species.
During visits to the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees, and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most of the monasteries offer robes to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colours, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Within the same guidelines, men are expected to wear trousers that cover their knees.
It can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after every user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing the skirts. One size fits all men!
Majorcan cuisine, similar to that of the same zones in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and any other available ingredients such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie for 'jy' (you), always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.

Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete these days, and remain in use as museums, or teaching sites.
Just as light pollution wasn't the kind of problem it is today in their heyday, they aren't usually found in cities or on campuses, and they are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the Imperial Court.

Many traditions surrounding the holiday have already been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of staying up all night on Easter to watch the sunrise from some exposed vantage point.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is quite possibly a pre-Christian Spring and Fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter All-Night service on Saturday night during Easter weekend, with congregations frequently breaking out in celebration at midnight to commemorate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands either swam, flew, or drifted.
Due to the long distances from the continents, mammals are unable to undertake the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of mankind in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, as the sky is almost always dark.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore not often a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work ethic is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
