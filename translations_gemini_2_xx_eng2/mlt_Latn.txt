USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by making progress with significant changes within our organization, rather than by decertification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how the abuse, described so courageously by the survivors of Larry Nassar, went undetected for so long and embraces any necessary and appropriate change.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal — to make the sport of gymnastics, and others, as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowered environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory already, but provides details that fossils generally cannot give, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists state that the feathers of this animal were chestnut-brown in color on top and the bottom is light or carotenoid-colored.
The discovery also provides information about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but do possess other feather characteristics — "barbs" and "barbules" — researchers deduced that the rachis was likely an evolutionary development that occurred after these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not the soft, fluffy feathers of juveniles.
The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not downy fluff.
A car bomb exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

They found that the Sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system was found to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversal.

He warns that no one can guarantee that any action taken in Iraq at this point will stop the sectarian war, the escalating violence, or descent into chaos.
The report begins with a call for open debate and the formation of a consensus in the United States regarding policy towards the Middle East.
The report strongly criticizes almost every aspect of the Executive's current policy regarding Iraq and urges an immediate change in direction.
The first of his 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of this year to secure Iraq's borders against hostile interventions and to re-establish diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to stimulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon has a pull on the Earth, causing tides, so too does the St. Anne's Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory states that the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a type of diadem and is made up of many small particles.
Television reports show white smoke coming out of the plant.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming because of the very high fatality rate."
Dr. Moll thinks that some patients may have caught the bug from the hospital, and at least two were hospital healthcare workers.
Within a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still appears to be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any particular time in South Africa.

The outbreak led the Indian government to implement measures such as deploying pig catchers in severely affected areas, distributing thousands of mosquito nets, and spraying pesticides.
Several million vials of the encephalitis vaccine have also been promised by the government, which will help in the preparation of health agencies for next year.
Plans to deliver vaccinations to the areas most historically affected this year have been delayed due to lack of funding and low prioritization compared to other diseases.

Infrared sensors show that temperature variations from night to day indicate that they are likely caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as constant as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with them being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed paper slip indicating their candidate of choice into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the list of voters' names.
French electoral law codifies procedures in a rather strict manner.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except those of voters who have been duly counted and authorized.
Candidates may send representatives to witness any part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, according to specific procedures.

Her first event was the Slalom, where she got "Did Not Finish" in her first run. 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
In her other race, the Giant Slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch who took first place and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary who came in ninth place.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom did not qualify in the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterwards, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then, accused of killing her son.
She remains in custody pending charges and prosecution, but any eyewitness testimony may be influenced because her photograph has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts view the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "journalists appear to be entering dangerous territory if they publish pictures etc. of suspected individuals."
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made at least until indictment.
The document, according to the disclosure, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics covered reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is requesting a continued military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA is only agreeing to allow this presence for five years.
Pest control trial shooters had to be closely supervised by forest rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP (Provisional Electoral Council) in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEO as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, which were sometimes violent, were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due in 2011.
Around 60 cases of damaged iPods due to overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said it had been informed of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said there were no reported damages in the nation.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A Filipino person and former police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle in the direction of the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to use the toilet. Mendoza was killed by firearms.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
When he was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that administering a hormone accelerates lung maturation in the baby's fetus.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, government investigators found two 'black boxes' that are the flight recorders.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Truly one of a kind like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as unusual as me...maybe even more than me...I love her and miss her...hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard maintained that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
34 percent of those who participated in the survey agree with this view and would like Queen Elizabeth to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the voting, 29 percent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was expected to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, there were doubts about his state of health.
He couldn't take the necessary medication for his pain because they are banned by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software until the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of delivering water to Earth, along with organic matter that could form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, began governing earlier this year and signed a bill into law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "words and political stupidity".
It is speculated that he will present a candidacy for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older, ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No extra transport is being provided and overground trains will not be stopping at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on site.
Fears of transport shortages have raised the possibility that the game may be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" provided a report on the creation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to have taken much longer, due to interbreeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all types of shapes. It can be rolled into small forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can then be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed from them (since Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with wet and clean hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of drainage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, ancient Persia, and ancient China. In Roman civilisation, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women met together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the phone call and subsequently reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by means of a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
A giant rocket over 100 feet long is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle changed the world in unbelievable ways. The greatest thing the bicycle did for us is that it gave us easier and faster transport.
He brought with him the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that prey on much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special task that each cat has and that prevents it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social cats, and they live in large groups called "prides" in English.
The prides are made up of one to three related adult males, together with a maximum of thirty females and cubs.
The women are generally closely related to each other, as they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Hyena groups act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
A good all-round athlete, the tiger can climb (although not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull five times more than the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar loudly.
A tiger's growl is not like the lion's loud roar, but more like a clumsy utterance of mumbled words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by scent, by sniffing the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move stealthily, too. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they came from (such as if they move over a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily move back) they often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor instead of what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it will start to look increasingly less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
Plants create the oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans breathe out (i.e., exhale).
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants, and we make clothes from plants. A lot of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, and therefore feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Her long jaw was filled with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as another set of teeth on the roof of her mouth, meaning anyone who got in her way had no chance of escaping.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex would not have won against him.
While the majority of their food is familiar to us, the Romans actually had a number of festive items that were strange or unusual, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent like a mouse that hibernates a lot.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs, wealthy men preferred to have dinner together where they reclined on their sides while eating their food.
The meals of Ancient Rome could not include food that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have wheat, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard within the temple complex and, behind it, an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special towers in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The majority of Jewish family life took place outdoors.
The women used to do the cooking in the courtyard; the shops were simply open counters facing the street. Stone was used for building the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland had a small population. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But, regardless of the discovery he made, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although every country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think that there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its history, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, it is likely that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed had liberated northern France, but the South still remained unfree.
It was run by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the South of France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated the South of France and were turning towards Germany.
Civilization is a singular culture shared by a large and significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," which means civil, related to the Latin words "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and which in a way also defines the size of the society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilizational culture implies the transfer of knowledge from various generations, a persistent cultural imprint, and equitable dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—where Congress was its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it depended on state authorities to enforce all its acts, but, often, they did not cooperate.
He had no power to overcome the tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and they were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international matches and Olympic events.
The Japanese have almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands in Japan, Japan is often called, based on its geographical position, an "archipelago."
Taiwan's origins date back to the early 15th century when European sailors passing through the area recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the aboriginal corn production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
A large part of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a clearer idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the analog film era.
It is still produced today but, more importantly, its aspect ratio was inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are of this aspect ratio, or very similar to it.
The rule of thirds, often abused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
This states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states despite differences in language and customs.
His immense power affected everyone, from the sultan to the common villager.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The church's central authority had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many people to question whether this principle was being upheld.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, as it halted vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by various international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, thereby causing danger even to neutral ships.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the terrible things and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wished to avoid such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous employment manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different periods of time; each stage of China and each family that held power were distinctive dynasties.
Also, between each dynasty there was a period of instability with the provinces divided. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these periods of time there was a fierce war between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China, where thousands of people died fighting to take the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all male applicants and this allowed the most ambitious and capable to succeed.
The same applies to the military because instead of being based on class, army ranks were now based on calibre.
The French Revolution also inspired many other working-class people repressed in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived throughout time, clearly demonstrates Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
At the summit of one of the mountains in the North of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if someone knows it exists. Once you enter the cave, there is total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except for a clear and beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures that were built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small crypts, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, crypts, and temples were built to honor the women and family members of Khufu.
The "up-stroke" mark looks like a V, and the "down-stroke" mark looks like a staple or a square shape without the bottom.
Upbow means that you should start at the tip and push the bow, and downbow means that you should start at the frog (the place where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
Playing an instrument with strings upwards generates a softer sound, while playing downwards is louder and more assertive.
You can make any markings you want with the pencil, but remember that the bowing markings are there for a musical reason and therefore, normally, they should be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, terrified, on 6 October 1789 were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a violent mob of market women.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point a member of the crowd waved the head of the royal guard who had been killed in Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The costs of the US imperialist war in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the United States colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Naturally, the super-profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the basic achievements of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that led to the order's creation.
The time in which the events took place was commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
Before the High Middle Ages there was the Early Middle Ages which was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is agreed to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas in practice, from technological push or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a course largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, and therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher occurrence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, habits and a culture related to that geography resulted, and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
His status worsened during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned carrying gifts such as silk and spices that were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
During this period, the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and the 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, because communication channels are slow, Western styles may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of that time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out to produce enough food to only satisfy the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses saved seeds native to the ecoregion along with crop rotation or other techniques that are relatively simple in order to maximize yield.
Historically, many farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still applicable in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes modes, manners, and language.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to use a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Such children are called "feral" or savage. Some feral children have been locked away by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of children was due to the parents' rejection of a serious intellectual or physical impairment of the children.
Feral children may have experienced child abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are alleged to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviour (within physical limits) almost entirely like that of the particular animals that cared for it, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the learning method called scaffolding is more effective.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method but, rather, an aid that provides support to individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold but even the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office is a scaffold.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software and aims to question, prompt, and explain procedures that might have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but this still happens.
We consider the Foster Care System as a zone of safety for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that were lacking in the home that they were taken from previously.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last only milliseconds.
Particularly, it is said that one can tell if a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
In his essay “The President’s Speech”, Oliver Sacks pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are, nevertheless, able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such skills in interpreting human behavior also exist in animals like domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variation back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from the plant resources available.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: reduced growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins accessible in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast to this, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a high quantity of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in almost the same way as chimpanzees living in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process where you intentionally wake yourself up during your normal sleep period and go back to sleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm that brings you to your senses without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock while you're asleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives based on biorhythms involve drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a popular diuretic) before bed, thus forcing the person to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in that person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can become enlightened. The only obstacle to this is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they were expanded with the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
As a principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the idea that love accepts everything.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Deities. Through the visualization of various deities, one cleanses the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates a consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, disagreements in system, process, and culture led the countries to fight.
Only two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was going to last for the next 40 years and was going to be fought for real, by alternative armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for freight transport is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, mainly using U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to defeat Great Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It turns out that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to have an easy way of acquiring milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, and they were often attended by goat herders who were often children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known shepherds. These herd guarding methods are still in use today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagonways consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and pull larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Crossties were introduced quite early on to hold the rails in place. However, gradually, the realization grew that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron strip at the top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron lines were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking, with humans starting to walk upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (which means upright man) emerged.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists in order to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. Nevertheless, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we must find the source of the problems, and we must deactivate it.
It is obvious enough that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and the problems have become greater due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's print shop.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "the Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who ordered it to be read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today. We call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still make them seem like dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and sharp claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, that is 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not appear immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis may not be possible.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects very well adapted as human parasites.
Both Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in a nest or the place of their host.
Across the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides much of scientific research.
However, she is not alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
When knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external cues, have been documented for most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a free-running cycle period even without external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments by labeling either the bacteriophage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visits to parks and the study of ecosystem information.
An example of this is visiting, taking photos, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns of the country by car to go to work and pass by other people whose workplace is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle for everyone, everyone is, in some way, tied to, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems create such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow studies are difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a reasonably consistent manner; therefore, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to start flying. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back into place along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems sensible, because we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, reaching a width of six miles in some places.
In total, 20 percent of all the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's mainstream is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids remained the largest in size and the best in the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which, at the time, were already more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
The Italian language is also an everyday language used by many of those who work in the government, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as they can all be found in nature in native form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, came up with the theory that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have an alloy that includes small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of very small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as newer methods of writing emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and less use.
People now type messages on computer screens, and never have to go near a typewriter.
Who knows what will happen to the keyboard when something newer is invented.
The fission bomb works on the principle of taking energy to bind a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similarly to pushing a heavy cart uphill. The re-splitting of the nucleus then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to split with little to no effort.
The face of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km wide on the near side and 100 km wide on the far side.
It is thinner under the "maria" and thicker under the "highlands".
There might be more lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on finding what makes people happy or motivates them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories analyze what makes certain people want the things they want and which things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of attitudes can result when managers start managing those who were previously their colleagues. One end of the spectrum is that they try to continue to feel like one of them.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary action, perform evaluations, assign responsibilities, and ensure people are held accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything about the team and mark it as their own.
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often creates divisions between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet according to varying time zones, and this may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, page 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals for practically implementing the concepts of a learning organization is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, an organization's collaborative process to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that satisfies the client's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared awareness and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the Continuous Sequence approach as a method being used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, this makes the field of research less vast and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
For a long time, it has been known that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our brains.
Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, and deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research into AI involves creating machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Things like these have become separate disciplines, focusing on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and it has been built into various computer software applications in homes and video games.
Field trips are a big part of every class. Often, teachers like to take their students to places that are not possible to go to by bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual on-site trips. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a virtual field trip with others is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, every year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the fact that they have an audience generally leads to this situation changing.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts working to improve their writing so as not to be criticized.
Also, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to satisfy the audience's interest inspires students to be more engaging and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by responding actively to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of other people's writings and explain their perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital city of Canada and contains a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as the perfect example of what foreigners consider to be Canadian.
Large areas further north have a rather sparse population, and some are almost uninhabited natural areas.
For a population comparison that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent unto itself when we talk about wildlife.
Many of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury resorts on beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the North, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the South and West by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman traveling say she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's useful to wear a ring as well (but not one that looks like it's worth a lot of money).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they may consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Stand firm when refusing men, and don't be afraid to insist on your preference (whether there are cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean you have to accept everything as good!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but then abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and it was given the name "Casablanca" by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of knick-knacks, but they are all touristy.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's roads, particularly the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any excursions outside of Goma should be researched to be aware of the state of the fighting that still persists in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use a bodaboda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Together with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic and remote lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during the Henry Louis Gates' PBS special series "Wonders of the African World".
The city contrasts sharply with the other cities of the country, because it has more Arab than African elements.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the Northeast of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique in the East, Zimbabwe in the North, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each containing different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, daily conservation and park entry fees apply.
It can also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to either selected parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The arrangement of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a bar chart with a sparkling light due to its appearance with the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
The majority of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the North shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers took as their own, and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest littoral mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangroves in wetlands—they include some of the last remaining stands of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about a third is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (along the river) throughout the day, although many of them, especially those heading East and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is recommended to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Several districts have Coaster bus services consisting of small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and reliable.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control points are expected to be ready.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region contained other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquerors with native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches may also appear here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere in the islands and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and US currency may be accepted; speak to the owners in advance to see what method of payment is acceptable.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located in the Southern Hemisphere, it will be summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There aren't particular "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wild animals still remain wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
Regardless of how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
However, you should be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong odors and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of slightly less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the mid-19th century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous naval conflict in 1889 where seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the killing of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many sandy beaches, because Auckland is situated between two harbours. The most well-known are located in three zones.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and the majority have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located within the Waitemata Harbour, in the prestigious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sandy beaches suitable for families, which can sometimes be crowded and have a good selection of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines you can find, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia probably travel better.
The local tap water is fine to drink, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the idea of coffee called "flat white" is unfamiliar. "Short black" is "espresso," cappuccino comes filled with a lot of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juice costs a lot of money but is excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Still, you should seek advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay very close attention to safety messages.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of the 1770 latitude. They can sometimes also be seen outside of these times.
Although sharks exist, they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away from them.
Saltwater Crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their primary habitat is in river estuaries North from Rockhampton.
If they book in advance, the traveler will have peace of mind knowing that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport, and even packages that combine the flight and the hotel.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need more time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any amendment or request must first go through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of those attending music festivals decide to camp on-site, and many of them consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close, you need to arrive early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may be over, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are going to cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, choose your cabin carefully, because when you pass through the ice, it makes a horrible noise for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize the time and money that guests spend there. There are generally no windows or clocks, and it can be difficult to find the exits.
They generally have special food, drink, and entertainment offers to keep guests in a good mood and keep them on site.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, there isn't much friction and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During heavy snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a short time to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic mostly continues without interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the main draw for many visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to a land journey to observe African wild and wonderful animals, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars and close to standard equipment that allows for good views.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "going footing") consists of a hike, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be organized in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it already hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, many coronavirus-based cancellation policies did not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that the majority of event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for use, even if you don't have one in your room.
If an iron is not available, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which could cause it to shrink, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, in others, several minutes are needed.
The filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter shy animals that they are not familiar with in the regions where they live.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, generally do not qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers going to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, because it frequently passes through isolated stretches of backwoods.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: there is a prevalence of steep hills, narrow lanes and sharp turns.
The maximum speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and subsequent sections – commonly 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
However, curiously, the cell phone service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are common, with cooked apples being used in pies year-round, and cherries and plums coming into season in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Well-known cakes often go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try those which, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "saucy" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Because there are 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is a general term that covers the vast variety of regional cooking found across the country.
However, if used without further qualifiers, the term tends to refer to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now widely available throughout the archipelago, includes a range of simply seasoned dishes, and the predominant flavorings favored by the Javanese are peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can have safety issues due to the potential for the rider's feet to get caught in them.
If a rider falls from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse bolts. To reduce this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, many riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Subsequently, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with various large granite and rock walls.
The highlights include spectacular views from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes among its endless potential of walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding downhill on snow-covered ground on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings showing skiers go back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking with skis: This activity is also called "backcountry ski", "ski touring" or "ski hiking".
It is related to, but generally does not involve, ski touring or alpinism, where the latter takes place on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you'll be able to cover slightly longer distances than if you were walking – but it's only very rarely that you'll have the speeds of "cross country" skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it contains many independent countries. Normally, to travel through many countries, you would have to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a single country in this respect.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured goods are antiques. Some tax agencies define items more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, although they are more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many people who have other professions.
Even traditionally, despite this, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like, and kept reindeer mostly as animals to pull heavy loads.
Today, many Sámi work in modern crafts. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although used extensively, especially among non-Roma people, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions about the Roma people.
If the country you are going to visit becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You might also consider consulting the advice of other governments and not just your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
An advisory report is a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
The views presented are often cursory, general, and oversimplified when compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of weather, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rain, and fires in uncultivated areas are types and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include severe hailstorms, blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather that may affect their area as it may affect their travel plans.
Anyone organizing a visit to a country that can be considered a war zone must undertake professional training.
An internet search for "Hostile Environment Course" will likely bring up the address of a local company.
The course normally covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course usually lasts from 2-5 days and involves role-playing, a lot of first aid training, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but there aren't many publications about war zones.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or updated documents to match a preferred name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies just as widely.
Security screenings at checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the return flow from waves breaking off the beach, often in a channel or similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and can form a rapid current to the deep water there.
Many deaths occur due to exhaustion after one tries to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, it won't be any more difficult than usual to swim back.
Try to aim somewhere you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you might prefer to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock comes before culture shock (there's a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more intense.
Travelers who found it easy to adjust to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return to your country after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your country's culture.
When you travelled, at first people probably were patient and understood you, because they know that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also required for travellers returning home.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the children's area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Generally, you always hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The sound and light show is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids and different pyramids are lit up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest one is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception Island where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the Peninsula merge into the plain, then rise again to form the 360 km Ellsworth Mountains range, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a peak reaching 4892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally doesn't replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outside with a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that need to communicate remotely by voice and data.
Your local phone service provider should be able to give you more information about how to connect to this service.
A choice that is becoming more popular among those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular with school leavers, allowing them to take a year off before entering university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course during a gap year abroad can actually improve your chances of progressing to higher education back in your home country.
Typically, there will be a fee for tuition to register in these educational programs.
Finland is a very good destination for sailing. The "Land of a thousand lakes" has thousands of islands as well, in the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lagoons are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, where there is a boat for every seven or eight people.
This also applies to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Many of the distinguished cruises in the Baltic include an extended visit to St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a full two days while returning to sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore using ship-organized excursions, you won't need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises advertise Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from the fears and personal aversions that many people have towards other things.
For some, understanding a little about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help them overcome a fear that is based on what they don't know or on things they have no control over.
Courier companies are paid well for delivering things quickly. Often, time is of the essence when it comes to commercial documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
If the goods were sent by air freight, on some routes it may have taken days to clear unloading and customs.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a thick wad of cash for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, this doesn't come cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally, it doesn't make sense to look for discounts on business class and first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain important group of air travelers who are willing to pay top prices for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and in comfort, and they charge for these things.
The capital city of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christian.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
What once was the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling business center, built around an enormous bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are punctuated by traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, one finds interesting marble sculptures of doves on certain graves.
You won't regret spending half an hour strolling around the intriguing village.
To the North and easily reached is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron's laudatory description of its great beauty.
Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Furthermore, in the North, visit the grand Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Chapel), a place of Marian apparitions known worldwide.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site, as well as a site of almost immeasurable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive today who managed to survive their time there, and many more who had their loved ones killed or worked to death there, Jews as well as non-Jews.
Please treat the site with the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half the people prefer to speak Catalan, the majority of people understand it, and practically everyone knows how to speak Spanish.
However, most signs are marked only in Catalan because it is established by law as the primary official language.
However, Spanish is also used extensively in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, cold, and arrogant.
While often this is just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to cope in Paris is still to behave well, and act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). This helps considerably to cope more easily.
The unfriendly attitudes of Parisians quickly fade away when you show them basic courtesies.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered with many trees, mainly beech, spruce and fir, and contains a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitudes.
The area also hosts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat and the capercaillie can be found there, along with many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Many of the monasteries provide shawls for women who are not prepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colours, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the stock available at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each person wears them, so you might not feel comfortable wearing those skirts. For men, there is a one-size-fits-all!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in every dish.
A popular and simple dish, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and available condiments such as cheese, tuna in oil, etc.
All nouns, next to the word "Sie" for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of the sentence.
This is an important method to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
Certainly, this facilitates reading, although the writing is a little complicated due to the need to know whether a verb or adjective is being used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy because many words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters you need to watch out for are "c" and "g", because their pronunciation varies depending on which vowel follows them.
Apart from that, make sure you pronounce r and rr differently: caro means expensive, while carro means cart.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and, for the most part, regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar book can help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
Obviously, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that there's no need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete nowadays, and remain as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution at its peak wasn't the type of problem we have now, these were generally located in cities or campuses, and it is easier to reach them than those built in modern times.
Many modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as "hanami", has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were hosted by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy only around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural environment, therefore, resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally organized garden, collecting "samples" will also get you kicked out, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to be and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But when placed in the "high tropics," just a few degrees north of the equator, you will need to face both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is less frequent).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you are planning to catch goes to Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement near Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme to base a vacation around.
For example, visits to castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or cruises to interesting cities on the Danube or boat trips along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes of popular trails for long walks and cycling.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christianity, and it is celebrated as Jesus's birthday.
Many of the traditions associated with the feast have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There's a tradition of spending Easter Eve awake in an exposed location to watch the sunrise.
Obviously there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often organize an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, and congregations often begin the celebrations at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, and therefore the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you go to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, as the sky will be more or less dark all the time.
Since the areas have a low population, and light pollution therefore often doesn't cause problems, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard work attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with emphasis placed on teamwork rather than encouraging individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain the approval of their superiors for any decision they make, and they are expected to obey the instructions of their superiors without reservation.
