USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter and acknowledges the Olympic family's absolute need to foster a safe environment for all athletes.
We agree with the USOC's report that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, may be better served by moving forward with meaningful change within our organization rather than dictating determinations.

This further confirms the widely discussed theory that only some dinosaurs had feathers, and it also provides details about color and three-dimensional structure, which are generally not available from fragmentary fossils.
Scientists say that the surface of this animal's plumage was chestnut-brown in color and the underside was light or carotenoid in color.
The discovery provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers wouldn't have had a fully developed rachis, it's called a "rachis" (hypothetically), but they do possess other feather features – barbs and barbules – researchers inferred the rachis, suggesting these other features might have been a later evolutionary development.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for thermoregulation or display. Although it is a juvenile dinosaur's tail, researchers suggest the specimen shows developed feathers, not downy ones.
Although this is a small dinosaur tail, researchers suggest that the specimen's findings indicate it has adult scars and is not the backside of a chick.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb explosion at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than twenty people.

Luminosity and rotation are simultaneously used to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
A star with a low Rossby number is likely to be very active with magnetospheric interactions.

Only theory-based works have often been completed. But this project was written ad hoc to monitor the Sagittarius constellation.
The impact faced by the cluster is caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the star and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on Earth and causes tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that one dark matter affects another dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter affects ordinary matter.
The very dark matter surrounding the galaxy is arranged in a halo shape around the galaxy, and it is largely made up of small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech affair: voters isolate themselves in a booth, mark their preferred candidate's name on a pre-printed slip of paper, and place it in an envelope.
After verifying the voter's identity, the officer will have the voter deposit the envelope in the ballot box and sign the voter register.
The French electoral law rigorously enforces the rules.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes other than the properly counted and validated ballots have been added.
Candidates may send their representatives to observe this process. In the evening, the votes will be counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following a specific procedure.

In the current women's group, four skiers failed to finish their run, and in the Giant Slalom, a total of 45 out of 117 skiers failed to place in the race.
Police in Madhya Pradesh recovered a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
"Police Sub-Inspector D.K. Arya said, "We have arrested five individuals who sexually assaulted a Swiss woman and have seized a laptop and mobile phone from them.""
The names of the accused are, respectively, Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Khasa Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
Nevertheless, the driver survived with severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed. Meanwhile, emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adikoya has been in the custody of the Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then for the crime of killing her son.
He faces pending charges and an investigation, but any eyewitness accounts could be tainted as his photograph has been widely publicized.
This is common practice in England, but Scottish law operates differently, with courts considering the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University stated that "journalists are treading a dangerous path by publishing photographs of suspects."
The high office managing the overall responsibility of the cases pointed out to journalists that no further comments would be made until at least the charges are filed.
According to the released confidential information, the document concerns the border dispute regarding Palestine claiming the border that existed during the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics mentioned concern the future province of holy Jerusalem for both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a ten-year military presence in the valley once the agreement is signed, but the PA only agrees to concede to a five-year military presence.
Since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated, the guards must closely monitor the shooters in the auxiliary pest control experiment.
Qualified volunteers were employed under the Sporting Shooters Association's Hunting Program, in collaboration with NSW and Sporting Shooters Association Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, alternate director of NPWS’s Park Conservation and Heritage, comprehensive safety and training details have been provided to the four selected shooters.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Committee recommended that the previous CEO's resignation be part of the effort to move the country towards new elections.
This commission is Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Sporadic violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections since 2011.
There have been 60 complaints of iPads overheating and malfunctioning, which have caused a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that it is aware of 27 accidents related to equipment.
Last week, METI stated that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents to them, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry, responding to this, stated that Apple delaying the report is "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office has stated that no damage occurred in the country.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former police officer from the Philippines hijacked a bus with Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held them hostage.
Rolando Mendoza used his M16 rifle to shoot tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, and it has been confirmed that at least 6 people have died so far.
Similar to the Philippine photographers, six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released first.
Photographers took the place of the elderly woman who needed the restroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical field.
Having trained as an obstetrician, she began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Likins began to investigate premature birth in his spare time.
His research suggests that if a person's hormones are managed, it can accelerate the maturation of the baby's fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government officials recovered two 'black boxes' from the plane.
Luna's fellow wrestlers also paid tribute.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first of the extremists. Luna Vachon died two moons ago at night. As different as she was. A tough broad."
"Luna is as mischievous as me... maybe even more so," Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "I love her, and I grieve her loss... I believe she's in a better place now."
The number of people who voted before the 2010 federal election and opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008, among 1,400 people.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent voted that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
At the height of the opinion poll, 29 percent of people believe that Australia should soon become a republic, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic swimming gold medalist was scheduled to participate in the Commonwealth Games in the 100m, 200m, and three relays, but his participation is now questionable due to his fitness.
He couldn't take the necessary medications to relieve his pain because they are banned in sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of mathematical sciences at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Using various hardware and software at the beginning of February, many verified the discovery, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the Earth, as well as creating proteins with organic matter to support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, through information from comets colliding with Earth long ago.
53-year-old Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year and signed the same-sex marriage bill into law last month.
He dismissed these rumors as "meaningless political talk and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
The FAA says that NextGen will allow planes to fly on shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-radar based technology, allowing air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation has been arranged, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available at the stadium.
Concerns about inadequate transportation facilities may potentially lead to the necessity of playing behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported on the emergence of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that new species have formed in just two generations, although it was believed this process would take much longer, with intermittent breeding being the cause of the Daphne Major finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris, evolving.
Gold is malleable into any shape. It can even be made into small spheres.
It can be drawn into a fine wire, twisted, and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made extremely thin and layered onto another metal. Sometimes it can be made so thin that it's used in books with hand-painted images, which are called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called chemical pH. You can create an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage changes the color of its juice depending on how acidic or alkaline it is.
pH level is indicated by the measure of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then knead them with clean, damp hands and form into balls.
The moisture in your hands interacts with the outer layers of skin, which gives a funny feeling and creates a kind of superficial shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been discovered in homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths used together by men and women.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call from Earth and immediately reflects it back down as requested.
The satellite was sent to space via a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and visibility.
Placing a satellite or telescope in space requires a massive rocket, about 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has given us is easier and faster transportation.
This has brought us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Under them are medium-sized felines that prey on medium-sized food, ranging from rabbits to gazelles and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including domestic cats) eat various types of small insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is the concept of "to each their own," where each cat has a specific job unique to them, preventing competition with the others.
Lions are social cats that live in large groups called prides.
A lion pride consists of one to three large adult males, up to thirty females, and cubs.
Within a large family, sisters and daughters are generally closely related to each other as women.
Like lions, wolves or dogs behave remarkably (but not other feline species), and their actions are similar and also very dangerous.
A skilled athlete can jump, swim, and cross greater distances to a certain extent like a tiger, and can pull an object with 5 times more vigor than a human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four cats that can roar.
A tiger's growl is not like a lion's grand roar, but more like a growling phrase with sharp, spoken words.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals. They will try to catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and eat animals that are in the ground by smelling and sniffing them out.
Ocelots have good night vision and are adept at moving stealthily. Ocelots blend in with their surroundings and leap to hunt their prey.
When a small population (a small populace) separates from a larger population (if they pass through a mountain or a river, or if they migrate to a new island in such a way that they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so different aspects or modifications are needed to be stronger competitors than what was required before in front of the new population.
The true population will never change; like in the past, they need adaptations today.
Over time, the new population adapts to the different new environment, and therefore, they appear different from the rest of the people.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, that is, the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans breathe out (i.e., release).
Plants create their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, and thus feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
With over 70 knife-like sharp teeth in its long jaws and an additional set of teeth on the roof of its mouth, it means that anyone who gets in its way cannot escape.
We are not entirely sure, but its teeth were probably very sharp. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and mosasaurs. It might have even been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that entered the water; even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex couldn't match its size.
Most of the Romans' food is familiar to us, but the Romans also had a share of strange or unusual feast items. They served wild boar, peacock, snails, and rodents called dormice as feasts.
Another major difference is that poor people would sit on chairs with their women and eat, while the rich would prefer to lounge on their sides and eat the feast together.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included foods that arrived in Europe from Asia or the Americas centuries later.
For example, they did not eat corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa. And no ancient Roman could ever have tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for all their gods, considering it their home.
People bring offerings for God. Priests try to fulfill God's needs through festivals and celebrations.
Every temple has an outer open-air pavilion and an inner sanctum sanctorum where only priests are allowed.
Sometimes, they built towers, often referred to as special pyramid-shaped ziggurats, as part of the temples.
At the top of the tower, there was a special shrine for the deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a home is not as important.
A large part of Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops faced the street and appeared as open spaces. Stone was used to build the house.
Since the land of Canaan had no large forests, wood was very expensive.
Greenland saw very little settlement. Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder. As he sailed further west, they say he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Even without his discovery, the Eskimo people were already living there.
Even if all countries were 'Scandinavian', there were many differences in people, rulers, customs, and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Even though something was written on the back of that document, it is not a treasure map.
What is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence assurance speech is, "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
In a state where nobody knew who had written it (1), in the early part of its life, that large leather document (its dimensions 29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
Therefore, this annotation might have simply been added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated the northern part of France, but the east was still not liberated.
"It was governed by the "Vichy" French, who were the same French people that made a peace treaty with the Germans in the 1940s and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them."
On August 15th, 1940, following the Allied invasion of southern France, that invasion was called 'Operation Dragoon'.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture where a significant large group of people as a society work together in unity and live together.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," meaning civil, "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning state or province of a state, and it somehow defines the scope of society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilised culture signifies the sharing of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and equitable distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and are missed, not being recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states – comprised only of a Congress – formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress party did not have the power to levy taxes. Lacking a national executive or judiciary, it was largely dependent on often uncooperative government officials to enforce its laws.
It did not even have the power to regulate interstate tax and customs duties.
These rules required unanimous consent from all states before being amended, and the state government often took the central government very casually, largely because their representatives were not present there.
The German national football team, along with the Italian national football team, is the joint second most successful team in the world, and they were also the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and the Olympics along with them.
The 7,000 islands in Japan (the largest of which is Honshu) make Japan the 7th largest island country in the world.
Due to Japan's cluster/group of islands, from a geographical perspective, Japan is called an archipelago.
Taiwan's history began in the 15th century when European sailors, passing by, recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a shift in indigenous grain production methods and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces seized control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding all rights to Taiwan to Japan, which ruled it until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings have been restored around the edges of the complex to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration efforts continue to this day.
For example, the most common standard format for still photography in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film format during the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio was adopted by digital camera image sensor formats.
Actually, the 35 mm format is a bit confusing, as it's 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this design (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common systems (for example, ABS type systems) are equal to or nearly close to this natural ratio.
The rule of thirds, a frequently mocked guideline, is a simple way to create dynamism in a photograph by imposing a degree of order.
The key lesson states that the powerful spot is located at the intersection of lines that divide a form into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was subjected to scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity preserved European countries, transcending their differences in language and customs.
The power that pervaded everything affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the tenets of Christian doctrine is that wealth should be used to eliminate suffering and poverty (1), and that the financial wealth of churches exists primarily for this reason.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the Church has been based in Rome, and this concentration of authority and wealth in one place leads many to question whether fundamental principles are being upheld.
As soon as these protests erupted, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
Despite this siege violating generally accepted international law, codified in numerous international agreements over the past two centuries, the strategy proved effective in cutting off key military and civilian supplies.
Britain laid mines in international waters, including in areas of the sea to prevent any ships from entering, posing a danger to neutral ships as well.
Having seen limited results from this tactic, Germany expected a similar outcome from unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the widespread attitude of most citizens and nations was one of reliance on peace and isolation.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla traveled to America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to America with 4 cents in his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his previous job) to give to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China adhered to a distinct system in different periods; each stage in China, or each family in power, constituted a unique dynasty.
Provinces were divided between each dynasty, and instability prevailed. The Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties, is particularly well-known for this era.
During this period, there was a fierce war among many nobles to seize the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was a bloody period in ancient Chinese history, with thousands fighting and dying for the high seat of the great palace in Xi'an.
The adoption of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to republic, and nationalism, along with the belief that the nation belongs to the people and not just one individual, are some of the many social and political consequences.
After the revolution, all jobs were open to all male applicants, allowing those who were most enthusiastic and successful to advance.
These also apply to the military because they are based on ability rather than the hierarchy of the military.
The French Revolution inspired revolutions among oppressed working-class people in other countries as well.
Muhammad was deeply involved in matters beyond worldly life. He often went to a cave later called "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (Light) to meditate.
He established a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations in his timeless cave.
The cave, situated atop a mountain north of Mecca, was completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, even if one knows it exists, finding it is not easy. Once inside the cave, it's total isolation.
From inside the cave, one can barely see or hear the outside world; all that can be seen is the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous mountains surrounding it.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian valley contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest among them), numerous smaller tombs, multiple temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The " மேல் வில்" mark looked like a V, and the "கீழ் விற் குறி" looked like a staple pin or a square missing its bottom part.
மேல் என்றால் நீங்கள் நுனியிலிருந்து தொடங்கி அந்த வில்லை அழுத்த வேண்டும், மற்றும் கீழ் என்றால் நீங்கள் தவளையில் (எங்கே உங்கள் கை அந்த வில்லைப் பிடித்திருக்கிறதோ) தொடங்கி வில்லை இழுக்க வேண்டும். For "up," it means you start from the tip and push the bow; and for "down," it means you start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
When the lower bow is strong and emphatic, the upper bow usually produces a softer sound.
Feel free to write your own scores, but remember that musical conventions exist for a reason and should generally be respected.
A frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two younger children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse, four-year-old Louis Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were driven from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
As they rode in the carriage back to Paris, a mob surrounded them, shouting, threatening the King and Queen with curses.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point in Versailles, a member of the mob showed the head of a royal guard, who had been killed, to the queen, who was staring in bewilderment.
The Filipino people paid for the war expenses of American imperialism that occupied the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government, largely to provide for expenses and the interest on bonds held in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking.
Certainly, the fundamental gains of U.S. imperialism may be the massive profits from exploitation derived in many ways from the Filipino people.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the environment that prompted the organization's creation.
The period when these events occurred is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history (AD 1000-1300) encompassing the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries.
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages, and the Late Middle Ages followed, all of which traditionally came to an end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term with a variety of ideas in practice, ranging from technological impetus or technological necessity to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
The explanations about the imperatives of technology reveal two (2) ideas: that technological development follows a path transcending cultural or political influence, and that the "effects" of technology on society are more inherent than caused by social impact.
For example, one might say that the motor car essentially leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for some cars alone, so new manufacturing methods are being developed in an effort to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The public owning cars leads to many accidents on the road, which in turn drives the health sector to discover new technologies to repair injured bodies.
The biggest aspect of cultural certainty came in Romanticism, drawing from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Regarding Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, geography-related customs and culture arose. Furthermore, being in harmony with society was considered superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
While Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It flourished as a hub of luxury from around 400 A.D. to 1100 A.D.
Its status began to decline in the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with more valuable silks and spices than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at that time that the title of capital of civilization was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most prevalent between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles may have lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
It was only towards the end of the Middle Ages that Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of that era was that people began using buttons to fasten clothing as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is when a farmer produces only enough food in agriculture for themselves and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses saved seeds, is native to the environment, and maximizes yield by integrating their crop rotation or other simple methods.
Historically, most farmers relied on agriculture for their livelihoods, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by societal norms, helping them cultivate an identity for themselves.
Subcultures may be distinctive due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
Subcultures are defined by characteristics distinguished by language, appearance, religion, politics, gender, geography, or a combination of several of these.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic styles of dress, behavior, and language.
The best way to proclaim the importance of socialization is to rehabilitate children or adults who have been unfortunate, disgraced, or abused by children, and to bring children unfamiliar with the public sphere back into it.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, abandonment occurs due to parents rejecting the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
It is said that others were raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the forest on their own.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, the feral child completely (to the extent that their physical condition allows) exhibits the behavior of the animal that raised them, such as fearing or ignoring humans.
Experiential learning makes learning easier and more interesting. Scaffolding takes it one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a way to provide support to individuals who are using a new system to gain a new learning experience or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be real or virtual, that is, like a teacher being a scaffold, or like the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are built into the software and should be designed to question, prompt, and explain procedures that students may find challenging to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, including neglect, hurtful speech, and extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an uncaring, unloving, and uneducated environment, but they do.
We believe that foster care will be a safe place for these children.
Our foster care organization is committed to providing a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The expectation is that foster care will provide all the needs that were lacking in the previous home.
The internet integrates elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
Some of the notable characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions of benefits and a satisfaction-oriented approach.
For example, learning and socialization are key motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
When Imai and Mikkor analyzed visitor responses to websites, they identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as two new motivating factors.
The use of video recordings led to important discoveries such as subtle emotional expressions and facial movements that may only last for a split second.
It is said that one can detect if a person is lying by accurately interpreting the nuances of their micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his analysis of "The President's Speech," pointed out that it is possible to accurately gauge the sincerity of people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage.
He even suggests that such abilities, which reflect human behavior, may be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research indicates that there are two types of genetic variations: recessive and expressed.
Mutation introduces new genetic variations, and selection removes it from the stated variation type.
The intergenerational gap oscillates back and forth, varying through separation and reconciliation.
Outside of the savanna grasslands, it would be difficult for an animal with a digestive system like humans to meet its amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure leads to severe consequences such as developmental regression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The easiest to obtain plant-based protein sources are the proteins found in leaves and legumes. However, they are difficult for mammals like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easily digestible, but they are high-quality protein sources that contain all the necessary amino acids.
Having considered all aspects, it is no surprise to learn that our ancestors would have solved the protein problem, much like chimpanzees do today in the savanna.
Sleep disturbance is waking up from your normal sleep time for some reason, and going back to sleep after a while (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings back memory without fully waking you up.
If you're the type to turn off your alarm clock while you're still asleep, place it on the other side of the room and force yourself to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based practices include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water, tea, a well-known diuretic) before sleeping, which prompts us to wake up from sleep to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is related to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
Low stress and the ability to find complete peace and satisfaction in every person leads to a more positive life.
We can all attain the light of wisdom. Our anxiety and negative thoughts are the obstacles to this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been extended through the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and all-embracing love.
Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is activated through Kundalini Yoga by means of yogic postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. By visualizing various deities, energy blockages are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened awareness is cultivated.
Cooperation existed between the USA and the USSR because Germany was a common enemy in World War II. After the war ended, differences in systems, processes, and cultures drove the two countries apart.
Two years after the war ended, former allies had now become enemies, and the Cold War began.
Using fake armies in reality, it continued for the next 40 years in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, with the Polish defense already broken, the hope was to reorganize on the Romanian bridgehead.
However, the plans became obsolete overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered. This created Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after violating the Treaty of Riga and occupying eastern parts of Poland, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the sea.
The navy's traditional job is to ensure your nation maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time, hindering your adversary's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII, in which Americans tried to transport people and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, mainly using U-boat types, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allied forces had lost, Germany could have conquered Britain just as it conquered other parts of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran approximately 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and indigenous peoples knew how to easily access milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats are often herded in flocks and roam the mountains or graze in meadows, frequently guided by children or young people, especially someone called a shepherd, widely referred to as a goatherd. This type of herding is still in practice today.
The Vegan Vase was built in England in the early 16th century.
Even though the cart tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to pull at excessive speeds and pull more weight than on slightly rough roads.
Early on, crossbars were introduced to secure the tracks. However, it was realized that the tracks would be even more robust if they had an iron strip gradually placed on top.
Even though it became a regular practice, it caused significant wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the iron carts.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first all-iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The earliest known form of transportation is walking, with humans starting to walk around two million years ago when Homo erectus (upright man) appeared.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, were not habitually upright walkers.
While Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago, bipedalism as a special trait is seen in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago.
We can start living in greater harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can act as activists to reduce future impacts to some extent.
This is often like treating the symptoms. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and neutralize them.
It is evident that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological advancements of humankind, and problems have increased due to the larger population and the more luxurious lifestyles of humans.
After being accepted by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, located a few buildings away, after being signed by both the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson.
Throughout the night, 150 to 200 copies were created, and they are now called "Dunlop broadsides."
The first public reading of this document was on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall, read by John Nixon.
A man was dispatched to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to the troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The existing 25 vellum folios are the oldest surviving copies of that document. The original manuscript has not survived.
Many paleontologists still believe that a group of dinosaurs escaped extinction and live on to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of themselves as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are still many things in birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have scales and clawed feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like T-Rex.
All computers in use today are based on the principle of handling information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary digit can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits or, in computer parlance, bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms like vomiting are often too general to allow for immediate diagnosis.
A key sign of internal poisoning could be an open container of medication or household chemical toxins.
Refer to its specific label in the first aid recommendation for that particular issue.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in the formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is associated with ancient words referring to bedbugs, which are parasites adapted to live on humans.
Both venomous insects and bedbugs are nest dwellers, living in nests or adapted to the housing of their host.
With approximately 400,000 known cases throughout the United States, multiple sclerosis (MS) is a leading neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that multiple sclerosis is twice as common in women as in men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of the child.
These couples are choosing plans to adopt a child for themselves.
In adoption, the birth parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to become the child's parents.
The primary goal of science is to scientifically discover how this world works. This methodology effectively guides various scientific researches.
It's not just about testing; testing is an examination that can be used to reject one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, generate notes, and guide further scientific experiments.
Nature enthusiasts and philosophers also focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in scientific matters, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language dwindles, the West feels disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on biological clocks, primarily on the existence and production of endogenous cycles.
Rhythmic patterns that are not just ordinary responses to external time cues have been documented for a variety of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain easily-entrained rhythms even in the absence of external cues.
One of the key recommendations for DNA being a genetic material is the Hershey and Chase experiment.
Hershey and Chase used phages (or viruses) to inject their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two (2) experiments, labeling the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or labeling the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Sudden changes can cause various kinds of impacts, which will depend on the sudden change itself, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the changes have affected the gene sequence of cells.
Only changes in germline cells can be passed on to children, whereas changes elsewhere may lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism, which involves visiting natural sites to enjoy sights of plants and wildlife, greatly attracts people.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and reading information about the environment.
For example, regarding the orangutans in Borneo, activities like taking photos, learning, and sightseeing.
Every day in the morning, people travel in cars from small towns to their workplaces, passing others who work in the area they are leaving from, on their way to their jobs.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and served by a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this vast carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states, which had supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
You will occasionally hear similar complaints in developed countries, such as about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why are transport systems subject to such complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic congestion is the study of the movement and interaction of vehicles and individual drivers between two points.
Unfortunately, analyzing traffic flow is a bit difficult because it's impossible to predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers are proactive in operating vehicles within a reasonably consistent range; as a result, traffic has a fair degree of stability and can be mathematically described.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate the planning, design, and operations of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helps them to easily escape from predators and efficiently find food and mates.
Most insect species have the ability to fold their wings back against their body.
This provides them with a wide array of small hiding places to escape from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
A thousand years ago, Aristarchus stated that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people considered his statement to be correct, while many others considered it to be wrong; that statement being that the solar system, including the sun, revolves around the earth (and even other stars).
It seems reasonable, because we don't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, holding 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon River, which is six miles wide, is the widest river on Earth.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows into the ocean from the rivers of this planet comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It receives water from thousands of small rivers.
Although building pyramids with stones continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza have never been surpassed in terms of their size and the technological sophistication of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments built by their predecessors, which were already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Although Latin is mainly used in religious ceremonies, Italian is the language used daily by the people working in that country.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People in ancient times were aware of basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper because these were all discovered in their native form in nature, and mining operations done with primitive tools were simple.
The philosopher Aristotle stated that everything is created by a combination of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also believed that they transformed into new substances and created what we see.
Alloys are mixtures of two (2) or more metals on a fundamental level. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, metals like gold and silver are also included.
You can obtain alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, so much so that you could fit a trillion of them in the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil, when it was produced and released, was a good friend to many people.
It is regrettable that the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and fewer uses with the advent of new writing methods.
People now write news on computer screens; they are not going to be near pencil sharpeners for writing.
When something new comes along, one can wonder what magic a keyboard can do.
A fusion bomb works on the principle of using energy to bind together a nucleus with multiple protons and neutrons.
Releasing some of that energy by splitting the nucleus again is like rolling a heavy cart up a mountain.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei. That is, they can split with or without a little disturbance.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The Moon's outermost layer is called the crust.
Its crust is about 70 km thick on the inside and 100 km thick on the outside.
It is thin under a significant amount of dark area on the Moon's surface, and thicker under the highlands.
Because the crust is thin, there may be more maria on the neighboring side. It was easy for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content principles revolve around what people prefer or what they choose.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
These theories involve observing certain individuals, making them do what they want, and analyzing what their environment will or will not make them do.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when managers lead their former peers, two types of behaviors can emerge. One end of the spectrum is "being one of the guys."
Managers like these face difficulties in making tough decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting performance reviews, delegating responsibilities, and holding their reports accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, someone transforms into an unrecognizable person who thinks that he or she should change everything the group has been doing and create it as they want.
Above all, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often creates a divide between leaders and others in the team.
Virtual teams excel similarly to traditional teams, but there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as liaisons and facilitators to their adjacent group of people.
They often have more autonomy than traditional teams, because their teams may meet across different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The presence of an invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is a unique characteristic of virtual teams.
A "shadow team" is a management team where all members announce their status to it. The shadow team will grade each member.
Why would a company want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization if the only goal of implementing organizational learning concepts is to leverage innovation?
If all departments of a company effectively utilize all available resources, creativity and intelligence will benefit everyone.
As a result, a company's process of working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's needs.
Before a company can innovate, leadership must foster a culture that implements innovation, shares knowledge with colleagues, and promotes organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains that using a continuous methodology will lead the company to achieve significant performance gains.
In cognitive science, neurological data provides concrete evidence for a theoretical approach, thereby narrowing the scope of research and making it more precise.
Brain pathology and the connection to behavior helps scientists in research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, tumors, etc., can affect behavior and cause certain changes in mood.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that were previously impossible to observe.
This provides more information and materials to construct simulation models that help us understand the workings of our minds.
While AI is highly relevant to his science fiction, AI, a crucial branch of computer science, deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
AI research involves creating machines that automate intricate tasks.
Examples include control, planning and organizing, identifying customer needs and the ability to answer questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and face.
Matters like these have become distinct disciplines, focusing on providing solutions for real-life problems.
AI systems are now predominantly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and are also incorporated into numerous home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of every classroom. A teacher would often like to take their students to places where a bus cannot travel.
Technology provides solutions through realistic virtual field trips, allowing students to view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or appreciate fine art from the comfort of their classroom.
Sharing a field trip visually is an excellent way to reflect the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, each year the students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and each year the website is redesigned, but older versions are made available online for archival purposes.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Because students are very important readers, bloggers put in a lot of effort to write their posts, avoiding controversial opinions.
Furthermore, blogs "make students curious about the world around them," and the idea of feeding the readers' curiosity encourages them to become intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
A blog is a tool that effectively promotes and facilitates collaborative learning for students, extending well beyond the traditional school day.
"The proper use of blogs 'makes students more critical and analytical; when answering online questions, it helps them to express their responses to others' opinions and take a stand of their own' (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the beautiful, bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's heritage and innovation.
In the southern corner is Niagara Falls, while to the north, Muskoka and beyond offer the unspoiled beauty of nature.
All these things further highlight how Ontario is viewed by outsiders as the quintessential Canadian.
Vast areas further north are very densely populated, while some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that may surprise many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is huge, and when it comes to wildlife, it is considered a unique continent.
Most of the small islands were either independent nations or affiliated with France, known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam, which saw significant growth in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The discovery of the Cape route from Europe to India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama in the 15th century marked the beginning of European influence and colonialism.
It is bordered by the Sahel region to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that any female passenger, regardless of their actual marital status, identify as married.
Although it doesn't seem like a very expensive one, it will be helpful for wearing the ring.
Women need to understand that cultural differences can be perceived as harassment and that things like following us and holding hands are not always normal.
Be firm in rejecting men; don't be afraid of your strong intention (whether there are cultural differences or not, it won't be right!).
Casablanca, a modern city, was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed this and rebuilt it under the name "Caza Branca" only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city of Azemmour and renamed it Dar al-Bayda, and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco(1).
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, pottery, leather products, hookahs, and a spectrum of knick-knacks, but it's mostly geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist destination in the eastern corner of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava flows from the Mount Nyiragongo volcano buried and destroyed the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma itself is relatively safe, research should be conducted to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province outside of Goma.
This city serves as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with offering some of the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. A typical short (local) ride costs ~500 Congolese Francs.
With its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for special, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a dilapidated city, yet it attracts tourists with its reputation and even has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of the world's most endangered ancient sites due to the threat of encroaching desert sands.
Among the special wonders of the African world, this was one of Henry Louis Gates' main stops during his PBS journey.
That city is completely different from the other cities in the country because it has an Arabian flavor rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and borders Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the Crocodile River in the eastern boundary.
The park spans 19,500 square kilometers and encompasses 14 types of natural biomes, supporting a diverse range of wildlife.
This is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered a flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees.
It might be more beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access to all national parks in South Africa, or a Wild Card that grants access to specific parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gave the Hong Kong territory its name and is what most travelers focus on when visiting.
Hong Kong's parade of skyscrapers has been likened to a bar graph shimmering in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront.
The majority of Hong Kong's urban development is densely located on the northern coast, on reclaimed land.
This is the place that the British colonists considered their own. So, if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is the best place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coastlines of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans forest has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The portion of the Sundarbans within the Indian border is called Sundarban National Park.
Those forests are not just mangrove forests; they also contain a final, standing fragment of the dense forests that once existed in the Ganges River Plain.
The Sundarbans forest spans an area of 3,850 km², with about one-third of it being water/swampy areas.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and is estimated to have 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east, and those for Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advisable to buy bus tickets a few days in advance, as inter-district buses are often full.
Many districts are served by small, comfortable, robust Japanese Coaster buses.
Shared taxis to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200) are a quick and convenient mode of transport.
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with the city of Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Those two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, once the Brazilian customs checkpoints are ready.
The most notable indigenous group, the Guarani, are semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers living in what is now eastern Paraguay, and they also practice subsistence agriculture.
The Saco region is home to other indigenous groups, the Huaorani and the Baihua, who live by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay was born in the 16th century from the conflict between Spanish occupiers and indigenous groups in a region formerly known as a large province of India.
The Spanish began the colonial period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since its foundation in 1537, Paraguay has maintained its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Polo Fields in Los Canitas.
Small bets and competitions can be found here at other times of the year.
For news about polo matches and where to purchase tickets, see Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged at par with the British Pound (GBP).
You can transfer money from FIC West Store to the only bank located in Stanley in the Falkland Islands.
British Pounds are widely accepted throughout the islands and in Stanley, and credit cards and US Dollars are also accepted.
Although US and British currency are accepted on the outer islands, credit cards are not, so check with the owners in advance to find out which payment methods are accepted.
Exchanging Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands is nearly impossible, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it will be summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in the humid subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures of +30 degrees C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold; the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer reads.
There isn't a specific rainy season or dry season. Rainfall is roughly consistent throughout the year.
Even though most of the animals in the park have seen humans, wild animals are still wild animals, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, you are advised to stay 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters/yards away from other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals are capable of attacking.
Every year, dozens of spectators are injured due to the failure to maintain proper distance. These animals are large, uncontrollable, and dangerous, so they should be given a separate space.
Additionally, be aware that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so keep the campsite clean, avoiding carrying or cooking fragrant foods.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was established in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was an infamously negative naval stopover when seven ships from Germany, America, and Britain refused to leave it.
Except for one British ship, all ships sank. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle, a peaceful gathering organized by the Mau movement in the city ended in the assassination of a key leader, Tubua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches due to its sprawling layout with two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The northern shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are mostly composed of sandy beaches safe for swimming, and many spots are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitematā Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded, family-friendly beaches with swimming safety, lined with shops along the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but it's sweet and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manda".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
Local tap water is generally very safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you are concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is new. It's a slightly less dark "espresso", filled with cappuccino cream (not foam), but served without tea milk.
The hot chocolates are up to Belgian standards. The juices are expensive, but excellent.
Throughout the year, many trips are made to the rocks, and injuries caused to the rocks due to these reasons are rare.
However, seek advice from authorities, follow instructions carefully, and pay extra attention to safety-related warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and riverbeds from October to April in 1770. They are rarely seen outside these times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are scared of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean in large numbers; their primary habitat is the riverbanks north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers great peace of mind, as they are assured of having a place to sleep once they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have contracts with specific hotels, but it is also possible to book other types of accommodations, such as camping grounds, through travel agents.
Typically, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or sometimes flight and hotel combinations.
They may put your reservation on hold if you need time to think about the offer or to acquire other documents for your purpose (e.g., visa).
Any changes or requests must be made through the travel agent first, not directly with the hotel.
During some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to stay at the campsite and the majority of visitors consider it the most important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to go early to get a campsite close to the music.
Even though the main stage music performance has ended, some sections of the festival will continue playing music at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
During winter, if you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea, inspect the cabin area, because traversing through ice can produce a harsh noise for the majority of those affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time to see the city, and cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check regulations).
Generally, casinos try in various ways to make guests spend as much money and time as possible. Windows and clocks are often absent, and finding the exit can also be difficult.
To keep the guests in good spirits and to keep them engaged, they have excellent food, beverage, and entertainment offerings.
In some places, shops are delivering liquor to homes. However, alcoholism reduces proper judgment, and gamblers know the importance of being sober.
Anyone driving to high altitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of frost, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On snowy and icy roads, friction is very low, and you can't drive like you're just driving on gravel.
During a snowfall, enough snow can fall in a very short time for you to get stuck.
Reduced visibility may occur due to snowfall and blowing snow, or due to ice or frost forming on car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic flows smoothly there throughout the year.
Safaris may be the best type of tour Africa has to offer and are a highlight for many visitors.
As a popular usage, the term "safari" refers to a land journey, especially to view the spectacular African wildlife in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, can be approached very closely by vehicles, and ordinary equipment allows for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes disappear, you will see them better with the help of binoculars.
Hiking (also called bushwalking, tramping, or trekking) refers to a long walk, lasting for a few hours or extending to several days.
The 2020 Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5. Some events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the games in 1964, is the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice.
You may experience some confusion if you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement date was announced.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-related cancellation policies from late March would not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Many hotels offer loaner irons and ironing boards for in-room ironing, even if they don't have valet ironing services.
If an iron is not available, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if you have one.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (as the fabric may shrink or, in extreme cases, the fabric may be scorched).
There are still several other effective ways to purify water against that specific fear.
In some areas, boiling water takes only a minute, while in others, it can take several minutes.
The efficiency of filters varies, and if you are concerned about this, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company in a sealed bottle.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar animals or destructive insects in their home regions.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst cases, trigger allergic reactions, and can also spread poison or infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous, powerful animals that can harm or kill people, are generally not referred to as insects.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with very high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, along the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, presents some of the most challenging driving conditions, as this highway winds through isolated backwoods terrain.
If you are not used to traveling on rural roads, be vigilant as you will encounter steep paths, narrow lanes, and sharp bends frequently.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than the preceding and subsequent sections—typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and adhering to them strictly is paramount.
However, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other routes in these corridors, for example, the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German pastries/dough-based goods like cakes are very good, and in Bavaria, they are as elaborate and varied as in its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, apples are cooked in pastries year-round, and cherries and plums appear in the summer.
Many cooked German foods contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes, in particular, are often a good accompaniment to a strong coffee.
If you'd like some small but rich pastries, try the Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish with a base of herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A kuzhambu can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid in it.
In North India and the inland regions of Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in cooking gravies; in South India and some coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a collective term for the wide array of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
