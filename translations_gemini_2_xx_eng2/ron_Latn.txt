USA Gymnastics supports the US Olympic Committee's letter and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and the sport they practice, can be better served by implementing significant changes within our organization than by withdrawing certification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs were covered in feathers, a widely held hypothesis, but also provides details that generally cannot be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was brown-chestnut on the upper part, with a light or orange color on the lower part.
The discovery also offers an insight into how bird feathers evolved.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but exhibit other characteristic elements of feathers – barbs and barbules – researchers have concluded that the rachis was likely an evolutionary development that appeared after the other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have suggested that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not chick fluff.
Researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not the fluff of a chick.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured over 20 people.

They discovered that the Sun functions according to the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system was proven to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used in combination to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flux.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be in terms of magnetic reversals.

He warns that no one can guarantee at this moment that any intervention in Iraq will stop the sectarian war, the escalating violence, or a slide towards chaos.
The report opens with a plea for open debate and consensus-building in the United States regarding policy towards the Middle East.
The report is extremely critical of almost every aspect of the executive's current policy towards Iraq and calls for an immediate change of direction.
The first recommendation out of the 78 he made was to launch a new diplomatic initiative before the end of this year in order to secure Iraq's borders against hostile interventions and to restore diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

The work done was largely theoretical, but the program was designed to stimulate observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would have been caused by tidal forces produced between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that the dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy like a sort of aura and is composed of a multitude of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the presence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he stated that the new variant is "very disturbing and worrying due to the very high mortality rate."
It is possible that some patients contracted the virus in the hospital, claims Doctor Moll, and at least 2 were hospital staff.
Over the course of a year, one infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom they are in close contact.
Nevertheless, the percentage of XDR-TB within the entire group of people with tuberculosis still appears to be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any one time in South Africa.

Infrared images show that temperature differences between night and day indicate the likelihood that these are caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which generally maintain a constant temperature, but it is compatible with the hypothesis that they represent deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushind of the Astrogeology Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and insert a pre-printed paper ballot indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law rather strictly codifies the procedures to be followed.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can confirm that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added, except for those of voters who are duly counted and authorized.
Candidates may send representatives to witness all stages of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following clear procedures.

The first event she participated in was the slalom, where she didn't reach the finish line on her first attempt. 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
In the other competition she participated in, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting group, with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first-place finisher, Australian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth-place competitor, Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female sit-skiers failed to complete their run, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to qualify for the competition.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen.
"Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya stated: «We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop»."
The accused are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed until emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She was detained pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony may be tainted as her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice in other areas of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have ruled that publishing photographs can be prejudicial.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that 'journalists seem to be playing with fire by publishing photos and other information about suspects.'"
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for criminal prosecution, has informed journalists that it will not be making any further comments at least until charges are filed.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants drawn based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a sacred place for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that, after the agreement is signed, it have a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while the PA is willing to accept this presence for only a period of five years.
The hunters who participated in the additional pest control test were to be closely supervised by the foresters, with the test being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited based on the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Executive Director of Conservation and Heritage for the Park at NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation benefited from comprehensive safety briefings and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), composed of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to organize elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported another 34 overheating incidents, which the company said were "not serious."
The ministry responded, saying that the delay from Apple is "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands' Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management has stated that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were rescued, and the death of at least six has been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, along with Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the place of an elderly woman who needed the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She studied obstetrics and in 1959 began working for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature labor in his spare time.
His research demonstrated that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate the pulmonary maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
His fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said that 'Luna was the original Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the double moon. A unique moment, just like she was. A strong woman.'"
Dustin Runnels, nicknamed "Goldust", commented that "Luna was just as eccentric as me... maybe even more so... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Of 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that, in her opinion, Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
34% of those interviewed agree with this opinion, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim at the Commonwealth Games in the 100m and 200m freestyle events, as well as in three relay events, but his physical condition has been questioned due to his complaints.
He couldn't take the necessary medication to control the pain, as it was prohibited during the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
Several people verified the finding before the beginning of February, using different combinations of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of Earth's water, along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political babble and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, thereby saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses technology based on the use of satellites, unlike older systems based on ground-based radar, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and transmit more precise information to pilots.
There is no additional transport available, surface trains are not stopping at Wembley, and park and ride facilities are not available in the area.
Fears regarding the lack of transportation have brought up the possibility of organizing the match behind closed doors, in the absence of the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the development of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that new species have evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer, due to reproduction between the endemic Darwin's finches, Geospiza fortis, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into a multitude of designs. It can be rolled into minuscule objects.
It can be drawn into thin wires that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued over another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. An indicator can be prepared using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (given that hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders together, and then, with clean and wet hands, form a ball out of them.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which can give you a strange sensation and lead to the formation of a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, in Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Among the Romans, toilets were sometimes found as part of public baths, which men and women used communally.
When you call someone thousands of kilometers away, you do so through a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
A huge, 100-foot-tall rocket is needed to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel offered us was a much simpler and faster way of transportation.
He brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Below them we have several medium-sized felines, which feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that prey on the much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the niche concept; each feline has its own role to fulfill, so they are not in competition with each other.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called prides.
Families consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and offspring.
The females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion families behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals with surprisingly similar behavior to lions (but not to other large felines), and also very lethal to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, make long jumps, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
Tigers belong to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar doesn't resemble the full-voiced roar of a lion, but rather a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, or birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by using their sense of smell, sniffing the ground to locate them.
Thanks to their night vision, they can see very well in the dark and move undetected. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in their environment and then pouncing on it.
When a small group of creatures (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island from which it cannot easily return), it will often find itself in a different environment than it was in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what they needed before.
The initial population hasn't changed at all, and it needs the same adaptations as before.
As time passes, and as the new population adapts to the environment, its members begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we will no longer be able to say they are the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and represents a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe in, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans breathe out (i.e., expel from their lungs).
Plants produce their own food with the help of the sun, through photosynthesis. In addition, they provide shade.
We make our houses from plants, and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, having nothing to fear except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws held over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning nothing that crossed its path escaped unscathed.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included sea turtles, large fish, other mosasaur species, and it may have even been cannibalistic.
It would also attack anything that entered the water; not even a huge dinosaur like a T-Rex could have stood a chance against it.
While much of their cuisine would be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive dishes that included wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that, while poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, rich men liked to hold banquets where they lay on their side while eating.
The cuisine of ancient Rome could not include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to answer the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were also built.
The tower's summit formed the sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was less important.
Most of a Jewish family's life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just counters that opened directly onto the street. Stone was used in the construction of the houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely colonized. The Scandinavian saga says that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further west, he found Green Land and named it Greenland.
However, regardless of the discoveries he made, tribes of Eskimos were already living in those places at that time.
Despite all being "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences in terms of population, kings, customs, and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might believe that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence, one can read the words: 'Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776'. The text appears upside down, at the bottom of the document."
Although it is not known with certainty who wrote it, it is nevertheless known that, in its early days, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was kept rolled up.
Therefore, the inscription was probably made simply for labeling.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent fighting liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was led by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working alongside the invaders instead of fighting against them.
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being named 'Operation Dragoon'."
In just two weeks, American forces alongside the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," meaning civil, being related to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state; it also defines, in a way, the size of the society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilizing culture implies the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a persistent cultural imprint, and a reasonable spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government – with Congress being its sole component – under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and because there was no executive or judicial authority at the national level, it relied on often uncooperative state authorities to enforce its decisions.
It also lacked the authority to repeal laws and tax tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states treated the central government with such nonchalance that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, are ranked second among the most successful teams in the world and were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
In Japan, there are almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to the island groups it possesses, Japan is often said to be an "archipelago" from a geographical point of view.
Taiwan's beginnings occurred a long time ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island recorded its name as Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the agricultural practices of the aboriginals and employing Chinese laborers to work on sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644 - 1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1985, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to allow tourists to get a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common static photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its proportions have been adopted by digital camera image sensor formats.
The somewhat confusing 35mm format is actually 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore stated to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format family) are identical to or very close to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often ridiculed, is nothing more than a simple suggestion for creating dynamism while maintaining some order in an image.
According to it, the best place for positioning the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the frame into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, drew attention to itself.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked European states to one another, despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds exist specifically for this reason.
For over a thousand years, the church's central authority resided in Rome, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether the principle was truly being upheld.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off the supply of vital military and civilian provisions, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, enshrined in several international agreements signed over the past two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire ocean areas, endangering even neutral vessels.
The response to this tactic being muted, Germany expected a similar reaction in the case of its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with only 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of demarcating different periods of time; each stage of China's development or each family that held power represented a distinct dynasty.
Also, the periods between consecutive dynasties were marked by divided provinces. The best-known such interval was the Three Kingdoms period, spanning 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars took place between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying fighting to occupy the throne in the magnificent palace of Xi'an.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an absolutist to a republican, nationalist system, and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, men were able to access all occupations, allowing the most ambitious and talented to achieve success.
The same was true for the military, because instead of a class-based military hierarchy, they now relied on caliber.
The French Revolution, in turn, inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohamed was deeply interested in things that transcended the earthly realm. He used to go often to meditate in a cave that became known as "Hira," located on Mount "Noor" (light).
The cave itself, having survived through time, allows us to form a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's hard to find even when you know it exists. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
The only things that can be seen are the clear and beautiful sky above and the mountains all around. Very little of this world can be glimpsed or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has remained standing to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramidal structures built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also called the "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, houses several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the tallest), several smaller tombs, a series of temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "tick mark upwards" looks like a V, while the "tick mark downwards" looks like a caret or a square missing its bottom side.
Up-bow means you start at the tip and push the bow; down-bow means you start at the frog (that is, the part of the bow you hold with your hand) and pull the bow.
An up-bow stroke usually produces a softer sound, while a down-bow stroke is more powerful and decisive.
Feel free to mark your own bowings, but remember that the printed bowings are there for musical reasons and should normally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a crowd of market women to return from Versailles to Paris.
They traveled back towards Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting and howling threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd raised the head of a member of the royal guard, killed at Versailles before the eyes of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of United States imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
These people were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime in order to bear a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the enormous profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the core gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, we must understand the context that led to the order's creation.
The period in which the events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, representing the era in European history that encompasses the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or the technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an inherent logic, associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely outside of cultural and political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
A large number of car owners leads to an increased incidence of accidents on public roads, which in turn drives the invention of new medical techniques for healing bodily injuries.
An important component of Romanticism was cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures emerged linked to that geography, and these, being in harmony with the society's location, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital in the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began to spread around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
His status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned laden with gifts such as silk and spices more valuable than what the markets of Byzantium offered.
This was the moment when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important advancements of that period was that, following the Crusades, people began using buttons for closing clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is farming carried out to produce enough food to only meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often ecological system that uses saved seeds originating from the same ecological region, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel alienated by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinct and symbolic use of characteristic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, as a result of neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children were sequestered by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the child's abandonment was due to their rejection by parents, due to severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
It is possible that feral children experienced abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; while others are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
A feral child, when raised entirely by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (within their physical limitations) almost entirely like those of the animal that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should ease and make learning more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
Scaffolding or construction site method is not a learning method, but rather an aid that provides support to people going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man from Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software to query, provide clues, and explain procedures that might otherwise be too complicated for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for numerous reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, even extending to extortion.
There shouldn't be children growing up in an environment where they lack food, love, and education, but there are.
We perceive the family care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our family care system must provide safe housing, compassionate caregivers, a solid education, and reliable healthcare.
Family care is expected to cover the needs of the children that were not being met in their previous home.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet introduce additional dimensions to the approach regarding types of uses and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that one can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting facial microexpressions.
In his work "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks demonstrated how individuals who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination cause the direction of variation to be dominated by one or the other of the two gene pools in each generation.
In the savanna, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to satisfy its amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to do so carries severe consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources were proteins from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
Unlike these, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides large amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Considering all of this, it shouldn't surprise us if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a similar way to chimpanzees in the savannas of today.
Sleep interruption is the procedure by which you intentionally wake yourself up during your normal sleep period in order to fall back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a relatively quiet alarm clock, to bring you to a conscious state without fully waking you up.
If you happen to snooze your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking liquids (especially water or tea, which have diuretic effects) before bed, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.
The inner peace a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Everyone has the possibility to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is one's own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but with the addition of the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, clashes of system, process, and culture led to the estrangement of the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War was beginning.
It was to last forty years and would be fought fiercely, by "proxy" armies, on battlefields spread from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, the plans became useless almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army were mobilized, creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after they invaded eastern Poland, violating the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transporting goods is by far the most efficient way to transport both goods and people from one side of the oceans to the other.
Traditionally, the role of a navy has been to ensure a country's ability to move people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the more notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have succeeded in occupying Great Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them near their homes for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, usually under the care of goatherds who were often children or adolescents, similar to the well-known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though these wagonways consisted only of wooden planks laid in parallel, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than they could on the somewhat irregular roads of that time.
Crossbeams were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually concluded that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal band on top.
This became a widespread practice, but the iron led to faster wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were produced.
The first known means of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specialisation is found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may already have been walking bipedally seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is evident that the world has changed greatly as a result of scientific and technological advancements, and the problems are greater now due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's print shop, located a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies, known as "Dunlap broadsides," were made.
On July 8th, the first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 surviving Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But in birds, many characteristics similar to dinosaurs can still be seen.
They have scaly feet with claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only contain one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits, in computer science jargon.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis might not be possible.
The best clue for internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Consult the label for first aid instructions regarding that specific poison.
The term "beetle" is used by entomologists specifically for this group of insects.
The term originates from the old resemblance to bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), meaning it is the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may come to the conclusion that raising a child is in neither their best interest nor the child's.
These couples can choose to formulate an adoption plan for their child.
In the event of an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to figure out how the world works, using the scientific method. This method is applied in most scientific research.
However, it's not the only thing; experimentation and an experiment, which is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, along with asking questions and making observations, also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers primarily used classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's ideas about all aspects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language dwindled, the West found itself severed from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that will continue to function for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the most important pieces of evidence supporting the hypothesis that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, a type of virus, to inject their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments, marking either the bacteriophage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Organized tourism centered around nature exploration attracts people interested in visiting natural environments to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife and vegetation.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example would be visiting, photographing, and learning more about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small rural settlements to get to their jobs, passing others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this heavily carbon-based economy has dislodged the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
Similar levels of dissatisfaction regarding water quality or bridge collapses are rarely encountered in developed countries.
Why is it that transportation systems generate such dissatisfaction, why do they fail day after day? Is it simply because transportation engineers are incompetent? Or is something more serious happening?
Traffic flow studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
Studying traffic flow is unfortunately difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute precision.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to remain within reasonably constant limits; as a result, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be mathematically approximated.
To better represent traffic flow, we need to establish relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to begin flying. The ability to fly allowed them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mates much more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some considered him to be right, but many believed the opposite; namely, that the Solar System actually revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable because we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries over 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching a width of six miles in some places.
No less than 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the world's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller bodies of water.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size or in the technical mastery of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians who lived during the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments built by their predecessors, which at that time were already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by most of those who work in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of the Vatican are Roman Catholic.
People have known some fundamental chemical elements since antiquity, such as gold, silver, and copper, because they can be found in nature in their native state and are quite easy to extract using simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed a theory that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were water, earth, air, and fire.
It was more reminiscent of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he had theorized that it transforms into another substance to take the form we see.
Alloys are actually combinations of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You will see that some alloys can also include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Consequently, the pencil became the friend of many after it was created.
Unfortunately, as newer writing instruments emerged, the pencil lost its status and number of uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever needing to pick up a pencil sharpener.
You can only wonder what the fate of the keyboard will be when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no impetus.
The Moon's surface is composed of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker in areas with higher relief.
There might be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on identifying the elements that attract people's attention or give them pleasure.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized with development until maturity.
These theories study what motivates some people to want to do what they do, and what aspects of their environment may cause them to do, or not do, certain things.
Two popular theories regarding content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of behavior can emerge when managers start leading former colleagues. One extreme involves trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, people turn into unrecognizable individuals who believe they must change everything the team has done and proceed in their own style.
Ultimately, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often, this behavior leads to rifts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but subtle differences exist.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for the physical group they are part of.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as their teams may meet according to different time zones, which might not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The invisible team" is the management team that each of the members reports to. The invisible team sets the standards for each of the members.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can manifest freely.
Consequently, the process by which an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative process for meeting customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data represent physical evidence that underlies a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. As such, it allows for narrowing the scope of research and defining it with greater precision.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before seen.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material for building simulation models, which help us understand the processes that take place in our minds.
Despite the fact that AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI is a very important part of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and adaptation of intelligence in machines.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Such actions have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is now frequently used in fields like economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, but it has also been used in some software applications for personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of any class. Often, a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus trip isn't possible.
Technology offers the solution with virtual tours. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while in the classroom.
Virtually sharing a field trip outcome is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; each year the website is redesigned, and previous versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve a student's writing skills. While students often begin their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the existence of an audience generally has the gift of changing the situation.
Given that students often represent the most critical audience, the blog author is beginning to make efforts to improve their writing and avoid criticism.
"Furthermore, blogging 'forces students to be more aware of the world around them.' The need to respond to their audience's interests inspires students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004)."
Blogging is a tool that fosters collaboration and encourages students to extend their studies far beyond the regular school day.
"The appropriate use of blogs «can help students think more analytically and critically; by actively responding to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of what others have written, as well as outline their own perspectives on certain issues» (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, offering a wealth of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, while the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muskoka district and much more.
These and many other things highlight Ontario as representative of what foreigners consider quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost unpopulated wilderness.
Here's a comparison between populations that surprises many: the number of African Americans living in the US is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The eastern islands of Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a true continent of its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France, and are renowned as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to those lands, which was very successful in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who travels should say she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's good to wear a wedding ring, but it shouldn't look expensive.
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can lead to what might be considered harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be firm when you reject a man and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it still doesn't mean it's OK!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was used as a strategic port by Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, being called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, who rebuilt it, calling it Casa Branca, but they abandoned it again in 1755, following an earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who had established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a lot of all sorts of trinkets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the settlement's streets, especially the central area.
While Goma is a relatively safe place, for visits outside the city it is necessary to make an effort to gather information to understand the state of the fighting that is still taking place in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and offers some of the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis). The usual (local) price for a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
Alongside its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used metaphorically to mean exotic, remote places.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger due to the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, African Wonders of the World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has a more Arabic than African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordered by the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the country's national parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are entry and daily conservation fees for the park.
It might also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry into either a series of parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks.
The name of the territory Hong Kong comes from Hong Kong Island and is the place many tourists see as its central point.
The exhibition of buildings that contribute to Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a shimmering bar chart, enhanced by the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
To enjoy the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon, on the other side of the water.
The largest area of the developed urban part of Hong Kong Island is crammed onto reclaimed land along the northern coasts.
This is the space that British colonizers appropriated, and therefore, for anyone seeking evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps, though - they also encompass some of the last strongholds of the vast jungle that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 km², of which about one-third is covered by water/swamp.
Beginning in 1966, the Sundarbans became a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although the majority, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses connecting the districts are often full, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Sharing a taxi is a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby attractions, such as Paro (150 Nu) or Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
With its two pylons rising to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important group of indigenous people living in what is now Eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Gigantic Province of the Indies," originated in the 16th century after Spanish conquistadors encountered indigenous groups there.
The Spanish began the period of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the city of Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has strived to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is renowned for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches also take place here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged at par to the pound sterling (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, directly opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the outer islands, although they will likely accept British and American currency; contact the owners in advance to find out what payment methods they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland pounds outside of the country, so you need to exchange them before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures frequently reach over 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the presence of wind and high humidity have the combined effect of making the perceived chill more intense than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, moose, bears, and almost all other large animals can attack humans.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so it's best to give them their space.
Besides this, be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so it would be advisable to avoid strong-smelling foods and maintain cleanliness in the campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a sadly remembered naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the Mau movement's fight for independence, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to Auckland's location between two harbors. The most famous of these are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district), located on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most have shade from pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, from downtown Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, with a wide array of shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One"; it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can find many French wines, but New Zealand or Australian ones would be better.
The local tap water is drinkable, but if you have any concerns, you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is unusual. A short black coffee is an "espresso", a cappuccino comes overflowing with whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian quality standards. The fruit juices are pricey, but very good.
Many visit the reef throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. Occasionally, it can be found outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are scared of people and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles don't actually live in the ocean, their primary habitat being in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance offers the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with certain hotels, but through a travel agent you can also make reservations for other forms of accommodation, such as campsites.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even packages that combine flights and hotel accommodations.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
Any changes or requests should be directed to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of festivals, the vast majority of participants in music festivals choose to camp on-site, and most participants consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to arrive early to snag a campsite near the music.
Remember that while the music on the main stages has ended, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic Sea in winter, be mindful of the cabin's location, as navigating through ice produces an unbearable noise for the most sensitive.
Cruises from St. Petersburg also include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
As a general rule, casinos make every effort to maximize the time spent there by customers and the money they spend. Usually, there are no windows or clocks, and the exits can be hard to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the good mood going and the guests staying at the establishment.
Some venues offer complimentary alcoholic drinks. However, intoxication affects judgment, and good players know how important it is to stay lucid.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or through mountain passes must consider the possible presence of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you can't drive like you would on dry asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to leave you stranded.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, condensation, or the formation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic flows mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa's main tourist attraction and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari, as it is commonly used, refers to overland journeys undertaken to see the stunning wildlife of Africa, especially that of the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and the standard equipment will allow a good view of them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll be able to see them better using binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "safari hike", or "on foot") consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations within Japan.
Tokyo, which also hosted the 1964 Olympics, will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may face a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, coronavirus-related cancellation policies did not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow, even if they aren't in the room.
If you don't have an iron available, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer if you have one handy.
Be careful not to let the material get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in others, several minutes are required.
Filters vary in their efficiency levels, and if you're concerned, consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with back home.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritations, or, in severe cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread venom, or spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person using physical force, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping offers you the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers planning to visit countries with high taxes can sometimes save considerable sums, especially when it comes to products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging traffic conditions along the entire Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated and undeveloped areas.
If you're used to driving on country roads, don't lose control: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and dangerous curves are common.
Speed limits are significantly lower than in previous sections – generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and it is all the more important to adhere to them strictly.
However, quite bizarrely, cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples being used throughout the year, and cherries and plums making their appearance in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Often, popular cakes go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small, but rich pastries, taste what, depending on the region, are called Berliners, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "liquid" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry sauces; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
Used without further qualification, however, the term tends to indicate food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a range of simply seasoned dishes, with peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various fragrant spices being the predominant flavors favored by the Javanese.
The stirrups support the rider's feet, hanging on either side of the saddle.
These offer the rider better stability, but can pose safety problems as a rider's feet may get stuck in them.
If a rider falls from the saddle but remains with one foot caught in the stirrup, the horse can drag them along if it bolts. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by a rider falling from the saddle.
Cochamo Valley - the most sought-after climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of walls and high granite peaks.
The peaks offer breathtaking views from their summits. Climbers from all over the world are constantly charting new routes among the walls with unlimited potential.
Snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular activities that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums" in English, who organize entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is extremely old – we have cave paintings depicting skiers from as early as before 5000 BCE!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is a related activity, but one that typically does not involve alpine ski touring or mountaineering, the latter of which are carried out on much steeper terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat longer distances than walking – but you will very rarely be able to reach speeds typical for cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack, on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, traveling through several countries would mean going through visa application and passport control procedures repeatedly.
In this sense, the Schengen Area is organized somewhat like a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to do so at passport control points.
Similarly, someone with a Schengen visa does not need to obtain a visa for each individual Schengen member country, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition to determine which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies consider goods older than 100 years to be antiques.
The definition varies depending on geographical location, where the age limit might be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be defined as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of income among the Sami, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many who have other occupations.
However, traditionally not all members of the Sámi population were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather lived from fishing, hunting, and the like, using reindeer more as pack animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi people have modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "țigan" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and an incorrect perception of the Roma population.
If the country you are about to visit is subject to a travel warning, it may affect your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You may also wish to consult advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
An example would be how American citizens from the Middle East might face different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
The tips are just a brief summary of a country's political situation.
Opinions are often presented superficially, generally, and oversimplified, compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Extreme weather conditions" is a generic term used for any type of dangerous meteorological phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and are of various types, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and uncontrolled wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of the risks of severe weather affecting the area, as it could disrupt their travel plans.
It is advisable for anyone planning to travel to a country that may be considered a war zone to undergo professional training.
An internet search for "hostile environment course" will likely provide you with the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will address all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, usually through practical experience.
A course will usually last between 2-5 days and will include role-playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are quite numerous, but publications addressing war zones are few.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery in another country must ensure they possess valid documents for their return journey.
The openness of governments to the possibility of issuing passports that do not declare sex (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and sex is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
Searches at checkpoints have also become much more intrusive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to go through scanners without their privacy and dignity being affected.
Rip currents are the flow of water returning to the ocean from waves breaking on the beach, often at a reef or similar formation.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid current towards the deep waters can form there.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current, which can prove to be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming is no more difficult than normal.
Try to move to a position where you won't get caught again, and depending on your abilities and whether or not someone saw you, you might want to wait to be rescued.
Reverse culture shock manifests faster than culture shock (less honeymoon phase euphoria remains), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to a new culture sometimes encounter particular difficulties in readjusting to their native culture.
If you were to return home after living abroad, you would have already adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits from your native culture.
When you had barely left to go abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, being aware that visiting a new country involves a process of adaptation.
The world doesn't always expect patience and understanding to be necessary towards travelers returning home.
The sound and light show organized at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the entire area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you can constantly hear the noise made by tourists and vendors. The sound and light show seems to be taken from a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as a backdrop and narrator for a long story.
The scenes are displayed on pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen being active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
The region in the south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea, is called Ellsworth Land.
The Peninsula's mountains converge to give rise to this plateau, then separate again to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains range, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, called the Sentinel Range, lie the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising to 4892 m.
In remote locations with no phone signal, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone generally cannot replace a cellular phone because you need to be outside with an unobstructed view of the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is frequently used in maritime transport, including by recreational craft, as well as by expeditions requiring remote data and voice transmission.
Your local phone service provider may be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular alternative for people planning a gap year is to combine travel with studying.
It is a popular activity, especially among graduates, allowing them to take a year off before attending university without jeopardizing their educational path.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year abroad can actually increase your chances of accessing higher education in your home country.
Typically, there is a tuition fee that is paid upon enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a wonderful place for canoeing. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in these lakes and in the archipelagos on the coast.
In archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos off the coasts and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national recreational activity, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
This happens in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is 1 in 40).
Most dedicated Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historical city for several full days, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only go ashore for excursions while onboard a ship, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is in no way near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they are flying for the first time or have had a traumatic experience.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and dislikes of other things, which manifest in many people.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can be helpful in overcoming fear that is based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are well-paid for fast deliveries. Often, delivery time is critical when it comes to documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies own their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they sent something by air, on some routes it can take days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to make him get through faster was to send him as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to pay a hefty sum for the privilege (or, even better, to convince your company to do it for you).
However, it's not cheap: in general, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and up to eleven times more for first class!
Generally, it's not even worth looking for discounts on business class or first class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge fares accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered as a result of an inter-ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (Transnistria) in the eastern part of Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a bustling, developed, and modern commercial center situated around a huge gulf and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, alongside glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centers, are equipped with traditional 18th-century red-tile roofs, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above some graves.
It's worth spending half an hour strolling through this amazing village.
To the north, easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became known beyond the country's borders following an enthusiastic review of its splendors by Lord Byron.
The Scottburb 403 bus runs a regular service to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the northern part you can visit the Sanctuary of the Holy Virgin of Fatima, a place known worldwide for the apparitions of St. Mary.
Please note that you are essentially visiting the site of a mass grave, as well as a site of almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived internment there, and many more who had family members who were killed or forced to work to death there, both Jews and others.
You are asked to treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by drawing and scratching on the existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only made in Catalan, as it is established by law as the primary official language.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transportation, alongside other services.
Regular announcements on the metro are only made in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced by an automated system in various languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although often just a stereotype that doesn't match reality, to have a pleasant stay in Paris, it's good to behave as well as possible, like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will help you get along much more easily.
The reserved attitude of Parisians quickly transforms into a friendly one if you show a minimum of politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily wooded, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and has a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It hosts a considerable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soil types, and altitude levels.
The region also harbors an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be found here, along with many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer head coverings for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in vibrant colors, you'll receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that cover their knees.
And these can be borrowed from those available at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used in abundance.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes, with any available toppings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word "Sie," which means "you," are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to discover the possibility of a verb or adjective being used in a substantivized form.
The pronunciation of Italian words is relatively easy, with most being pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters you need to pay more attention to are 'c' and 'g', because their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, be careful to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: "caro" means dear, while "carro" means cart.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Evidently, someone who knows a Romance language will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a little Spanish may prematurely conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it doesn't need to be studied.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete nowadays and remain open as museums or educational venues.
Since light pollution wasn't as big of a problem during their heyday, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, making them more easily accessible than those built in our times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations located in isolated areas with favorable weather conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been an integral part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the chosen flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of the Imperial Court aristocracy.
Plants never look better than in their natural environment, so don't give in to the temptation to pick even "just one" of them.
If you visit a formally landscaped garden, collecting "specimens" will also lead to your expulsion, without argument.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place, where you can easily get around and buy almost anything as soon as you arrive.
But being located in the "higher tropics," only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to face both the heat (always) and the intense sun (when it's clear, which is less frequent).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the place where, according to tradition, the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were buried, along with their wives.
Check if the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not to Kiryat Arba, the nearby Jewish settlement.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for organizing a vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to sites on the Danube, or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions related to this holiday have been adopted by both non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of staying awake on Easter night, outdoors, to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are explanations for this tradition in Christian theology, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during Holy Week, with congregations often gathering at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that initially arrived on islands came here either by swimming, flying, or drifting.
Due to the distance from the continent, mammals failed to make the journey, resulting in the giant tortoise being the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be, more or less, dark at that time.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are accustomed to.
Suits are the standard attire in the business environment, and colleagues address each other using last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is an essential element, with emphasis placed on group effort rather than individual achievements.
Workers often need to obtain approval from their superiors for all decisions they make and are expected to unquestioningly follow their superiors' instructions.
