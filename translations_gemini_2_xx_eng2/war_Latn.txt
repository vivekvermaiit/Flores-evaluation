USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and embraces the Olympic family's absolute need to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, may be better served by moving forward with meaningful change within our organization, rather than decertification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils usually don't provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal has chestnut-brown fur on top with a pale or carotenoid color underneath.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but possessed other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—the researchers suggest that the rachis was a later evolutionary development compared to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for maintaining temperature or display. Researchers suggest that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of an adult and not the skin of a hatchling.
Researchers advise that, even though it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the sample shows adult-like feathers and not the skin of a chick.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and wounding more than twenty other people.
The governor's office stated that nineteen of the injured were police officers.
The police said they suspect that an alleged Daesh (ISIL) militant was responsible for the attack.
They understood that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all stars in the system is understood to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to understand the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

Most of the work done was theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations made in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team is looking for can be produced by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon's pull on Earth causes tides, so too does the Milky Way exert force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists say that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as regular matter.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is found in a halo around the galaxy, and that it is made up of a vast number of tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In a conversation, he said that the new variant is "terribly frightening and alarming because of the very high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll suspects that some patients may have contracted the germ in the hospital, and at least two of the hospital's health workers did as well.
Within a year, one infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: the voter is alone in a booth, placing a pre-printed paper stating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter will drop the envelope into the ballot box and sign the voting roll.
The French election law strictly codified the processes.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there were no envelopes at the beginning of the voting and that no envelopes were added except for those of the counted and authorized voters.
The candidates may send their representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile and laptop."
The accused were identified as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused were presented in court with their faces covered.
Even though three people were inside the house when the car crashed, none of them were injured.
Meanwhile, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while emergency services helped the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterward, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was always at Edinburgh Sheriff Court, facing charges for the murder of her child.
He is in custody awaiting trial and arraignment, but any evidence found may be tainted because his image has already been circulated to the public.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the justice system operates differently in Scotland, and the court viewed the publication of the photos as potentially distressing.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said that "journalists appear to be walking a dangerous line when publishing photos and other things of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is handling the case, informed reporters that no further comment would be issued, at least until the trial.
According to sources, the document points to border disputes, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Mideast War.
Some of the discussed topics that were released include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a continued military presence in the mountains for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA is only agreeing to such a presence for five years.
Pest control shooters in additional trials should be checked by the guards, because the trials are being monitored and their effectiveness is being observed.
In collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director Park Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first culling operation received comprehensive clearance and training instruction.
Martelly swore in the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the early resignation of the COMELEC chairperson as part of a move to transition the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's proposed solution to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes-violent protests were triggered by the failed conduct of elections, some dating back to 2011.
Around 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods due to overheating have been recorded, resulting in a total of six fires that gave four people minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said it is aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more incidents of overheating, which the company called "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delayed reporting "very malicious".
The earthquake occurred in Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT Friday).
The emergency management office in the Northern Marianas said that no national disasters were reported to them.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Shortly after, the photographers exchanged places with the elderly woman because she needed to use a sink. Mendoza was shot and died.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature labor during his spare time.
His research shows that if the hormone is managed, it can accelerate lung maturation in the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators had recovered the two 'black box' recorders from the flight on Wednesday.
Luna was also honored by her fellow wrestlers.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the very first Queen of Extreme. My very first manager. Luna died on a night with two moons. One of a kind just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as fond of making people laugh as I am...maybe even more so...I loved her and I will miss her...I hope she is in a good place."
Aside from the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, opposition to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The caregiver admitted that Prime Minister Julia Gillard, during the 2010 federal election campaign, believed that Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the poll share the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
At the conclusion of the poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic soon, while 31 percent believe that Australia should not become a republic.
An Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints his fitness was questioned.
She couldn't take the medicine needed to help ease the pain because the Mulay forbade it.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science teacher at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people have confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may have been responsible for delivering water to Earth along with organic substances that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to learn how planets were formed, especially how Earth was formed, because comets have been colliding with Earth since then.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the stories as "political tales and nonsense."
It is estimated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system proclaimed by the FAA that allows airplanes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, in contrast to the old ground-radar-based technology, which allows air traffic control to pinpoint aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no additional vehicles deployed, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and park-and-ride facilities will be unavailable underneath.
Fears of transportation shortages have increased the possibility that the games will be forced to be played behind closed doors without any group supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Island.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that new species can evolve in as little as two generations, even though this process was believed to take longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into different shapes. It can be rolled into very small forms.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made extremely thin and adhered to other metals. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of Hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms are made of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders, and then, using clean hands, squeeze them together to form a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, becoming oily to the touch and forming a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled in mixed company.
If you call a person who is a thousand miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a signal and then immediately sends it back down.
The satellite is sent into space using a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us easier and faster transportation.
It brought us the train, car, and many other transportation equipment.
Beneath this is just the right size for cats that eat just the right size of prey, from rabbits to antelopes and one other.
Eventually, many small cats (including feral domestic cats) fed on smaller prey such as insects, rats, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of adapting to the environment, a specialized task for each individual cat to avoid competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three adult males, along with up to thirty females and their young.
The women are usually close to each other, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that act similarly to lions (but are not big cats), and can also kill their prey.
A skilled athlete, the tiger can climb (even awkwardly), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four cats that can roar.
A tiger's growl is not the same as the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a voicing of fierce, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They prey on monkeys, snakes, lizards, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot catches are smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by scent, which they smell on the ground.
They can see well even in the dark with night vision, and they also move stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on their victim.
If a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they came from (such as if they move to a mountain or a river, or if they move to a new island so they can't quickly move back), they often find themselves in a different environment than where they lived before.
This new environment has diverse resources and diverse competitors, so the new population will need diverse qualities or adaptations to be a strong competitor against what they needed before.
The original population has not changed much, and they still need the same adaptation as before.
As time passed, as the new population began to adapt to their new environment, they began to be seen as becoming less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will become so different in appearance that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe, and they also absorb carbon dioxide that people release (this is what happens when we exhale).
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and our clothes are made from plants. Plants are what we usually eat. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it had nothing to fear, except for other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw is filled with rows of 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set on the roof of its mouth, meaning nothing can escape that crosses its path.
We cannot be certain, but it is possible that it had a forked tongue. Its diet consisted of turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been cannibalistic.
It also attacks anything that enters the water, and even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex is no match for it.
While we may be familiar with most of their food, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich preferred to socialize where they reclined on their sides while eating their food.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods, which they considered to be the dwelling place of the god.
The people will offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests will strive to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special towers shaped like pyramids, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower is a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house is not important.
Much of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The women are cooking in the yard; the stores are just open stalls seen on the street. Stone is used for building houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, which is why wood was very expensive.
Only a few people live in Greenland. In Norse sagas, they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and during a voyage further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But even after his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Even though each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, monarchs, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But, this isn't true. Even if there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The texts can be seen at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at one point in his life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, the notation might have been added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
This was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were the French people who negotiated peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked for them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the southern part of France, an invasion called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a complex culture shared by a significant large group of people who live and work collaboratively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and in the same way describes the size of society.
City-states are the origin of nations. A culture of civilization explains the passing of knowledge to several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and equal dissemination.
Most of the smaller cultures disappear without leaving evidence related to history and failing to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—composed of the Congress—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any power to enforce taxes, and, having no executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who were sometimes uncooperative, to implement all of its actions.
They still do not have the authority to prevent tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles require unanimous consent from all states before they can be amended, and the states disregarded the central government, which was only supposed to note the absence of their representatives.
The Italy national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, which Italians compete in at international games and Olympic events.
Japan holds nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to Japan's cluster/group of islands, it is often referred to, geographically speaking, as an "archipelago."
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when passing European navigators recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in native rice production activities and employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) seized control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three primary structures, named the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the analog film era.
It is still being done today, but the aspect ratio is more important, following the digital camera image sensor formats.
Actually, the 35mm format seems confusing, it's 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio for this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (APS family of formats, for example) match or closely approximate this aspect ratio.
The most abused and often derided rule of thirds is simply a guide to creating dynamism while maintaining a sense of balance in an image.
This suggests that the most effective places for the main subject are at the intersections of lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, was subjected to scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion unified the states of Europe despite differences in language and custom.
Its pervasive power affects everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the main beliefs of Christians is that wealth should be used to alleviate hardship and poverty, and that church funds are specifically for that reason.
The center of the Church's authority has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and that concentration of power and money raises many questions about whether these beliefs are being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violates some widely accepted international laws established by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering an entire section of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Because there were limited responses to this tactic, Germany awaited a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his first job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different points in time; each state of China or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
And even within each dynasty, there was the unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which occurred for 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these times, fierce battles occurred between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to sit on the highest throne in the grand palace of Xi'an.
Many social and political effects occurred, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the people own the nation and not just a single ruler.
Even after the Revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
It's still the same for the military because instead of basing the ranks of the military on class, it's now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other poor working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this worldly life. He would frequently go to a cave that became known as "Hira'" on Mount "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, having survived the ages, provides a clear image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave was completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, this is not easy to find even if one knows it exists. Once inside the cave, the isolation is complete.
There was nothing else to see but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world could be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" mark looks like a V and the "down bow" mark looks like a staple or a square without its bottom part.
"Up" means you need to start at the tip and push the bow, and "down" means you need to start at the frog (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
Generally, the up-bow produces a softer sound, while the down-bow is louder and more forceful.
Feel free to pencil in your own markings, but remember that the printed bowing marks are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to return from Versailles on October 6, 1789, due to a riotous group of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a turbulent crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the King and Queen.
The unruly mob forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
On one occasion a member of the unruly mob paraded the head of a royal guard, who had been murdered at Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The costs of the U.S. imperialist war during the colonization of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and the interest on bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the huge profits derived from the long exploitation of Filipinos constitute the primary beneficiary of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which these events occurred is commonly called the High Middle Ages, a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas about technology's role, from technology-push or technological imperative to the strict definition that human destiny is driven by an inherent logic involving the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism adhere to two main ideas: that technological progress itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology also has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that the motor car necessitated the improvement of roads.
However, a nationwide network would not be economically viable for only a few cars, so a new manufacturing method was developed to reduce the cost of ownership.
Owning a large number of cars leads to a high incidence of road accidents, which necessitates the invention of new methods of treatment for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism has a strong element of cultural determinism, which it drew from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures related to this geography emerged, and these, uniting in the place of society, were superior to artificially imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its recognition as a center of importance began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
His status declined in the twelfth century due to the fact that the Crusades returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were more valuable than those offered in the markets of Byzantium.
That was the time when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
At the beginning, Byzantine culture had a great influence on clothing in the East.
However, due to the slow channels of communication, the style from the west lags behind by about 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest achievements of the era, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began using buttons to fasten their clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is done for the production of food that is just enough to provide for the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses gathered seeds native to the ecoregion mixed with crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers have worked in subsistence agriculture, and this remains the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel alienated from societal norms and allow them to foster a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that identify a distinct subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these things.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, customs, and unique vocabulary.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of attachment is to take some heartbreaking cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were deprived of attachment to adults while they were growing up.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been imprisoned by people (often their own parents); in some cases this abandonment of children is due to parental rejection of severe intellectual or physical defects in the child.
Aggressive children may have experienced severe abuse as children or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some are alleged to have been raised by animals; others are rumored to have lived alone in the forest.
If fully raised by non-human animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limitations) almost entirely like that particular caregiver animal, such as its fear or disregard for humans.
While project-based learning can make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding adds another layer.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a support that provides assistance to individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can exist both virtually and in reality, meaning teachers are a form of scaffold, but so is the little paperclip person in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are incorporated into software and designed to prompt, explain, and clarify procedures that might challenge a student to work independently.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is uncaring, unmindful, and uneducated, but they do.
We see the Foster Care System as a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, reliable education, and dependable healthcare.
Foster care should provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet has merged the elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique nature of the internet has led to increased scrutiny regarding its use and strategies for providing enjoyment.
For example, "information" and "social interaction" have been suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" were also recognized as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated viewers' reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of subtle expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that one can discern if a person is lying by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, stated how people who do not understand the speech due to brain damage can nevertheless still understand the sincerity correctly.
He even suggests that such an ability to interpret human behavior might also be given to animals such as familiar dogs.
Research in the twentieth century suggests that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination reshuffle the variation repeatedly between the two groups in each generation.
Out in the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino-acid requirements from available plant sources.
Furthermore, the failure to do this has serious consequences: slow growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant-based sources to obtain are proteins from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (insects, ants, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a high amount of protein with all the necessary amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimps in the forest do today.
Sleep polyphasic is a process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleeping hours and then going back to sleep shortly thereafter (10–60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a soft, gentle alarm clock to bring you to a state where you're not fully awake.
If you find yourself snoozing the alarm clock, you can put it in a different part of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Some biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to sleep, forcing one to get up to urinate.
The amount of peace within a person is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive forces there are in life. Each person has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacles in the way of this goal are our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it is augmented by the Mahayana path of compassion and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Deity. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and the wisdom of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common adversary during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures brought about the fall of nations.
In the two years after the war, the former allies were now adversaries, and the Cold War began.
This will last for the next 40 years with real fighting, through proxy soldiers, in conflicts from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the defense of Poland had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize near the Romanian bridgehead.
But, these plans became useless overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarussian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is currently the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional job of the navy is to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and things, while at the same time, disrupting the ability of your opponent to move their people and things.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have conquered Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were likely first domesticated nearly 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Historically, cultures and tribes began domesticating them for the quick acquisition of milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats are usually placed in herds that roam the hills or other pastures, often cared for by young herders, similar to the more well-known shepherds. This method of herding is still used today.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the railways were simply made of uniform wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and to haul larger loads compared to the somewhat more difficult roads of the earlier period.
Crossties were introduced earlier to hold the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be better if they had a steel component on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more damage to the wooden-wheeled wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
The earlier ones, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as a matter of course.
Bipedal specializations are evident in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living environmentally friendly lives, we can help with environmental movements, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering in some areas.
This is just a symptom of treating many cases. But, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems, and we need to eliminate them.
It is very clear that the world has changed greatly due to human advancements in science and technology, and the problems have become more numerous due to overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyle of people.
After its adoption by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and live on today. We call them birds.
Many people didn't think of them as dinosaurs because they had feathers and could fly.
But there are many things about birds that seem the same as dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk using their two legs in the back like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on manipulating information in the encoded form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are too general for a quick diagnosis to be made.
The best indication of poisoning indoors may be the presence of an open container of medicine or poisonous chemicals in the house.
Refer to the label for specific instructions regarding that particular thread.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is derived from the familiar Sudlot, insects well-known as human parasites.
Both assassin bugs and Sudlot are nidicolous, adapted to live in the nest or home of the host.
Throughout the United States of America, there are an estimated 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disorder in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Researchers have found that women are twice as likely to develop MS compared to men.
A married couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their children.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works in a scientific way. This approach to truth guides most scientific research.
Even though it is not done in isolation, experimentation, and an experiment are a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations, and also guide scientific investigation.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all historical discussions in science, including psychology.
As the knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific origins.
Many rhythms are observed in physiology, and behavior often depends on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just simple responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for a wide variety of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will maintain a free-running period of cycling, even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germ-line cells.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, as well as the plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include trapping, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, taking photos, and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small town by car to go to their workplaces, and some of them pass by the destination of their work which is the very place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transport, everything seems connected and supports a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Science has shown that the largest carbon economy has shifted the biosphere away from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why have transportation systems become the cause of such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to react within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flow tends to exhibit some reasonable uniformity and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic behavior, relationships were established between the three primary identifiers: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more quickly and find food and mates more effectively.
Generally, insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back against their bodies.
It gives them a wider area in a small space to hide from their predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are flies, dragonflies, and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people believed he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because it's not obvious that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles in width.
The entire 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's length is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size of the Giza pyramids and the technical sophistication of their construction were never surpassed.
The New Kingdom of the ancient Egyptians marveled at their earlier monuments, which were already well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City reaches about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is still the everyday language used by most state employees, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the fundamental chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they are all discoverable in nature in native form and relatively easy to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed a theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of the four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
This is most analogous to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also offered a theory that they transform into new components to form what we see.
Alloys are usually mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them could fit on the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Sadly, as new methods of writing advanced, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and usage.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens, no longer needing to approach a typewriter.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard if something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle of needing energy to force together a nucleus that has many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a cart up a hill. The reformation of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they decay easily with little or no provocation.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is almost 70 km thick in nearby areas and 100 km thick in distant areas.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the mountains.
There might still be magma in the nearby area because the crust is thinner. It's easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have needs and/or desires that are applicable while they are at the right age or maturity.
These theories look at how people's desires influence what they do and what things in their environment can make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In the overall story, two patterns can emerge as managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager struggles with making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning accountability, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, one could be an unknown individual who feels they need to change everything the group is doing and do it their own way.
After everything, the leader is the most responsible for the success and failure of the group.
This behavior often results in misunderstandings between leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are held to the same performance standards as conventional teams, but with some slight differences.
Members of the virtual team often serve as the point of contact for their immediate physical team.
They usually have more autonomy than regular team members because their team might be spread across different time zones that their local manager may not understand.
Having a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p109) is still a distinct part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management group to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One purpose for training in organizational learning concepts is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively used across a beneficial department in an organization, creativity and knowledge can occur.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome a difficulty can lead to new innovative processes to deliver customer needs.
For an organization to be innovative, the leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as the sharing of knowledge and wisdom within the organization.
Angel (2006) described the Continuum approach as a way that is used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating learning. Thus, it narrows the scope of research and makes it more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause alterations in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that were previously unseen.
This gives us a lot of information to create simulation models that can help us understand the processes in our minds.
Even though AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI forms one of the most important branches of computer science, involving the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling, planning, and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are increasingly used today in fields like economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being present in some home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher wants to take their students to places where a bus trip isn't an option.
Technology provides solutions for virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is still a good way to showcase a trip and experiences to future classes.
For example, every year the students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, every year the website content is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can still help improve students' writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer is striving to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to be more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to cater to the interests of an audience inspires students to be insightful and engaging. (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the writings of others as well as outline their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the beautiful, bilingual capital of Canada and has many art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south of Niagara Falls and to the north lies the habitat of untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and many more contribute to Ontario being considered by outsiders as quintessentially Canadian.
The large areas in the north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited forests.
To put the population in perspective, something that surprised many: There are more African Americans living in the US than there are total residents in Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island, and a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent countries, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, and it took hold in a big way in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Woman: It is recommended that any woman traveling should say that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It can also help to wear a ring (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in what they consider harassment, such as uncommon following, arm-grabbing, and others.
Be strong in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it won't be okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese and rebuilt under the name Casa Branca, only to be abandoned after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easier to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and the entire spectrum of trinkets, but all of this is for the tourists.
Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo is a tourist city located in the easternmost part, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the town's streets, especially the town center.
While Goma is still a safe place, any visits outside of Goma need to be checked to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city remains a base for ascending Mount Nyiragongo as well as some of the most affordable Mountain Gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Accompanied by the relative inaccessibility of it, "Timbuktu" became used as a metaphor for a far-off, exotic land.
Today, Timbuktu is a struggling city, although its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to threats from desert sands.
This is one of the featured stops during Henry Louis Gates' special Wonders of the African World on PBS.
The city is uniquely positioned compared to other cities in the country, as it has more Arabic influence than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and lies mostly within the border of Mozambique to the north, with the northern border being the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting a diverse range of wildlife.
This is a leading attraction in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, there is a daily conservation and entrance fee for the park.
It might still be beneficial for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to any selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the area regarded by tourists as the main focus.
The parade of buildings that makes up Hong Kong's skyline is likened to a vibrant bar chart seen through the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront across the harbor.
The major development of Hong Kong Island province is concentrated along the reclaimed land on the northern coast.
This is the place that British colonizers took as their own and if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans is declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the territory of India is called Sundarbans National Park.
Even so, the forests are not just mangroves—they include some of the last remaining stands of the vast forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is covered by water/wetland area.

Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because inter-district buses are usually full, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, with a length of 378 meters and two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the customs checkpoints of Brazil are expected to be completed.
The Guarani are the most important group of indigenous people living in Eastern Paraguay today, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who are also skilled in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish started the era of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has continuously preserved many of its indigenous customs and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the most skilled polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year took place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can still be found here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP) at a rate of one to one.
You can exchange the money at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere in the islands and within Stanley, credit cards and United States dollars are also generally accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, even though British and United States currency might be; check with owners in advance to understand what payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving.
Because Montevideo is in the Southern Hemisphere, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, it is common for temperatures to rise above +30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particular "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Even though many animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears or wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how tame they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Additionally, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking odorous foods and maintain a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of at least 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and became the official capital of Samoa in 1959.
The port was the site of a famous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in town resulted in the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland straddling two harbors. The most well-known are in three locations.
North Shore beach (in the North Harbour district) is located in the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches that are safe for swimming and have plenty of shade from the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, above the market towns of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
This is often a beach frequented by families with many shops lining the shore. It is safe to swim here.
The leading local beer is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
Many French wines are available to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A short black is an 'espresso', a cappuccino is full of cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is based on Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but very delicious.
Many trips to the reefs are made throughout the year, and damage from any cause to the reef is rare.
Even so, still seek advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay attention to safety reminders.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They are sometimes seen outside of these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater Crocodiles are not actively inhabiting the ocean, their primary habitat is in the river estuaries north from Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind knowing they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with particular hotels, although you might find it possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can still hold the reservation for you if you need more time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
Any changes or requests must first go through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, most attendees at music festivals decide to camp on site, and most attendees consider this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to get there early to get a camping site close to the music.
Please note that even after the main parts of the festival conclude, music may continue to be played in some areas until midnight.
Some festivals have a special camping area for families with young children.
When crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, be mindful of the cabin location, because passing through ice will cause terrible noise for those most affected.
Included in Saint Petersburg excursions is time in the city. Cruise passengers are free from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos often go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by their guests. They usually have no windows or clocks, and restrooms are hard to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and keep them in the place.
Some places offer intoxicating drinks at home. Likewise, intoxication impairs judgment, and every good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or across mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is low friction and you cannot drive as if you were on asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow to trap you can fall in a short amount of time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, freezing conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues with almost no disruption throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist draw in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to a trip to observe the fascinating wildlife of Africa, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach vehicles, and standard equipment will allow for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or going "footing") consists of hiking, which can be done for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some of the events will be held in various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies did not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, even if one isn't present in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one.
Be careful not to let the cloth get too hot (which could cause burning, or in severe cases, fire).
There are various methods for purifying water, some of which are more effective against particular threats.
In some places, running the water for one minute is enough, while in others, several minutes are needed.
The effects of filters vary, and if you have concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unfamiliar to their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in more severe cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or cause infections.
Communicable diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods without tax and excise in certain designated locations.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which mostly passes through isolated backwoods terrain.
If you are not used to driving on roads in the country, keep your skills about you: There remain steep grades, narrow roads, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits tend to be noticeably lower than preceding and following sections -- often 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) -- and strict adherence to them is more important than anything else.
However, surprisingly, the mobile phone service is stronger here compared to many other remote routes, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite delicious, and in Bavaria, they are quite abundant and varied, similar to their neighbors to the south, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples cooked in pastries throughout the year, and cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many German baked goods also offer almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but delicious pastry, try what is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on vegetables and spices, with or without meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "saucy" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the northern regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a broad term that covers the many different regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without additional qualifications, the term likely means that the food originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Widely used throughout the archipelago today, Javanese cuisine features simple, seasoned dishes, with early flavorings known to the Javanese being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various fragrant spices.
The stirrups are what support the feet of a rider who is seated below or on the side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider but can raise safety concerns due to the potential for the rider's feet to get trapped.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but one foot remains caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs away. To lessen this risk, many safety precautions should be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, relatively short heel.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that provide a way for a leather stirrup to come off the saddle if pulled back by a fallen rider.
The Cochamó Valley - the premier climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, featuring diverse granite big walls and cliffs.
The summits feature breathtaking views from above. Climbers from all over the world continue to create new routes amidst the endless potential of walls.
Downhill snowsports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered ground with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is one of the leading travel activities, with many people becoming enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old -- cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking via skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
This is related, but generally does not involve alpine style ski touring or mountaineering; the latter is done on steeper terrain and requires more rigid skis and boots.
Think of a ski route as being like a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover much greater distances than walking -- but you rarely get the speed of cross country skiing without a heavy backpack on good roads.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many countries would mean going through many visa applications and passport controls many times.
The Schengen zone, however, functions as if it were a single country.
As long as you reside in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you no longer need to apply for a visa separately in each of the member countries of Schengen, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of how old an item must be to be considered antique. Some tax agencies specify items older than 100 years as antiques.
Explanations have geographical variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places such as North America compared to Europe.
Handicraft products are designated as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding it is also important for many with other professions.
Although traditionally, not all Sámi are involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but live from fishing, hunting and the like, owning reindeer is often for working animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern industries. Tourism is an important livelihood in Sápmi, the land of the Sámi.
Even though it is widely used, especially by non-Romani people, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you are visiting is under a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can still request to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own citizens.
As an example, American residents in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Announcements are just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are usually brief, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the overarching term for any dangerous weather event with the potential to cause damage, serious disruption to people's lives, or loss of human life.
Severe weather events can occur in any part of the world, and they come in various forms that may depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, and precipitation, and typhoons.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any potential weather hazards that may affect their area, as these could impact any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that may be considered a war zone should obtain professional training.
Searching the Internet for 'Hostile environment course' might provide the address of a local company.
A course typically covers all the issues discussed in more detail, often with practical experience.
A typical course usually lasts for 2-5 days and includes role play, extensive first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that discuss survival in the wilderness are common, but there are few publications that discuss war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery in another country must ensure they have valid travel documents for their return.
Government authorization to issue passports that do not specify gender (X) or updated documents to reflect preferred names and genders varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is increasingly changing.
Security screenings at checkpoints became more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to go through scanners without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
A rip current is the return flow from waves breaking on the shore, usually near a reef or similar structure.
Due to the underwater topography, the return current is mostly confined to certain deep areas, and a strong current towards deep water can develop there.
Many deaths occur as a result of exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current, which can become impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back won't be much harder than normal.
Try to head to a place where you won't be caught again or, depending on your ability and if you've been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
Sudden re-entry can be more jarring than cultural shock (resulting in a shorter honeymoon period), longer, and potentially more severe.
Travelers who quickly adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
Upon your return after living in another country, you are already influenced by the new culture, and you have lost some of the customs from your native culture.
When you first went to another country, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are still needed for travelers to return home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most fascinating things in the place for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can view them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you can always hear the voices of the tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx was placed as a backdrop and the storyteller told a long story.
The scenarios in the pyramids are being shown and the different pyramids are being valued.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the highest concentration of bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest is King George Island, which is where Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Some include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides an excellent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is located in the southern region of the Peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of this Peninsula merge into plains, and then rise again to form the 360 km long linear Ellsworth Mountains, which are divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range is the highest mountain range in Antarctica, and the Vinson Massif with a height of 4892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote areas with no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone is your only option.
A satellite phone is usually more expensive than a mobile phone, because you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is typically used on ships, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions with remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting this service.
A growingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is popular, especially among those who drop out of school, allowing them to have a year off before going to university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap-year course in another country can actually improve your chances of transferring to higher education when you return to your home country.
Usually, there is a tuition fee to enroll in these kinds of educational programs.
Finland is a good destination for sailing. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and on the coast of the archipelago.
Among the islands and lakes, you don't need a yacht.
Even the beaches of the islands and the largest lake that can accommodate even yachts, small boats or kayaks offer a different experience.
Sauna bathing is a national pastime in Finland, with one sauna for every seven or eight people.
This is supported by Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it's not significantly different (e.g., in the Netherlands the number is one in forty).
Most distinctive Baltic Cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit a historic city for several full days while returning and sleeping on the ship each night.
If you only visit the beach using cruise ship excursions, you will no longer need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be daunting for some people of all ages and backgrounds, especially those who have never traveled before or those who have experienced frightening incidents.
This is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and aversions to other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight helps to overcome fear based on ignorance or a feeling of lack of control.
Courier companies are paid well for the fast delivery of goods. Often, time is very important for business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On other routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there is a problem.
If they are shipping by air, on some routes it may take several days to clear unloading and customs.
The only way to get it through quickly is to send it as checked luggage. Airline regulations do not allow sending cargo without a passenger, which is where your entry comes in.
The clearest way to fly first or business class is to shell out a hefty wad of cash to get the privilege (or even better, have your company do it for you).
Even so, it isn't cheap: in principle, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in looking for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of travelers who are willing to pay dollars for the privilege of getting anywhere fast and comfortably, and they charge them accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. Romanian is the local language, but Russian is more commonly used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffered from tribal conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistria Republic in the eastern part of Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic connections have been re-established between the two parts of Moldova despite the setbacks in political negotiations.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with a population reaching 3.7 million, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a major transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial center, situated around a large gulf and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glass-fronted structures and modern shopping centers are juxtaposed with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches, giving the city an atmosphere that feels more Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has a unique octagonal church.

Please remember that what you are visiting is a gravesite of many who died, and also a place of almost immeasurable significance to a large portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who died or worked until their death there, like Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this place with the full dignity, solemnity, and respect that it deserves. Do not intrude with matters concerning the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the area, such as by marking or writing graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are written only in Catalan because this is mandated by law as the primary official language.
Even so, many still used Spanish in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the Metro are only made in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by the automated system in several languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being arrogant, rude, and haughty.
While most of this is an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is still to practice good manners, acting as someone "bien élevé" (well-raised). This will make it easier to make friends.
The Parisians' abrupt manners quickly disappear if you show initial courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is a heavily forested area, consisting mostly of beech, spruce, and fir trees, and showcasing a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It is remarkable that it has a wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, diverse soils, and varying levels of elevation.
The area is still inhabited by a very wide variety of animals and birds.
Only rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be found there, along with many more common species.
While visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide coverings for women who are unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially in a bright color, you'll get a smile from the monks or nuns at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover their knees.
You can also borrow these at the entrance, but they are not washed after each use, so you might not be comfortable wearing these skirts. It's only one size that fits all men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of other Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple yet popular meal, especially during summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available toppings such as cheese, tuna, and others.
All nouns, including the word "Sie" for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and nouns.
It also makes reading easier, even if writing seems complicated because you need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a sentence construction.
Pronunciation is generally easy in the Italian language because most words are pronounced as they are written.
The first letters to watch out for are c and g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.

Pre-modern observatories are generally no longer in use today and have remained only as museums or educational sites.
While light pollution wasn't as much of a problem during their heyday as it is now, and they were mostly found in cities or on campuses, they were more easily accessible than their modern counterparts.
Most modern research telescopes are large facilities located in remote places with good atmospheric conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the chosen flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were started by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants are best appreciated in their natural environment, so resist the urge to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit formal gardens, taking "specimens" will get you kicked out, no questions asked.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to visit and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after you pop over there.
But being in the "high tropics," just a few degrees above the equator, requires you to face both the heat (constantly) and the intense sunlight (when the sky is clear, but that's rare).
There are still some buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure the bus you're thinking of taking goes to Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba nearby.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-Christians in Christian countries and non-Christians worldwide.
There's a tradition of staying awake outdoors the night before Easter to witness the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it might also be related to pre-Christian Spring and Fertility rituals.
Many traditional churches typically celebrate the Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with congregations often proceeding directly to the celebration at the stroke of midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally appeared on the island arrived here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the remote distance from the continent, mammals were unable to travel there, allowing the giant tortoise to become the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals were introduced including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during winter, you will experience the polar night, where the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Aurora borealis, because the sky is dark for almost all hours.
Because the areas are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution isn't usually a problem, you can still enjoy the stars.
The work culture of the Japanese is more organized and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are the standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Workplace harmony is very important, emphasizing the team's efforts over individual achievements.
