USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter and recognizes the strong need of the Olympic family to foster a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by continuing to move forward with meaningful changes in the organization, rather than decertification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the creature's fur was chestnut-brown on top with a light orange-colored underside.
The finding also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but did have other feather features – barbs and barbules – the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The researchers suggest that the feathers' structure indicates they weren't used for flying, but rather for regulating warmth or for display. The researchers suggest that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of an adult and not of a fledgling.
The researchers suggested that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not a chick's feathers.
A car bomb detonated near the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and wounding more than twenty other people.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The result the team was looking for would have been caused by tidal forces between the galaxies' dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon has gravitational pull, which brings large waves, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the ninth astrological sign (Sagittarius) galaxy.
The researchers were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
The theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is found around a galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made of many small particles.

Doctor Tony Moll discovered the extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant is "very seriously not okay and alarming due to the very high fatality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the bug in the hospital, thinks Dr. Moll, and at least two were hospital healthcare workers.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put a pre-printed piece of paper showing the candidate they want to elect into an envelope.
After officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law strictly regulates the proceedings.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the voting and that no envelopes are added except those from the properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Four skiers in the women's seed group failed to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the giant slalom failed to qualify for the chase.
The Madhya Pradesh police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya says, "We have arrested five people who harassed the Swiss woman, and we have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampra Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Salanki said that the defendants appeared in court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The street where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while rescue agencies freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized in James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred again to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekayo has since been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, but any firsthand evidence is possibly tainted because her image has been widely publicized.
This is a known practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law works differently, and courts have viewed the publication of images as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish images, etc., of suspects.
The Crown Office, which is ultimately responsible for prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that further comments should not be made at least until indictment.
The document, according to reports, will discuss the border dispute that Palestine wants to base on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics covered were reported to include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both peoples, and the Jordan Valley problem.
The State of Israel demands an ongoing military presence in the valley for ten years from when the agreement is signed, whereas the PA is only willing to allow such a presence for five years.
Hunters in the supplemental pest control trial will have been closely watched by rangers, as the trial was followed and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received complete safety and training instruction.
Martelly swore in a new temporary electoral council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
This is Mortelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the previous CEO's dismissal as part of a package of measures to bring the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's answer to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The often-violent protests were driven by a failure to hold elections, some already scheduled from 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with mild burns.
Japan's Ministry of Finance, Trade and Industry (METI) said there was concern about 27 accidents related to the plans.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 more incidents of overheating, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry responded to Apple's rejection of the report by calling it truly "regrettable."
The earthquake shook Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said that there were no damages reported to the public.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that there was no evidence of any tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was later shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in the medical field.
He was trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
During the time that he worked in the hospital, Liggins began researching premature labor in his spare time.
His research shows that if a hormone had been administered, it would have accelerated the child's fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Lana was the first queen of ECW. My first supervisor. Lana died on the night of the two moons. Completely unique just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as we were... maybe even more... love her and I will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed for the 2010 general election, those who support Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard maintained throughout the campaign of the 2010 federal elections that she believes Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the members in the poll are in agreement, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in the three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his health condition has become a doubt.
He couldn't take the necessary drugs to overcome his pain because they are banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was reported on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of sending water to the Earth, along with organic matter which can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets crashed into the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill last month that legalized same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and foolishness".
He is considered to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to accurately pinpoint aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
There will be no extra transport laid on, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available at the venue.
Fear of transportation shortages has raised the possibility that the game will have to be played behind closed doors without any of the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new type of creature was created in just two generations, even though it is accepted that the process took much longer, due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of forms, it can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can be bent and braided. It can be hammered and twisted into sheets.
It can be made very thin and inserted into other metals. It can be made so thin that it was once used to cover the hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
That is called a chemical's pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH scale indicates the amount of hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been stripped away from them (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix together the two dry powders and then, with clean wet hands, squeeze it together into a ball.
The moisture on your hand will react with the outer layers, which will feel different and form a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every dwelling, connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remains of drainage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilizations, toilets were often part of an open bathhouse where men and women were together in a mixed society.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in the spheres receives the call and then reflects it back down, almost to the minute.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Researchers use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet tall to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in extraordinary ways. The greatest thing that the wheel has done for us is given us much easier and faster transportation.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Under them are more middle-sized cats that eat average prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral pet cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the idea of the niche, a special job that each cat possesses that keeps it from fighting with others.
Lions are the most social cats, who live in large groups and are called prides.
Troops are made up of one to three related adult males, along with as many as thirty females and young children.
The women are usually closely connected to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave quite similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and are also very fatally attached to their victims.
A good athlete from all sides, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, jump across great distances, and drag with five times as much power as a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar isn't like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a burst of snarling, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals that ocelots catch are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists think that sloths go out and find animals to eat (devour) by smell, smelling for where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well at night with night vision, and also move very stealthily. Ocelots catch their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they come (as if they move across mountains or water, or if they migrate to a new island and they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
The new environment has different resources and different competition, so the new population will need different tools and different changes to be a strong competitor than what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to acclimate to their new presence, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can't call themselves the same species.
We call the process speciation, which means only the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that people breathe in, and they take in carbon dioxide that people breathe out. (That means, breathe out).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also create shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat are plants. Without plants, animals could not exist.
The mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long mouth was lined with more than 70 knife-sharp teeth, along with an extra set on the roof of the mouth, meaning it was impossible for anything that crossed its path to escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may possibly have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. Rex was no match for it.
Although most of their food would have been familiar to us, the Romans did have some interesting or unfamiliar foods, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of creature called dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the women ate their food while sitting on benches, the rich people liked to have banquets together where they could lounge/recline on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient meals could not have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their idols, which was considered the dwelling of the god.
People brought sacrifices to idols, and the priests tried to serve the needs of the idols through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple has an open temple courtyard and then an inner space where only the priests can enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climates of the Middle East, the house was not as important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family happened openly under the sky.
Women were cooking in the courtyard; businesses were now open with tables looking out onto the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, therefore wood was terribly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse legends say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland because of murders, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
Even though every country was "Scandinavia," there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie National Treasure, it's possible that you think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even though there is something written on the underside of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." These words appear at the bottom of the document, inverted.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that initially the large format document (measuring 29 ¾ inches by 24 ½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
If so, it is likely that the note was added simply as a label.
The D-Day invasion and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was controlled by the Vichy French, who were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked southern France, the attack was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and then advanced towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together/cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," meaning human, connected to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and that also reflects the greatness of the community.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. A civilized culture means transferring knowledge through dozens of generations, cultural footprints that persist, and equal dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
Throughout the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government—with Congress being the sole component—under the Articles of Confederation.

It also did not have the authority to override tax laws and tariffs between countries.
The articles demanded unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states so underestimated the central government that their contributions were often absent.
Italy's national soccer team, together with Germany's national soccer team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are mostly popular in the northern region, with Italians competing in international games in Olympic events.
Japan holds close to 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to its cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often called, from a geographical standpoint, an "archipelago."
Taiwan's history begins back in the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In the year 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in indigenous grain production practices, and providing work for Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces seized control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan to be a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it relinquished control over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings along the edges of the complex have been rebuilt in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was returned and the return continues to this day.
For example, the most well-known still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but much more important than that is that the aspect ratios were inherited by the digital camera image censorship formats.
The 35mm format is exactly, a little confusingly, 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of the display (divide by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or are very closely approximated to this aspect ratio.
The heavily overused and often-mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that livens up what it maintains, namely a semblance of order in a picture.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds in both length and width (see example).
Throughout the epoch in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under critical observation.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound European states together despite the differences in language and customs.
His penetrating power affected everyone from the king to the simple citizen.
One of the Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are specifically for that purpose.
The church's central authorization had already been in Rome for over a thousand years, and its concentration of power from money has led to many questions about whether this belief has become fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
The strategy has proven to be effective, cutting off important military and civilian installations, although the blockade was against accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
England has mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the sea, causing danger even to neutral ships.
Because there was limited reaction to the tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
The prevailing sentiments of most citizens and peoples throughout the 1920s were of pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and cruelties of war during the First World War, nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job at the Edison company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a songbook, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each phase of China or each family that was in power was a unique dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty, there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, lasting for 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
Throughout the epochs, fierce wars have occurred between many nobles who fought for the chair (or seat of power).
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit in the highest place in the rich palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political consequences, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to humanity and not just one leader.
Even after the revolution, positions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, because instead of army ranks being based on class, they are now based on caliber/knowledge.
The French Revolution also influenced many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters outside of his general life. He often used to go to a cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (Light) to contemplate.
He himself, having lived through those times, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual cravings.
Positioned high on one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even though someone knows it exists. Once it's in the hole, it's a total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except for the clear, magnificent sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of the world can be seen or heard from inside this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the many pyramid structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was made for the honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to give honor to Khufu's wives and family members.
The "caret" symbol looks like a V, and the "circumflex" symbol looks like a staple or like a box missing its bottom side.
Up means you should start at the end and push the stick, and down means you should start at the frog (that's where your hand grips the stick) and pull the stick.
An up-bow usually produces a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more defined.
Feel free to add your own markings, but remember that the printed bending marks are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, on the 6th of October, 1789 were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
In a wagon, they rode back to Paris, surrounded by hooligans who shouted and clamored threats against the king and queen.
The masses of people forced the king and queen to have their carriage windows wide open.
Somewhere, a member of the mob had smashed the head of a royal guard who was murdered at Versailles in front of the trembling queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism in the occupation of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to offset a large part of the costs and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by the Wall Street banking houses.
Certainly, the large profits obtained from the long exploitation of the Philippine population would constitute the main profit of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one needs to understand the context that led to the development of the order.
The period when these gatherings took place is often referred to as the High Middle Ages, a time in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages come after the Early Middle Ages and before the Late Middle Ages, which generally ends around 1500.
Technological willingness is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas and implementations, from technological push or the technological imperative to a strict belief that human destiny is governed by an internal logic connected to scientific laws and their development in technology.
Most translations of technological terms share the same two general ideas: that development itself follows a course mainly outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, "affects" societies which are hereditary, and not subject to social conditions.
For example, someone can say that the motor car automatically leads to the development of highways.
However, a nationally broad road network is not economically feasible for only a handful of cars, therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
A high number of car owners also leads to a higher occurrence of accidents on the highways, which in turn leads to the creation of new technologies in the medical field for healing injured bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determination, drawn out by writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography melded individuals together, and over time, customs and culture connected to that geography arose, and these, being at peace with the place of society, were better than unintelligent, fixed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known to be the capital of fashion for the modern world, Constantinople was known as the capital of fashion in ancient Europe.
It is known for being a center for luxury beginning around 400 A.D. and lasting until about 1100 A.D.
Its status diminished throughout the twelfth century, mostly attributed to the fact that Crusaders returned, bringing with them gifts like silk and spices, which were more than the Byzantine market offered for them.
It was the time when the transfer of the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
Gothic style was at its highest peak in the period between the 10th-11th and the 14th centuries.
In the beginning, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the West can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of that time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to close clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using saved seeds native to the eco-region together with crop rotation or other very simple methods to get the most plantings.
Historically speaking, most farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case today in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together similar people who feel abandoned by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of their own identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that make a subculture unique can be language, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, regional, or a combination of these things.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a typical and emblematic use of fashion, which includes modes of dress, etiquette, and slang.
One of the most well-known methods used to illustrate the importance of society is to draw upon the several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, did not have social interaction with adults while growing up.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (mostly their own parents); in some cases, the child's abandonment was due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical limitations.
Some children may have experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma prior to being abandoned or running away.
Others are beaten for being raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, the feral child will exhibit behaviors (with physical limitations) almost entirely like those of that particular caregiving animal, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step too far.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are inside the software and are made to prompt, help with, and explain procedures that might be too difficult for the student to perform alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons that include neglect, abuse, and even abduction.
No child should have to grow up in a presence that doesn't nurture, doesn't show feeling, and doesn't provide education, but they do.
We look to the foster care system to be a protection zone for these children.
Our foster care system needs to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The internet brings together aspects of both mediums in interpersonal communication.
The tangible character of the internet leads to other aspects of the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing connection" were also identified as new motivations by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they researched viewer reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few seconds.
Separately, it is reported that someone can detect if a person is lying by assessing micro-expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper about the president's speech, showed how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can nevertheless accurately assess truthfulness.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic changes: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination shift back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy its amino acid requirements from plant resources that are available there.
Furthermore, failing to do so has serious consequences: increasing depression, malnutrition, and premature death.
The most accessible plant resource would be the protein accessible in leaves and legumes, but those are harder for primates like us to digest, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, food for animals (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides high amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their protein problem in roughly the same way that chimps on the savannah do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking oneself up during one's normal sleep period and falling asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done more easily by using a quieter alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without completely waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock in the middle of the night, it can be placed on the other side of the room, which forces you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking a lot of liquids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep, which forces one to get up to go to the bathroom.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses goes hand-in-hand with the inverse of the amount of tension that is in one's body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive life force there is. Every person has the possibility to find complete peace and tranquility.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of compassion and by many methods of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of unconditional love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is the deity yoga. Through the visualization of certain deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the enlightened consciousness is shaped.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and USA. With the end of the war, the contrasts in system, process, and culture led to the countries falling out.
Two years before the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and would have been resisted exactly, through proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defensive had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize again throughout the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, the plans were radically changed almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the northern regions of Poland, thereby violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is certainly the fastest way to move large quantities of goods across waters.
The job of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and things, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and things.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans tried to help transport men and materiel across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mostly U-boats, tried to stop the traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to defeat England as it had done with the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably the first animals domesticated, around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hide.
Domestic goats were usually kept in small groups that roamed over mountains and other overgrown areas, often tended to by goatherds. These goatherds were often children or young men, very similar to the more widely known shepherd. These herding methods are still in use today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although corduroy roads consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and haul larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads.
Crossties were known quite early for holding the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that it would be more effective to have a strip of iron on top.
This became commonplace behavior, but the iron wore out the wooden wheels on the wagons more.
Over time, wooden wheels took the place of iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails appeared.
The first known transportation was walking on foot; people started walking as early as two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (that means standing man).
Their predecessor, the australopithecus, usually did not walk completely upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start living more friendly towards the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists in order to reduce future suffering to a certain extent.
This is just like a symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we want something that isn't just a temporary solution, then we should find the underlying problems, and we should deactivate them.
It is clear enough that the world has changed a lot due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and problems have become greater due to overpopulation and humanity's exaggerated lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten sketch signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printing house of John Dunlap.
Throughout the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, today known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the garden of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which made it be read to his soldiers in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlop broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and live today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds, but which ones still look like a dinosaur?
They have feet with plus-feathers and nails, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind feet like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is coded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, like 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits – or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal obstruction may not always appear right away. Symptoms like vomiting are very general, and an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open box of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Consult the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The title "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for the group of insects.
The word comes from past familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects easily adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs are nidicolous, becoming accustomed to dwelling in the nest or living place of their host.
Throughout the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to raise a baby.
Families can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that the other couple can be parents to the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method essentially drives most scientific research.
However, experimentation alone is not enough; an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible accepted courses of action. Asking questions and making observations also accompany scientific research work.
Naturalists and philosophers looked at classical texts and, specifically, at the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinions were accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
Because knowledge of the Greek language had diminished, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek philosophers and scientific heritage.
Many accepted rhythms in physiology and behaviors are often critically dependent on whether endogenous cycles exist and their production by biological clocks.
Temporal rhythms, which are not simple responses to external temporal signals, have been documented for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to run for several free-running cycles even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the main proposals that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to introduce their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, labeling either the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with a radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can also have several other effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germline cells.
Only changes in germline cells can be passed on to children, while changes in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism appeals to people who are interested in visiting natural places for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activity include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in cars to go to their workplaces and pass by others whose workplaces are where they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that the massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
And in developed countries, one rarely hears similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems contain such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and cars between two points and the relationships they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic law is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Luckily, drivers behave in a logical, consistent order; thus, traffic flows tend to have some logical consistency and can be more or less mathematically determined.
To better represent traffic flow, connections were made between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
The relationships help with the planning, layout, and the operation of the rail facilities.
Insects were the first creatures to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them invade enemies more easily and find food and travel more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the length of their bodies.
That gives them a wider choice of small places to hide from persecutors.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
That seems understandable, since the world doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows out of the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although building pyramids in stone lasted until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their grandeur and the technical excellence of their construction.
New kingdoms in ancient Egypt marveled at their predecessors' monuments, which were already then quite over a thousand years old.
Vatican City's population is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the common language used by those who work in the state, whereas Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about key chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they can be discovered in nature in native form and are quite easy to unearth with simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
That was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include a small number of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the world is made of material, and all materials are made of tiny pieces called atoms.
Atoms are so wonderfully small that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of the sentence.
So, the lead became a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as newer methods of writing emerged, lead was relegated to a lower status and usage.
People now write messages on computer screens, never having come close to a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy wagon up a mountain. Splitting the nucleus again releases a bit of the energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they are prone to decay with little or no prompting.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outermost part of the moon is called the crust.
The layer is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the Maria and thicker over the Highlands.
There might be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on figuring out what makes people upset and what they like.
The theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have become ingrained as they developed into adulthood.
The theories look at what is certain about certain people that makes them want the things they do, and which things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers start managing their former peers. One end of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of supervisor has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, making evaluations, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything that the group has already done and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often results in divisions between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups are held to the same standards as conventional groups, but there are slight differences.
Virtual group members often function as the point of contact for their current physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional group members because their group can meet according to different time zones, which might not be understood by their local administration.
The presence of a real "virtual team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a characteristic part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of establishing a learning organization? One goal for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the active departments of an organization, wisdom can result.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome a stumbling block can lead to a new, advanced process to serve the needs of the buyers.
Before an organization can be progressive, the leadership must fabricate a culture of progressiveness, as well as share knowledge and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of attainment.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating capture. Therefore, it narrows the research area to make it much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for quite some time that various types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behaviors and bring about changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models which help us understand the processes of our brain.
Even though AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI represents a very important branch of computer science, which deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent work.
Features include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, which place an emphasis on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the world of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as built into several home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of every classroom. Quite often a teacher will like to take her students to places where one cannot travel by bus.
Technology offers the solution through virtual field trips. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire magnificent artwork while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share the experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina build a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the website is modeled anew, but old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and writing, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging compels students to become more familiar with the world around them. The need to cater to the audience's interests drives students to be clever and interesting/engaging (Tau-tau 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to take their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet material, students can clarify their position in relation to others' descriptions as well as publish their own perspectives on certain problems" (Aravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful, bilingual capital and has a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Deeper in the south are Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of the Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as officially considered Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated, and part of it is almost an uninhabited wilderness.
For a comparison of population that shocks many people: there are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadians.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean, close to the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is, by all accounts, the largest, and has its own unique world-style when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or affiliated with France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to those lands, and it was very well received in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north, and by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all women travelers say that they are married, regardless of their marital status.
It's helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can result in what they might consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand strong (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to have to abandon it later after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Baida, and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, clay-formed articles, leather goods, hookahs, and a large selection of spices, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the extreme east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets in the city, especially in the city center.
Even though Goma is quite secure, every visit outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the situation of the fighting that is happening in the northern Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano together with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The typical (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Together with its relative remoteness, "Timbuktu" is used as a simile for beautiful, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a dilapidated city, although its good name makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airfield.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the danger of desert sand.
It was one of the huge revelations throughout Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it has a stronger Arab look than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa and borders Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different forest animals.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa, and is considered to be the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It might also be useful for someone to buy a Wild Card, which provides entry to any selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists prioritize as their main focus.
The arrangement of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a dazzling stalagmite chart that becomes more prominent with the view of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land near the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonists took for themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest littoral mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps – they also include parts of the last remaining sections of the mighty jungles that once covered the entire Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered in water/marsh areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the sub-district bus station (opposite the river) throughout the day, but mostly, especially those going to Mazar and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing taxis with others is a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Phunaka (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lines of 3.50 meters wide.
The maximum height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction work finished in August 2011, but it didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge needs to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs inspection points are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most notable indigenous group that lived in what is today eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also subsisted on agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of primitive tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payaguá, who subsisted by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "the giant province of the Indians," was born as a result of a clash between Spanish forces and the local native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the era of colonization which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has striven to maintain much of its old-established character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Los Cañitas.
Small competitions and struggles can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, search Asociación Argentina de Polo (Argentine Polo Association).
The official Falkland Islands currency is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is estimated to be the same as one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, across from the FIC West supermarket.
British pounds are usually accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley, and credit cards and United States dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and American money may be; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, therefore exchange money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30º Celsius are normal.
The winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the wind and dampness together make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, the animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how gentle they look, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a suitable distance. The animals are big, wild, and can be dangerous, therefore, give them their space.
In addition to that, be watchful that smells attract bears and other wildlife, therefore avoid carrying or cooking fragrant food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on the island of Upolu and has a population of a little less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port is the site of the sadly famous Naval Battle of Apia in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
Throughout the independence war organized by the Maoist movement, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the killing of the chief Tafa'ē Tōmasi Lilōlōfī III.
There are many beaches due to Auckland's straddling of two harbors. The most popular are in the three regions.
The northern shores (in the North Harbor area) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Lange Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and mostly possess shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive's shores are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale parts of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
Often times, they are packed family beaches with a good span of businesses lining the shore. It is safe to swim.
The main local beer is "Number One," it's not a complicated beer, but a tasty and refreshing one. The other local beer is called "Monte."
There are many French wines available, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is an "espresso," cappuccino comes all the way to the top with cream (no foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but very good.
Many trips to the summit are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of the factors are rare.
You should still take instructions from authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish pass near shores and near river waterways from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes be found outside of those times.
Sharks do exist, but they barely attack people. Mostly, sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their main habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers the peace of mind that they will have somewhere to sleep once they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with certain hotels, although you will likely be able to book other types of accommodation, such as camping grounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually put together packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, and sometimes combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the proposal or to obtain other documents for your purpose (e.g., visa).
Any changes or requests should go through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For certain festivals, the majority of music festival attendees decide to sleep on-site, and most participants consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to go in early enough to get a camping site close to the music.
Remember that even though music on the main platforms has ended, it's possible that there are parts of the performance that will constantly play music until late in the middle of the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in the winter, check the cabin location, since passing through ice creates a terrible commotion for those who are most affected by it.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos usually strive to get the most out of the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and provided entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and keep them at the place.
Some places offer drinks on the house. But being drunk impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Someone who will be traveling to high latitudes or over mountains should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, traction is weak and you can't drive as you would on bare pavement.
During intense snowstorms, enough snow can accumulate to get you stuck, falling in very little time.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by rain or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari, in popular usage, refers to overland trips to see the magnificent African wild animals, mainly on the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, are prone to getting too close to cars, and standard equipment will allow for good visibility.
The lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy from time to time, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "walking safari", or walking "footing") involves walking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Several events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as the 1964 games were held there.
If you booked your flight and accommodations for 2020 before the lockdown was announced, then you possibly have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies were not extended to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most evening tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes helps to dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board ready for use on site, even if someone is not present in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't want to wear ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if you can get one.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to get too hot (as this can cause it to shrink, or in extreme cases, to burn).
There are other ways of purifying water; some are more effective against certain threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is enough, in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have a concern, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reliable company.
Travelers may encounter animals that they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Contagious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people through force, did not qualify as pets.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from tax at specific locations.
Travelers who go to countries with heavy taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often traversing isolated, underdeveloped terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you: sudden grades, narrow lanes, and sharp turns dominate there.
Posted maximum speeds are considerably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections – averaging 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Interestingly though, mobile phone service is much stronger here than in any other area, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their neighbors to the south, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with stewed apples in pastries year-round, and cherries and plums appearing throughout the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular pastries often go very well with a glass of strong coffee.
If you want to try small but rich pastries, try what is called, depending on the region, Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A kure is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
A measure can be either dry or wet, depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a general term covering a huge selection of regional cuisines that are found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualifiers, the title usually refers to the cuisine originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese food features a range of simply spiced dishes, the strongest flavors being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various fragrant spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They offer greater stability for the rider but can have safety problems due to the possibility of a rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but remains with one foot caught in the stirrup, then he can be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most passengers wear travel boots with a heel and a smooth, narrow sole.
Afterward, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup leather to fall off the saddle if it is dragged backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley – Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a selection of granite giant walls and crags.
Sharp peaks include breathtaking views of pointed mountains. Climbers from all parts of the world continue to forge new paths among the endless possibilities of walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include ice skating and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as ski bums, who plan entire vacations around skiing at a specific location.
Skiing is very old - cave paintings show skiers as far back as 5000 BC!
Downhill ice sliding is a sport that goes back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also called backcountry ski, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related but usually does not include alpine style ski tours or mountain climbing, the latter being carried out in extreme terrains and requiring much harder skis and boots.
Think of a skywalk as a similar walking path.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat larger and further distances than when walking on foot – but only in rare cases will you get the speed rate of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent countries. Going through many countries under normal circumstances would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
The Schengen Zone, however, works a bit like one country in that regard.
As long as you stay within the zone, you can usually cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for visas to each of the Schengen member states separately, thereby saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no accepted definition for which manufactured items are antiques. Several tax agencies call merchandise older than one hundred years antique.
The opinion has geographic variations, where the vintage restrictions can be shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be defined as antiques, even if they are younger than similar machine-made goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture surrounding the trade is also significant for many other fields.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami were involved in large reindeer husbandry, but lived off fishing, trapping, and the like, having reindeer merely as draft animals.
Today people work in Sami in modern jobs. Tourism is an important source of income in Sami, the Sami region.
Although it is widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "Gypsy" is often considered derogatory due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate portrayals of Roma people.
If the country you want to visit becomes the subject of a travel advisory, your health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You might also want to inquire about proposals from governments other than your own, but their proposal is designed for their citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East may have to deal with different circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisories are simply a brief overview of the political situation in a country.
The perspectives presented are often short, superficial, and simple compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather event with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive snow, and forest fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of all the risks of severe weather that will affect their area, as this could possibly affect travel plans.
Someone who plans a visit to a country that may be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A search on the internet for "hostile environment course" will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will typically be from 2-5 days and will include role-playing, a lot of first aid, and a few times weapons training.
Books and magazines that deal with existence in the wild are well-known, but publications that deal with war zones are rare.
Travelers planning sex reassignment surgery must ensure they carry valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without specifying gender (X), or documents remade to accommodate desired name and gender changes.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize the documents is just as variable.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not have to worry about going through the scanners with their privacy and dignity untouched.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves that crash into the seashore/beach, often near the shore or similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the backflow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a rapid wave to deep water may possibly form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you come out of the water, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to flee somewhere where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your experience and whether you were noticed, you might want to wait for a rescue.
Reverse culture shock comes on faster than culture shock (there's less of a honeymoon phase), it lasts longer, and it can be more serious.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you are already accustomed to the new culture and you have lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first arrived abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
People might not expect that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers who are returning home.
The Pyramid Sound and Light Show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see it in silence before the show begins.
Usually, you always hear the hustle and bustle of tourists and vendors. The story of noise and lights is just like in a storybook.
The Sphinx is seated as the foundation and the teller of a long tale.
The scenes are set on the pyramids, and the other pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a wonderful natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of this peninsula converge in the plateau, then they rise again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 meters with Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone is your only option.
A satellite phone usually doesn't take the place of a mobile phone, since you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is very often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
A very popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially known with school leavers, it allows them to take a year off before university, without taking away from their education.
A gap year course abroad can greatly improve one's chances of getting into higher education back in their home country.
Usually there will be a tuition cost to enroll in the learning programs.
Finland is a strong shipping destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and rivers.
Although the rugged archipelago and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller ships or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is the same as in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands it's numbers one to forty).
Most of the notable Baltic cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for a few full days and return to sleep on a ship at night.
If you are going ashore only with a ship excursion, you will not need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
Some cruises present Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had other trauma.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and dislikes of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on not being in control.
Companies that specialize in sending packages are well-paid for sending things quickly. Often, time is very important with business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an important repair.
For some routes, the larger companies had their own airplanes, but for other routes and smaller companies, it was a problem.
If they sent things via air freight, certain routes would have taken days to unload and clear customs.
The only way it will go through faster is to send it as checked baggage. Airport regulations won't allow them to send it as baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The understandable way to fly in first or business class is to spend a fat sum of money for the privilege (or even better, have your company do it for you).
However, it doesn't come out cheap; as a rule, you can expect to pay more than four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times more for first class.
Generally speaking, there's no point in even looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there's a certain main group of travelers who are willing to pay the highest price for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they price accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic strife.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of a self-declared Transnistrian republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been renewed between the two parts of Moldova despite its failure in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christian.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Once the old city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial center, built around a huge sea and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers exist together with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more like Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighboring island of Eysturoy and has an interesting octagonal church.
In the churchyard are interesting marble sculptures of doves above various graves.
It's worth giving half an hour to stroll around in the fascinating village.
To the north and easy to reach is the romantic and interesting city of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after a glowing account of its beauty recorded by Lord Byron.
Skatorb bus 403 regularly travels to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also worth visiting in the north is the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Shrine), a place of worldwide famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are actually visiting a mass burial site, as well as a place that has almost an incalculable significance to a considerable portion of the world's population.
There are many men and women who still live and have lived through their time here, and many others who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this place with all the honor, seriousness, and respect that it deserves. Don't make any jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti into the structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are marked only in Catalan because it is established by law to be the first and official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the subway are made only in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced through an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be egocentric, impolite, and conceited.
Even though this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to behave in Paris is to be on your best behavior, acting like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will significantly ease getting around.
Parisian sharpness outside will quickly pass if you prove a few key refinements.
The Plitvice National Park is heavily vegetated, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean plants.
It has a particularly broad selection of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different types of soil, and many different levels of elevation.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare wild creatures such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be found there, along with many more familiar kinds of creatures.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and also have the shoulders covered.
Most of the monasteries provide coverings for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Additionally, men are required to wear pants that cover the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the many items at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing the robes. One size fits all for the men!
Majorcan cuisine, like similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple, popular supper, especially in the summer, is the "pa amb oli": bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available additions such as cheese, tuna fish, etc.
All nouns, including the word "you" (si) for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to be able to distinguish between a few verbs and objects.
It also seemingly makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat more complicated, having the need to figure out when and if a verb or adjective is used on a substantiated basis.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in the Italian language because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to look at are C and G, because their sound depends on the following vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce R and RR differently: cara means dear, while carro means cart.
Persian has a moderately easy and mostly smooth grammar.
Therefore, reading the spelling notebook will help you learn a lot about Persian spelling and understand phrases better.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish will often jump to the conclusion too quickly that Portuguese is close enough that it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually not found/obsolete in modern times, and remain as museums, or places of education/education.
Since light pollution in their heyday wasn't as much of a problem as it is today, they were usually found in cities or near campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes for research are huge structures in remote areas with satisfactory atmospheric conditions.
Observing cherry blossoms, also known as Hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the chosen flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the royal court.
Plants look their best when in a natural environment, therefore resist the temptation to remove even a single specimen.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, then collecting "specimens" will also expose you to being thrown out, without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to be and easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after arriving.
However, being located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also a few buses going north to Hebron, to the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are thinking of taking goes into Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good subject around which to base a holiday.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to interesting places on the Danube, or sail the length of the Erie Canal.
They also note routes for well-known walking and biking paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christian ones around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake at an open point to see the sunrise.
There are certainly Christian theological explanations for the tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night throughout Easter weekend, with congregations often breaking into the celebration right at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came there by swimming, flying, or being carried on the water/floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals cannot make the journey, making the giant tortoises the main grazing animals in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of mankind to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in the winter, you will have the experience of the polar nights, meaning the sun will not shine above the horizon.
This gives a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, since the sky will be dark more or less around that time.
Since the area has a small population, and light pollution is therefore not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what people from the West may be used to.
Blazers are common business attire, and colleagues address each other by last names or by job titles.
Workplace collaboration is critical, emphasizing teamwork rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to get their supervisors' approval for every decision they make and are expected to follow their supervisors' instructions without question.
