Ring also reached a settlement in a lawsuit against its competitor in security services, ADT Corporation.
Although an experimental vaccine appears to reduce the death rate from Ebola, no treatment has so far clearly proven to be suitable for treating an existing infection.
Initially, a compound called ZMapp offered hope in the region; however, formal trials showed it had fewer benefits than expected in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning that researchers used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the US Olympic Committee and approves the unconditional need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by proceeding with significant changes within our organization, rather than denying certification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already common, but also provides details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Researchers say that this animal's plumage was dark red on top, with a paler or reddish underside.
The discovery also provides insight into how the evolutionary process of bird feathers has been.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but do have other characteristics of feathers—barbs and barbules—the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development compared to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the host shows an adult plumage and not down feathers of a young one.
The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the host exhibits adult plumage and not down feathers of a juvenile.

The work that was done was mostly theoretical, but the program was made to simulate observations of the Sagittarius constellation.
The result that the team was looking for would come from the gravity between the dark matter in the galactic halo and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Earth is drawn by the Moon, which creates high and low tide, so too does the Milky Way Galaxy draw the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy.
The scientists managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a kind of halo around the galaxy, and is made up of many small particles.

Doctor Tony Moll noticed the extremely drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new strain was "very confusing and frightening, due to the very high mortality rates."
Some patients may have contracted the bacteria in the hospital, according to Dr. Moll, and at least two were nurses.
In one year, one infected person could potentially infect 10 to 15 people in their immediate surroundings.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB within the entire group of people with tuberculosis still appears low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people who are infected at any given moment in South Africa.

"Their thermal properties aren't as regular as those of larger caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly stable temperature, but they are typical for deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has usually been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put a pre-printed paper slip, showing which candidate they choose, into an envelope.
After officials verify their identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.
French electoral law regulates the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are present from the beginning of the vote, and that no envelopes other than those of voters who are properly approved are inserted.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the procedure. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, according to a precise procedure.

Her first event was slalom, where she was eliminated from the competition on her first run. 36 of the 116 athletes had the same result in that competition.
In the other competition, giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's сидячий (sitandi) group with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the Austrian Claudia Loesch in first place and 1:09.02 minutes behind Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary in ninth place.
Four sit-ski athletes in the women's category did not complete their first runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in total in the giant slalom failed to make the leaderboard.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the laptop and mobile phone.
D K Arya, Deputy Superintendent of Police, said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces hidden.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterwards, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with killing her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but the evidence from eyewitnesses is potentially tainted because pictures of her have been widely publicised.
This is a common practice elsewhere in Great Britain, but Scottish courts operate differently, and the courts have considered that publicised images could be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "journalists seem to be pushing the boundaries when they publicize photos, etc., of people under suspicion."
The Ministry of Justice, which has overall supervision of prosecutions, has informed journalists that no further comments will be made, at least until the indictment has been filed.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the disagreement over the borders that Palestine wants, based on the borders before the Six-Day War in 1967.
It is said that other topics include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that the military presence in the valley continues for ten years after an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to allow such a presence for five years.
Forest rangers had close supervision of the shooters in the extra pest control experiment, because there was monitoring of the experiment, and its effectiveness was assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, skilled volunteers were provided under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, the current leader for conservation of protected areas and public property at NPWS, the four shooters who were selected for the first shooting event received extensive training in safety and practice.
Martelly was sworn in before a new provisional electoral council (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended that the former Election Commission step down, as part of an overall effort to move the country towards new elections.
The council was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the government, which began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some since 2011.
Approximately 60 incidents of iPods with a hardware fault, which overheat, have been reported, they have caused six fires and given four people burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of the 27 accidents related to the units.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious."
The Ministry of Culture responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands' Crisis Management Office said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released early, in addition to the Filipino media personnel.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed a toilet. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and went to work at the National Women’s Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reports that investigators from the government recovered two 'black box' recorders on Wednesday.
The lifeguards also gave Luna recognition.
Tommy Dreamer said, “Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first enforcer. Luna died the night of the two moons. Quite singular, just like her. Strong woman.”
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as strange as me... maybe even more so... I'm fond of her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place."
Out of 1,400 people surveyed before the federal election in 2010, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The acting emergency prime minister Julia Gillard asserted during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should be a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign is over.
34 percent of those surveyed also hold the view that they wish Queen Elizabeth II will be the last monarch of Australia.
Within the scope of the study, 29 percent of respondents believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle and in three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, there are doubts about his confidence.
He has not been able to take his medication, which he needs to manage the pain, because he is not allowed to participate in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people have confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the Earth, as well as organic matter that can produce proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets take shape, especially how Earth took shape after comets merged with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month allowing same-sex marriage.
He described the talk as "political twaddle and foolishness".
It is believed that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA expects will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses technology based on transponders, as opposed to older technology based on ground-based radar, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transportation will be put in place, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available at the venue.
Concerns about a lack of transport created the possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without supporters from the team.
A study, which was made public on Thursday in the journal Science, reported the evolution of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden announced that the new species had developed through just two generations, although it was believed that the process took much longer, from interbreeding between a local Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the imported cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into all sorts of forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into thin thread, which can be wound and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and be applied to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted illustrations in books, called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a substance. You can make a measuring tool by using red cabbage juice.
Red cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the substance is.
The amount of acidity (pH) is reflected in relation to the amount of hydrogen ions (H for hydrogen in pH) in the substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms are composed of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two types of dry powder together and then squeeze them with clean, wet hands into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will interact with the outer layers, which will feel funny and create a kind of scale.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets that could flush, in almost every house, connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remnants of heating systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a messenger.
The messenger in space receives the call and then throws it back down, almost in the same instant.
The satellite was sent into space in a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the atmosphere above the Earth distorts some of our light and view.
It takes giant rockets taller than 100 feet to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us much easier and faster transport.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other transportation tools.
Below them are mid-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat a much more abundant prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret behind their good results is the concept of the niche, a specific task each cat has that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cat species and live in large groups called prides.
Herds consist of one to three adult males, which are related, together with up to thirty females and young.
The females are often closely related to each other, a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave somewhat like wolf or dog packs, animals that, strangely enough, resemble lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and are also very dangerous to their prey.
A versatile gymnast, the tick, can climb (but not well), swim, jump far, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same genus (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the bull is not like the roar of the lion at full strength, but is more like a sentence with hissing, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds, if they can. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
They see well in the dark with night vision, and also move stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in the environment, and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it came (e.g., if it crosses a mountain range or a river, or if it goes to a new island making it difficult to return), it often ends up in a different environment compared to the one it was in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so this new institution will need different qualities or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what it needed before.
The original institution has generally not changed; it still requires the same adjustments as before.
As the new institute begins to adapt to its new environment, it will become less and less like the other institute.
Eventually, after several thousand or even millions of years, these two populations look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans breathe out.
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is also plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jawbones were set with over 70 knife-sharp teeth, in addition to another set in the palate, which meant that nothing that ran into him escaped.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a cleft tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur, e.g. a tyrannosaurus rex, could not measure up to him.
Although most of their food would have been familiar to us, the Romans also had their strange or unusual things for feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their food on chairs, the rich men liked to have feasts together, where they lay on their sides while they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no Roman from ancient times ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a principal temple, which was considered to be the home of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to take care of the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard, and an inner sanctuary that only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special towers were built, shaped like pyramids, called ziggurats, as part of the temples.
The uppermost part of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The majority of life for Hebrew families took place outdoors.
Women made food in the yard; shops were just open booths facing the street. Stones were used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Few were settled in Greenland. Norse history tells that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and then traveled further west, found Greenland, and called it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there are several differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That's not correct, though. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a tax card.
Behind the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text is visible at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its lifetime, the large parchment document (which is 29¾ inches by 24½ inches in size) was rolled up and placed in storage.
So it is possible that the decree was only added as a marker.
The D-Day invasion and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the southern part was still not free.
He ruled over the "Vichy" French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the aggressors instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
After only two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated Southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a specific culture that a significantly large group of people share, and who live and work interactively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," which means civil or polite, related to the Latin "civis," which means citizen, and "civitas," which means city or city-state, and it also describes, in a way, the size of the society.
City-states precede nations. A civilized culture aims to pass on knowledge through multiple generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and good dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with the Congress as its only part—according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, and, because there was no executive or judicial branch, it was bound to state authorities, who were often uncooperative in enforcing all of its laws.
She also had no authority to invalidate tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles of confederation required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and states paid so little attention to the central government that their representatives were often not present.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second-best team in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic competitions.
In Japan, there are almost 7,000 islands (the largest island is Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island nation in the world!
Because Japan consists of a group of islands, Japan is often, in a geographical context, referred to as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors, passing by, recorded the island under the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiated a change in the indigenous grain cultivation, and employed Chinese workers to work on the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of coastal areas in the west and north of Taiwan, and in 1885 they declared Taiwan to be a province of the Qing Empire.
Following a defeat in 1895 in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings in the periphery have been rebuilt so that tourists can better imagine what they originally looked like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was rebuilt, and the restoration has been ongoing until now.
For example, the most common single-lens image size in the world for photography is 35mm, which was the most common image size at the end of the analogue photography era.
It is still manufactured today, but of even greater importance, the aspect ratio is also used for image sensor sizes in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually a bit misleading, being 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The ratio of this quantity (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio with whole numbers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common sizes (e.g. sizes in the APS family) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often misused or made a mockery of, is a simple guideline that gives the image dynamism, but also preserves a bit of order.
She says that the best place for the main subject is where the lines that divide the picture into thirds vertically and horizontally intersect (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was closely scrutinized.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian faith had bound European kingdoms together, despite them having different languages and different customs.
Her pervasive power influenced everyone, from king to citizen.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funding for the church was specifically for this purpose.
The main authority in the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this centralisation of power and money caused many to doubt whether this principle was being followed.
Shortly after the unrest broke out, Britain began to blockade the sea route to Germany.
The military strategy was effective and significantly cut off important supplies to the military and civilians, although this blockade violated recognized international law, which was based on several international treaties from the last two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering a restricted sea area, which also put neutral ships at risk.
Because little was said about this military tactic, Germany expected a similar response in connection with its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, it was common for most citizens and countries to have a pacifist and isolationist ideology.
After the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, countries did not want to find themselves in such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the USA to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the USA, he had only 4 cents, a notebook, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing different periods; each period in China, or each family that ruled, was a distinct dynasty.
Between each imperial dynasty, there was also an unstable period with discord between the regions. The most well-known was the period of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there were terrible wars between noblemen who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, where thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the great city of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the change from absolute monarchy to republic, a sense of national identity, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, and not a single ruler.
After the revolution, positions were open to all male applicants, giving the most progressive and fortunate the opportunity to advance.
The same applied to the military, because instead of basing ranks in the army on class, they were now based on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people in the working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters that were not about earthly life. He often went to a cave, which came to be called "Hira", in the mountain "Noor" (light) to contemplate.
The cave itself, which has survived weather and wind, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's religious character.
The cave is at the top of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the outside world.
Even if one knows that it exists, it can be difficult to find it. Once inside the cave, one is completely isolated.
Nothing can be seen except for the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains surrounding us. Little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that is not in ruins today.
The Egyptians built the Great Pyramid in the third millennium BC, and it is one of many large pyramids that were built to honor dead pharaohs.
On the Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, lie several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and other family members.
The "bow up" symbol resembles a V, and the "bow down" symbol resembles a staple or a rectangle without the bottom line.
Up means that you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means that you should start at the bow grip (where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bow often creates a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and firmer.
Feel free to write your own markings, but remember that the markings that are there are there for musical reasons, so they should be followed.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789 by a group of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd that shouted and screamed threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to have their carriage windows wide open.
Once, someone in the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard, killed in Versailles, in front of the horrified queen.
The war expenses for the American imperialist campaign in the occupation of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial empire to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest from bonds that were created in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super-profits from the extended exploitation of the Filipino people would be the fundamental benefit from American colonialism.
To understand the temples, one must first understand the context that led to the establishment of the lodge.
The century when these events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, the period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
Before the High Middle Ages was the Early Middle Ages, and afterwards came the Late Middle Ages, which according to old custom ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a range of ideas, from the practical impact or necessity of technology, to a clear sense that human destiny is linked to an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common notions: that the development of technology in itself follows a path largely independent of cultural and political influence, and that technology, on the other hand, has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than dependent on the society.
For example, one might perhaps say that the car necessarily entails road construction.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically sustainable for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Owning a large number of cars also leads to a higher frequency of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new technology within healthcare to repair bodily harm.
Romanticism had a strong flavour of cultural determinism, taken from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In a romantic sense, the landscape shaped individuals, and eventually, customs and culture emerged connected to that landscape, and these, which were in harmony with the place of the community, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known for being the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
He is widely known for being a center of luxury from around 400 AD until around 1100 AD.
His prestige diminished in the 12th century, especially because the crusaders had returned home with gifts, such as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was around that time that the title of Fashion Capital was moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th and the 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture to the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments then, due to the Crusades, was that people began using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that is done to only produce enough food for the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses stored seeds originating in the ecosystem, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple practices that increase the yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Sects bring like-minded individuals together who feel marginalized by societal norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Organizations can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a particular narrative as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a particular subculture often display their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, encompassing fashion, behaviour, and language.
One of the most common approaches to illustrating the importance of socialization is to use the few tragic examples of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Such children are called "unsocialized" or wild. Some unsocialized children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this betrayal of the child was due to the parents dismissing a serious deficiency in the child's mind or body.
Unruly children may have experienced serious child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others, it seems, have been raised by animals; and it is said that some have lived alone in nature.
When raised by non-human animals, the uncivilized child's behavior (within physical limitations) is almost completely like that of the particular caregiving animal, e.g., the fear or indifference towards humans.
Even though project-based teaching should have made learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of teaching, but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals who are in the process of a new attempt to learn something, for example, to use a new computer program or to undertake a new project.
Scaffolding can be both figurative and literal, meaning a teacher is a type of scaffold, but so is the little Clippy man in Microsoft Office.
Scaffolding features are built into the software and are there to ask questions, remind, and explain procedures that might have been difficult for the student to deal with alone.
Children are taken into foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even oppression.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but they do.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe space for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, caring foster parents, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide everything necessary that was missing from the home they were previously taken from.
The internet blends aspects of both mass communication and personal communication.
The special characteristics of the internet lead to multiple layers when it comes to use and satisfaction.
For example, "to learn" and "to communicate" are considered important reasons to use the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal connection" and "developing relationships" were also identified as new contributing aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined how readers were affected by websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that one can tell if someone is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
In his essay, "Presidential Speech," Oliver Sacks pointed out that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may also exist in animals, such as tame dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups with genetic differences: hidden and obvious.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the population with significant deviation.
Segregation and recombination of new mixtures cause variation back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
Out on the grassland, it is difficult for primates, with a digestive system similar to humans, to satisfy their need for amino acids with the available plant resources.
Furthermore, it has serious consequences if it does not succeed: growth retardation, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The plant resources that are easiest to access would be the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are processed.
On the contrary, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but it also provides large amounts of protein, which contains all the necessary amino acids.
All things considered, it shouldn't surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way somewhat similar to what chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep fragmentation is a process where you deliberately wake up during your usual sleep period and then fall back asleep shortly after (10–60 minutes).
This is easy to do by using a relatively quiet alarm to bring you around without waking you up completely.
If you reset your alarm while sleepy, you can place it at the other end of the room to force you out of bed to turn it off.
Other options, based on biorhythms, may be to drink plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces you up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force that is present. Each person has the opportunity to find perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but was expanded by the Mahayana path of compassion and by many practices from Indian yoga.
The central principle in Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
Through kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (the enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The cornerstone of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through visualizations of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras become active, and awareness of enlightenment is established.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which resulted in cooperation between the USSR and the USA. When the war was over, systems, processes and cultures clashed, which led to uncertainty between the countries.
Two years after the war, the coalition members were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last 40 years and would be fraught with proxy wars on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been destroyed, and the only hope was to evade and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became useless after almost only a day, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian military fronts, after it had invaded the eastern part of Poland, which was in conflict with the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pacts, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transportation is definitely the best way to move large quantities of people and goods by sea.
The task of naval forces has usually been to ensure that your country can continue to transport people and goods, while preventing enemies from transporting their people and goods.
One of the most remarkable new examples of this was the Battle of the North Atlantic during World War II. The Americans tried to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, mostly using submarines, tried to prevent this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have managed to occupy Britain, as it already had the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes kept them to have access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Goatherds, who were often children or adolescents and resembled the better-known shepherd, often tended the domestic goats, which usually roamed in flocks on hills or other pastures. These methods of tending are still used today.
Already in the 16th century, wagonways were built in England.
Although the wagonways were only composed of wooden planks laid side by side, they helped the horses that pulled them to walk faster and pull larger loads than they could on the rather uneven roads that existed at that time.
The iron track wedges came into use quite early to hold the tracks in place. However, it gradually became clear that the tracks would have worked better if they had an iron band on top.
This became common practice, but the iron wore down the wooden wheels on the wagons more.
As time went on, iron wheels were used instead of wooden wheels. In 1767, the first rails made of pure iron appeared.
The first known way to travel was by walking; humans began walking upright about two million years ago when Homo erectus (which means upright man) came into existence.
The early humans, australopithecus, did not walk upright regularly.
Bipedal gait is present in 4.2–3.9 million-year-old fossil remains from australopithecus, although sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to, to some extent, prevent future suffering.
This is often like treating symptoms. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we must also find the root of the problems and stop them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind, and the problems have become greater due to excessive population growth and the wasteful lifestyle of humans.
After the Congress approved it on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by John Hancock, President of the Congress, and Charles Thomson, Secretary, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
Between 150 and 200 copies were printed during the night, which are now called the "Dunlap broadsides".
John Nixon publicly read the document aloud for the first time on July 8 in the yard at Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his units in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest manuscripts of the document that we know of that still exist. The original handwritten document no longer exists.
Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live today. We call them birds.
Many don't think that they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still resemble dinosaurs in several ways.
They have feet with webbing and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Almost all computers today are based on processed information that is programmed in binary code.
A binary digit can only be one of two numbers, which are 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately apparent. Some symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common that it's impossible to determine the cause right away.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be an open container of medicine or poisonous household products nearby.
Check if the label gives direct instructions for first aid for the specific type of poison.
The term "lice" is used by carcinologists in common parlance for this group of small crustaceans.
This expression comes from old knowledge about bedbugs, which are small insects that are extremely adapted to feeding on humans.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs are nidicolous, they are adapted to live in the nests or dwellings of their host.
In the USA, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies show that women are twice as likely to develop MS compared to men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or the child's, to raise a child.
This couple may choose to give their child up for adoption.
In an adoption, the parents relinquish their parental rights so that the other couple can be parents to the child.
The main purpose of science is, using scientific methods, to figure out how the world works. This method is used in most scientific studies.
It's not just about tests, where a test is an experiment used to rule out one or more possible causes, but also about asking questions, observing, and conducting scientific investigations.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical writings and, in particular, the Bible in Latin.
The thoughts of Aristotle on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek diminished, the Greek philosophical and scientific roots of the Western world disappeared.
Many observed that the course of psychology and behavior was often completely dependent on the presence of internal circuits and their production through the biological clock.
It is confirmed that most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, have regular rhythms that do not only come from regular external cues.
Biological clocks are oscillators that maintain themselves in motion and continue with an independent cycle for a period of time, even though there are no external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading indications that DNA was hereditary material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, where they either labeled the DNA in the bacterium with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the bacterium with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type of mutation, how critical the affected genetic material is, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be inherited by children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting areas with nature to enjoy the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, taking photos, birdwatching, visiting protected areas, and reading information about the ecosystem.
One example is to travel to Borneo to take pictures of and learn about orangutans.
Every morning, people from small villages go by car to their workplace, passing by other people who are going where the first group came from, because they have their workplace there.
In this bustling transport network, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this enormous carbon economy has disrupted the stable foundation of the biosphere, which has sustained human development for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developing countries, you rarely hear complaints on a similar level about water quality or about bridges collapsing.
Why do traffic systems cause so many complaints, and why do they fail almost daily? Are traffic engineers just incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental at play?
Traffic Flow is research into the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations, and into the influence they have on each other.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to research how well traffic flows, because it's impossible to know with 100% certainty how a driver will behave.
Fortunately, most drivers have a behavior that lies within a reasonably reliable margin; therefore, traffic is often quite monotonous and can, to a certain extent, be described mathematically.
To better illustrate how smoothly traffic flows, three distinct characteristics have been created: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These conditions help to plan, design, and operate transportation facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape enemies and find food and mates.
Most small insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them more small places to hide from predators.
Today, goldsmith beetles and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought it was correct, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It has more than 8 times as much water as the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth; in some places, it is six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of all the water that runs from all the rivers on the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River's main course is 6,387 km long. Water from several thousand small rivers flows into it.
Although pyramid construction from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, no pyramids were larger or more technically outstanding in their construction than the pyramids of Giza.
Ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which by that time were more than a thousand years old.
There are approximately 800 inhabitants in Vatican City. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and it is the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian to communicate regarding legislation and official matters.
Most of those who work for the state also speak Italian in their daily lives, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times, because they are all found in nature in their native state and are relatively easy to extract with simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed a theory that everything is made of a mixture with one or more of four basic elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also came up with a theory that they changed into other substances to create what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements, such as calcium and potassium, are considered to be metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Some alloys contain small amounts of elements that are not metals, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of elements. All elements are made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a welcome convenience for many when it appeared.
As newer ways of writing have emerged, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and to less important purposes.
People who write messages on a computer screen never have to so much as look at a pencil sharpener.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something new comes along.
Fission bombs work on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Something like rolling a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the core again will release some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they have a tendency to decay, even if they are only slightly affected or not affected at all.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick closest to and 100 km thick furthest away.
It is thinner under the moon mountains and highlands.
Perhaps there are more lunar domes closer together because the crust is thinner. It was easier for magma to come up through the surface.
Theories of customer satisfaction focus on identifying the underlying reasons for who people are or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are built-in as they mature.
These theories look at what it is that makes certain people desire what they desire, and what things in their environment cause them to behave in a certain way.
Two common theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can arise when leaders begin to have authority over someone who was previously an equal. In one extreme of possibilities, one still tries to "fit in" as an equal.
This type of leader is poor at making unpopular decisions, correcting others, conducting evaluations, delegating responsibility, and holding others accountable.
In the extreme reaches of possibility, one is transformed into a complete stranger who feels compelled to change everything the team has done, and do it themselves.
The leader ultimately has the responsibility for whether the team succeeds or not.
This behavior often stems from disagreement between the leader and the rest of the team.
Hybrid teams should have the same quality as regular teams, but there is a slight difference.
The members of an advisory board often represent their local group.
They often have more flexible schedules than regular teammates, because their team may need to meet in a way that accommodates multiple time zones, which the local management may not understand.
Having a true "invisible team" in place (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a distinct characteristic of a pseudo-team.
The "Invisible Team" is the leading team, to which each member reports on all matters. The Invisible Team sets rules for each member.
Why would an organisation embark on a time-consuming process in order to lay the foundation for a learning organisation? Innovation is one purpose of promoting education within the organisation.
When all available resources are used effectively across departments within the organization, creativity and innovation can flourish.
The result will be that as an organisation collaborates to overcome an obstacle, it can lead to new, innovative procedures that benefit the customer.
In order for an organization to be innovative, the management must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and training within the organization.
Angel (2006) explains that Community is a method that should help associations achieve more.
Neuroscientific data provide concrete evidence for a theoretical approach to studying perception. Consequently, the field of research becomes smaller and much more precise.
The connection between brain disease and behavior is supported by scientists and their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, psychological trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and alter various functions in the brain.
Newly arrived technology helps us see and examine brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and a lot of material to create realistic models that can help us understand the processes in our heads.
Although artificial intelligence has strong connotations regarding future fiction, artificial intelligence is an important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in computer science involves getting machines to automatically solve tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples include managing, planning, the ability to respond to analyses and questions from customers, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and faces.
This has become a subject of study in its own right, focusing on solving everyday problems.
Computer technology is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, and is often built into many household computers and consumer electronics for computer games.
Field trips are an important part of every class. Teachers often like to take their students on trips to visit places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers the possibility of virtual excursions. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or enjoy beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Going on a trip together is also a good way to reflect on a journey and share your experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state's capital; a new version of the website is created each year, but older versions are still available online as a scrapbook.
Blogging can also help students to write better. Although students who write blogs often have poor grammar and spell badly at the beginning, this is often changed when readers are present.
Because students are often among the most critical readers, the person writing the blog will try to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging "forces the student to understand the world better." The need to satisfy the interest of the readership inspires students to be more insightful and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging also encourages collaboration, and that students extend their learning beyond the regular school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to be more analytical and critical; by participating in online discussions, students can clarify their position regarding what others write about, in addition to making their own opinions on specific topics clear (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is a fascinating bilingual capital of Canada, and offers a plethora of art galleries and museums, showcasing Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is further south, and to the north is the untouched, natural, beautiful landscape of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this and more sheds light on Ontario, as it is seen by outsiders to be the Canadian core.
Few people reside in the larger areas further north, and in some places it is almost a desolate wilderness.
A comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and can be called a continent in itself when it comes to its wildlife.
Many of the smaller islands are independent nations or overseas territories of France, and are known as luxury bathing resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam with them to the countries, and it really took root in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, the border is with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their marital status.
It helps to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to something they might perceive as harassment. It is not unusual to be followed, touched on the arm, etc.
Be decisive when you say no to men, and don't be afraid to stand firm in your decision (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but left the town deserted after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the town as Daru I-Badya, and the town received the name Casablanca from Spanish merchants, who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, water pipes, and all sorts of trinkets, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the streets in the city, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside of Goma should be carefully examined beforehand, in order to understand why the fighting persists in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for those who go up to the Nyiragongo volcano, and it is also possible to buy some of the cheapest tours to see mountain gorillas in Africa there.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The typical (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with the fact that it is relatively inaccessible, "Timbuktu" is used as a figure of speech for distant and foreign lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a city in distress, despite the narrative making it a tourist destination and the fact that it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat to the Aïr and Ténéré Natural Reserves.
It was one of the major stopping points in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special: Wonders of the African World.
Compared to the other towns in the country, it has a distinctly Arabic rather than African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-eastern part of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and to the south, the border is the Crocodile River.
The protected area covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different environmental areas, each supporting various animal life.
It is one of the main tourist destinations in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all other protected areas in South Africa, an access and conservation fee is charged for the areas.
It may also be worthwhile to purchase a so-called Wild Card, which gives access to a portion of the protected areas in South Africa or to all the protected areas.
Hong Kong Island lends its name to the entire Hong Kong area and is the place that many tourists consider the main tourist destination.
The row of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering bar chart reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, it is necessary to leave the island and move to the Kowloon waterfront, which lies opposite.
A large part of Hong Kong's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land on the northern seashore.
This is the place the British colonizers claimed as their own. So if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial history, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km inland from the coast into the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within the Indian border is called the Sundarbans Conservation Area.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps - they contain some of the last remnants of the magnificent forests that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km². Of this, one-third is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus stations (across the river) throughout the day, although most that head eastwards and towards Jakar/Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because the intercity buses are often full, it is recommended to buy the ticket a few days before departure.
Most regions are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are good and sturdily built.
Rental cars are a fast and good way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and it has two lanes that are 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction began in August 2011, and traffic was not allowed through until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the customs inspection stations on the Brazilian side are completed.
The Guarani people were the most important indigenous group in what is now the eastern part of Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also used the land for planting.
The Chaco area also had other indigenous ethnic groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The immense province of the Indies," was founded as a result of the Spanish victory over indigenous tribal groups.
The Spanish initiated the colonial era, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has preserved much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having the best polo team and the best polo players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year is in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller competitions and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about competitions and information on where to get tickets for polo matches, check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP) at a 1:1 ratio.
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, located in Stanley, across from the FIC West shop.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outlying islands, they may not accept credit cards even though they accept British and American cash; ask the owners beforehand to check how you can pay.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so remember to exchange the money before you leave the island.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the low tropics; in the summer months, it is not uncommon for temperatures to reach +30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: it doesn't usually freeze, but the wind and moisture in the air combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
Here, there isn't a specific "rainy" or "dry" season: the amount of rain is about the same all year round.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should therefore not be fed or disturbed.
According to local authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how tame they may look, bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year, many visitors get hurt because they didn't keep a suitable distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so leave them in peace.
Be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid having or making fragrant food and keep a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and the population is just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
Tórshavn was the site of a scandalous ship strike in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to sail out of the harbor.
All the ships, except for one British cruiser, were sunk. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, coordinated by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the killing of the leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland encompasses two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) lie on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most of them have shade from pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in the middle of Auckland.
These are sometimes overcrowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the beach. It is safe to swim.
The main beer on tap is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but it's good and refreshing. The other beers on tap are called "Manta".
There are many French wines to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A short black is an 'espresso', a cappuccino comes with a pile of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The chocolate lives up to Belgian quality. The fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reefs occur throughout the year, and damage to the reefs caused by these trips is rare.
Still, heed advice from authorities, respect all signs, and listen to safety warnings.
Sei whales are found near the coasts and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes be seen outside of these times.
Sharks are there, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the open ocean; they primarily reside in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind knowing that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with certain accommodations, but despite that, it may be possible to book other types of stays, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer package tours that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also save the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer, or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. entry permits).
However, any changes or requests should go through the travel agency first and not directly to the accommodation.
For some celebrations, the majority of participants choose to camp on site, and most participants consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be right in the middle of the action, you need to arrive early to get a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages is finished, there may be parts of the festival that continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you travel across the Nordic-Baltic region during the winter, check where your cabin is, because going through ice makes such a terrible noise for those who are most affected.
Time in the city is included in St. Petersburg trips. Cruise ship passengers are exempt from having an entry permit (check the conditions).
Casinos are known for making many attempts to get guests to spend as much time and money as possible. Windows and clocks are usually not present, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers with food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and keep them staying at the venue.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks on the house. But intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know that it's important to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On slippery and snow-covered roads, the friction is low, and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can accumulate in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be reduced by snowdrift, dust, condensation, or ice on car windows.
However, conditions with ice and snow are common in many countries, and traffic continues, mostly steadily throughout the year.
Safari trips are perhaps what attract the most tourists to Africa, and are a highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" in wider use refers to traveling across land to see captivating African wildlife, especially on grasslands.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles very closely, and standard equipment provides a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you see them better with binoculars.
A hiking trip (also called "kjarrgonga", "hiking safari", or going "fótandi") involves walking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Olympic Games in the summer, having previously hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a complicated situation.
Cancellation insurances vary, but from late March, most cancellation insurances were not valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with the most common price being around ¥7000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many guesthouses have irons and ironing boards available to borrow, even if one is not in the room.
If there is no iron available, or if you don't feel like wearing freshly ironed socks, you can try a hair dryer, if one is available.
Make sure that clothes do not get too hot (which can lead to shrinkage or, in severe cases, burning).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for one minute, in others, it is necessary to boil for several minutes.
Filters have varying degrees of effectiveness, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Tourists may encounter pests that they are not used to in their home country.
Pests can spoil food, cause structural damage, or in a worst-case scenario, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or carry infection.
Contagious diseases in themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force, are usually not classified as plagues.
Buying duty-free gives you the opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from tax in certain places.
Tourists who travel to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on goods such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, where one frequently passes through isolated forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, then keep a cool head: steep slopes, narrow roads and sharp turns are perfectly normal.
The speed limits are significantly lower than on the stretches before and after — usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) — and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
As strange as it sounds, the mobile phone connection is much better here than on many other stretches of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria they are undoubtedly rich and varied, of the same kind as those of their southern neighbors, Austria.
Fruitcakes are common, with apples baked into cakes year-round, while cherries and plums make an appearance in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other types of nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but heavy cakes, then try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry dish is a dish that is based on herbs and spices, together with either meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on how much liquid is in it.
In areas of inland North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry dishes; in South India and in some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a collective term that encompasses many different types of cuisine from regions around the nation.
However, if it's used without any reservation, the term probably refers to the food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, includes a wealth of simple, spicy dishes where the main Javanese flavors are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various fragrant spices.
Stirrups are supports for the feet when riding, hanging downwards on either side of the saddle.
They give better stability to the rider, but can have safety issues, because the rider's feet can potentially get stuck.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but has one foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged behind if the horse runs away. To reduce the danger, there are several safety measures that can be taken.
One thing is that most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth and fairly narrow sole.
Another thing is that some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that cause the leather of a stirrup to fall off the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a rider who falls.
Cochamó Valley - the premier climbing destination in Chile, known as the South American Yosemite, with a large selection of big granite walls and boulders.
Some of the peaks have breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are still creating new routes among the endless possibilities of the walls.
Winter sports involving downhill movement, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports where one slides down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard under their feet.
Cross-country skiing is a major tourist activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski area regulars," who plan entire vacations around cross-country skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is ancient — cave paintings depict skiers as far back as 5000 BC.
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Cross-country skiing: This activity is also called Nordic skiing, ski touring, or ski trips.
It resembles it, but usually doesn't include ski trips in the Alps or mountain climbing, the latter of which takes place on steep terrain and requires tougher skis and boots.
Think of the ski trails as similar routes to hiking trails.
In good conditions, you can go much further than if you walk – but it is rare that you reach the speed on skis as you do cross-country skiing on long distances without a heavy backpack along smooth paths.
Europe is a relatively small part of the world, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, when traveling through several countries, one would have to fill out several applications for entry permits and go through several passport controls.
However, the Schengen area functions, in a way, somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you are in this area, you can usually travel across borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, it is not necessary to apply for a visa in each individual Schengen country separately, and therefore you save time, money, and paperwork.
There is no general rule that defines which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax authorities classify goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The regulation has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America and Europe.
Handcrafted goods can be classified as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important industry for the Sami people, and the culture within this profession is also significant for many with other occupations.
But even traditionally, not all Sámi have been engaged in extensive reindeer husbandry, but lived off fishing, hunting and the like, and mostly kept reindeer as draught animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern industries. Tourism is a significant source of income in Sápmi, the Sami region.
Even though it is widely used, especially among people who are not Roma, the word "Gypsy" is considered derogatory because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.
If the country you are going to visit becomes subject to travel advice, your health insurance or cancellation of the trip may be affected.
You can also seek advice from governments that are not your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East may find themselves in different situations than Europeans and Arabs.
Guidelines are just a short summary of the political situation in a country.
The viewpoints are often loosely presented, common, and oversimplified compared to the precise information that is available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the common name for all dangerous weather phenomena that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or death.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topographical surveys, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, unusually heavy rainfall, and wildfires are types of severe weather, and so are thunderstorms, blizzards, and tornadoes.
Localized and seasonal instances of severe weather include snowstorms, blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Tourists are strongly advised to be aware of the dangers of severe weather in their areas, as it may affect travel plans.
Everyone planning to visit a country that can be seen as a war zone should receive special training.
A search on the internet for 'Hostile environment course' will probably give you an address of a local company.
A course usually covers detailed information about all the problems discussed here, usually with practical experiments.
A course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, extensive first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few in number.
Tourists who are planning gender reassignment surgeries abroad must ensure that they bring documents that are valid for the return journey.
Government policies vary regarding the issuance of passports with a non-binary (X) gender marker or documents updated to reflect a preferred name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents varies.
Security screening checks have also become much more intrusive in the period following September 11, 2001.
Transgender people prior to surgery should not expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are return flows from waves that hit the shore, often in a reef or similar formation.
Due to topographical investigations under the sea, the returning current is concentrated in a few deep areas, and a rapid deep-water current can form there.
Most fatalities occur as a result of exhaustion in the attempt to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you are out of the current, it is no more difficult to swim back than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be captured again or, depending on your merits and whether anyone has noticed you, you can wait for rescue.
Culture shock takes longer to recover from and can be more severe, while reverse culture shock comes faster (there's no honeymoon phase).
Travelers who easily adapted to new cultures sometimes had difficulty readjusting to their original culture.
Having returned home after a period abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and abandoned habits from your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and well-meaning, because they knew that tourists in a new country have to adapt.
People might not expect that tolerance and common sense are also necessary for tourists to be able to get home.
The Pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You see the pyramids in the darkness, and you see them in the peace before the show begins.
Usually, the sound of tourists and vendors is always heard. The story of sound and light is just like a fairytale book.
The Sphinx is used as a backdrop and narrator for a long story.
The pictures are displayed on the pyramids, and light is shone on the various pyramids.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano creates a magnificent natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the peninsula, which is marked by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge with the plateau, and then emerge again to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which tops at 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote locations with no phone connection, a satellite phone might be your only solution.
A satellite phone does not usually replace a mobile phone, because it is necessary to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a phone call.
The service is often used at sea, including on pleasure boats, and on research expeditions that require data and voice in a remote location.
Your local telephone provider should have been able to give you information on how to contact this service.
A more and more popular option for those who plan to take a year off to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among those who have finished school, because it allows them to take a year off without affecting their education.
In many cases, a course taken during this gap year can improve your chances of getting into higher education in your home country.
Usually there is a tuition fee to participate in these informative courses.
Finland is an excellent destination for sailing. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in its lakes and archipelagos.
Between the islands and on the lakes, it's not certain that you need a pleasure boat.
Although the island groups near the coast and the largest lakes are big enough for pleasure boats, smaller boats and even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every 7 or 8 people.
In this respect, Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand are no different, but it is otherwise quite unique (e.g., the counting system is base 40 in the Netherlands).
Most Baltic cruises offer a long stopover in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several whole days even though you come back and sleep onboard the ship at night.
If you only go ashore via ship excursions, you do not need a special visa (valid from 2009).
Some tours with the cruise ship include Berlin in Germany as part of the brochure. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by airplane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a frightening incident.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different than something you personally fear or dislike that many other people also have.
For some, it can help to understand something about how an airplane works and what happens onboard a flight, in order to overcome this fear of the unknown or of not being able to control what is happening.
Courier companies are paid well to deliver goods quickly. Often, time is of the essence with work documents, commercial goods, and spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies, this is a problem.
If the items are sent by air freight, it can take a few days to get them through customs on some routes.
The only way to get it faster is to send it as checked baggage. Airline rules don't allow sending baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a large sum of money for these privileges (or, even better, to have your workplace do it for you).
However, this is still not cheap: a rule of thumb says that you can expect to pay up to four times the normal price of business class and 11 times for first class!
It's usually not worth looking for deals on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that a certain core group of travelers is willing to pay the highest price for the privilege of getting to a place quickly and easily, and price accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The language spoken there is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.

Please treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the area by marking or scratching graffiti on buildings.
The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Around half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, because it is legally established as the primary official language.

Regular announcements in the underground system are only in Catalan, but disruptions that are not planned are announced by an automated system in many different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being smug, unfriendly, and haughty.
Even though this is often just a vague idea, the best way to get by in Paris is still to behave well and act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). That makes it considerably easier to manage.
The haughty appearance of Parisians quickly disappears if you show courteous behavior.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered in forest, primarily with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and the vegetation is a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean flora.
He has a particularly wide selection of plant communities, due to his series of microclimates, diverse soils, and varying altitudes.
This area is also home to a great variety of animals and birds.
Rare fauna, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and capercaillie are to be found there, in addition to many more common species.
It is required that women, when they visit monasteries, wear a skirt that goes down past the knees, in addition to their shoulders also being covered.
Most monasteries provide unprepared women with yarn, but if you have your own with you, especially if it has light colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, it is required that men wear trousers that go past the knees.
These are also available in the storage area by the entrance, but the garments are not washed between each user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these shirts. Same size for all men!
The cuisine of Mallorca, like other areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used constantly.

All nouns, in addition to the word "Sie" (formal you), are capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and participles.
It can also make it easier to read, but writing it is rather complicated, because it is necessary to know if a verb or adjective is used in a noun form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to watch out for are c and g, because their pronunciation changes depending on what vowel follows.
Also make sure that you pronounce r differently than rr: caro means good, while carro means wagon.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, it will help you to read this introductory book on grammar, in order to learn a lot about Persian grammar and to better understand idioms.
If you speak a Romance language, it is of course easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But people who know a little Spanish might be quick to decide that Portuguese resembles it so much that it is not necessary to study it separately.
Pre-modern astronomical observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums or educational institutions.
Because light pollution was not as big of a problem in its early days as it is today, they are usually in towns or school areas, and are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes for research are incredibly large facilities in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Watching cherry blossom trees in bloom, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were of particular interest.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor, only for himself and other members of the nobility in the empire.
Plants look best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just one" specimen.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have been widely adopted, including by people who are not religious in Christian countries and people who are not Christian around the world.
It is a custom to stay up all Easter night in an open place to see the sunrise.
There are of course Christian, theological explanations for this custom, but it may well have been a pre-Christian spring and fertility custom.
More traditional churches hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, where congregations begin to celebrate Jesus' resurrection when the clock strikes twelve.
All animals that originally came to the islands arrived either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, and the giant tortoise is the primary animal that grazes in the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, several mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides an opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is dark for most of the day.
Because there are so few people in the areas, light pollution is rarely a problem, and therefore you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what a Westerner might be used to.
It is common to wear formal attire and for colleagues to address each other by surname or job title.
Collaboration in the workplace is crucial and emphasis is placed on group performance, rather than praising individual results.
Workers often need permission from their supervisors before making a decision, and it is expected that they follow their supervisors' instructions without questioning them.
