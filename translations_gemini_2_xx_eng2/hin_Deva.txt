This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already prevalent, but it also provides information that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the pores of this animal were brown, and the color beneath the carotenoid was brownish-brown.
This discovery also provides complete information about the evolution of feathers in birds.
However, the shafts of dinosaur feathers are not fully developed and are called rachis, but their feathers have other features like barbs and barbules. Researchers speculate that, like other dinosaur features, the rachis may have developed later.
The structure of the wings suggests they were used not for flight, but for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggested that, even if it is a juvenile dinosaur's tail, the specimen represents an adult sawfish, not the lower part of a juvenile.
Researchers suggested that even though it is the tail of a small dinosaur, the plumage of the specimen appears to be from an adult, not a juvenile.

Most of the work done was theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations made from the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for is likely caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory suggests that the densest dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located in the form of a halo and is composed of numerous small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "very worrying and dangerous due to its very high mortality rate."
Dr. Mall believes that some patients must have contracted the infection in the hospital itself, and at least two of these were hospital healthcare workers.
Over the course of a year, one infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB among the entire group of people with tuberculosis is still low; in South Africa, 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people are infected at any given time.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and insert a pre-printed sheet of paper representing their chosen candidate into an envelope.
Once the officer confirms the voter's identity, the voter deposits the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting roll.
France's electoral law strictly codifies the process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes or votes other than valid votes inside the ballot box before polling begins.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted under strict supervision by volunteers following specific procedures.

The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at Edinburgh Sheriff Court, accused of his son's murder.
The indictment and trial are pending, but any eyewitness could be influenced, as his/her image has been widely publicized.
This is common elsewhere in Britain, but Scottish justice operates differently, and the courts have viewed the publication of the pictures as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee writes, "If photos etc. of suspects are published, journalists seem to be treading a dangerous path."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no comment will be made at least until charges are brought.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute that Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other reportedly included topics involve the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the Jordan Valley issue.
After signing an agreement, Israel seeks to maintain the current military situation for the next ten years, while the PA agrees to continue the current military situation for only five years.
Just as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated, the supplemental pest control trial was to be closely monitored by rangers for shooters.
Under a talent hunting show, capable volunteers were recruited in a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW).
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage for NPWS, the first four shooters selected for the shooting operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the former CEP's resignation as part of a package of measures for the country to move towards new elections.
The commission was formed as Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Since 2011, violent protests have occasionally erupted due to delays in holding elections.
Around 60 cases of iPod overheating malfunctions have been reported, resulting in fire six times and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had 34 reported cases of overheating that the company did not take seriously.
The ministry responded to Apple's report postponement by saying it is "certainly regrettable."
The earthquake in Mariana occurred at 07:19 am local time (09:19 pm GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said that no reports of damage had been received in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no indications of a tsunami.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman hijacked a bus and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
So far, several hostages have been rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released quickly, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced an elderly woman because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza had been shot.
Liggins, like his father, began his career in the field of medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births during his free time.
Their research revealed that if hormones were brought into effect, it would accelerate the maturation of a baby's fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two 'black box' flight recorders.
Luna was also paid tribute by fellow wrestlers.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a famous night with two moons. That night was as special as she was. She was an incredibly powerful woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as weird as me...maybe even more so...love her and will miss her...hope she's in a better place."
Leading up to the 2010 federal election, 1,400 people voted, and there was an 8 percent increase in the number of people opposing Australia becoming a republic since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of them, sharing this opinion in the vote, expressed their desire to make Queen Elizabeth II the last Queen of Australia.
According to the survey results, 29 percent of the people surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been in doubt due to his complaints.
They became unable to take the necessary medication to alleviate their pain because the medications were banned in sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water distribution on Earth, along with asteroids.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Earlier this year, the 53-year-old Cuomo began his term and last month signed a bill legalizing gay marriage.
He called the rumors "political garbage and foolish."
They have predicted he will win the presidency in 2016.
The FAA claims that the NextGen system will make it possible for aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology, which, unlike older ground-radar-based technology, helps air traffic controllers guide aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation is being provided and Overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking at the ground and park and ride facilities will not be available.
The fear of lack of transportation has increased the possibility that the sports team will be forced to play behind closed doors without supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was said that the process would take much longer due to breeding between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any shape. It can be molded into small sizes.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can be bent and braided. It can be beaten or made into sheets.
It can be made quite thin and applied to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-made illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can create an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether the chemical environment is acidic or alkaline (basic).
pH level is determined by the concentration of hydrogen ions (H present in pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because a hydrogen atom is made up of one proton and one electron).
Combine both dry powders together, then squeeze them into a ball with clean, damp hands.
The moisture from your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and create a kind of coating.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were part of bathhouses, which both men and women used together in groups.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use satellites.
The satellite receives a call in space and then reflects it back down at the same time.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
Placing a satellite or telescope in space requires large rockets, over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world extraordinarily. The biggest thing is that the wheel has given us easier and faster transportation.
It has given us trains, cars, and many other similar means of transportation.
They include more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to gazelles and deer.
Finally, there are many feral and stray cats (including loose pet cats) that prey on various small creatures such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Each cat has a specific task that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the largest social cats, living in large groups called prides.
A group of lions consists of one to three adult males, along with more than thirty females and cubs.
Being part of a large family of sisters and daughters, females are usually closely connected to each other.
A pride of lions functions much like a pack of wolves or dogs, which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in animal behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
Like a fully developed athlete, a tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
Like tigers, leopards, and jaguars, lions belong to the same genus (Panthera). These are the only four cats that can roar.
A tiger's roar isn't like the sharp, resounding roar of a lion, but is more of a guttural, scream-like sound.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can catch them, they will prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots prey on are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and hunt (prey on) animals by scent, sniffing where they might have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the darkness of night and move forward very stealthily. Ocelots hunt by roaming around their surrounding area and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originated (such as if they came from a mountain range or river, or if they go to a new island so they can't easily go back), they often find themselves in a different environment.
This new place has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need to adopt different traits or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than before.
There has been no change in the original population; they still desire the same kind of adaptation as before.
Over time, as a new population adapts to a new environment, it too begins to overlook things like other populations do.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is a good step and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans use for breathing, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (i.e., breathe out).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes with plants, and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared no one except other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were filled with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a barbed tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been a cannibal as well.
They would even attack anything that went into the water, so much so that even a giant dinosaur like a T. Rex would be no match.
While most of their dishes would be familiar to us, the Romans incorporated their share of strange or unusual feast items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, rich people preferred to feast together and enjoyed themselves while eating.
Ancient Roman food could not have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The inhabitants of Babylon built a primary temple for each of their deities, which was considered the god's home.
People bring offerings for the deities, and priests serve the deities by dedicating their time to events and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctum, which only priests could enter.
Distinct pyramid-shaped towers (pagodas), sometimes also known as ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The tower's top was a special sanctuary for the deity.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a home was not as essential.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent in the open air.
The women cooked food in the courtyard; store counters were visible on the street. Stone was used in the construction of the house.
Due to the lack of large forests in the land of Canaan, wood was very expensive there.
Greenland was very sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further west, found Greenland, which he named Greenland.
But regardless of their discovery, the Eskimo tribe was already living there at that time.
Although every country was 'Scandinavian,' there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The words written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were: "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows who wrote it, the large leather-bound paper document (measuring 24½ inches by 29¾) was compiled for collection.
Therefore, it is being assumed that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but southern France was still not free.
This "Vichy" was governed by the French. These were the same French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were advancing towards Germany.
A culture shared among a large group of people is called a civilization. Here, people live in society with mutual cooperation and work together.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning 'citizen,' related to the Latin civis, meaning 'citizen,' and civitas, meaning 'city or city-state,' and it also defines, in a way, the shape of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilizational culture implies the passing of knowledge through generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and equitable dissemination.
Small cultures disappear without significant historical evidence and do not attain the status of a civilization.
Under the Articles of Confederation, during the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government in which Congress was its sole component.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes because there was no national executive or judiciary. It was dependent on state authorities, who were often uncooperative in enforcing all its measures.
It also had no power to override tax laws and duties between its states.
Unanimous agreement from all states was required before the article could be amended, and the states did not take the central government seriously, with their representatives often not even attending the assembly.
In terms of success, the Italian national football team comes after the German national football team; they were the winners of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
With Italians competing in international games and Olympic events, winter sports are most popular in the northern regions.
Japan has around 7,000 islands (the largest island being Honshu). This makes Japan home to the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to having a group of islands, Japan is often geographically referred to as "the Archipelago".
Taiwan was discovered in the 15th century by European sailors, who called the island Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating changes in indigenous grain production methods and employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forcibly occupied the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings along the perimeter of the campus have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most widely used photography format in the world is 35mm. It was quite popular at the end of the analog film era.
It is still made today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually a bit misleading, as it's 24mm in height by 36mm in width.
The aspect ratio in this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Several common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are approximately equal to or around this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that brings dynamism to an image while maintaining a measure of order.
This suggests that the most effective placement for the main subject is where lines dividing the image diagonally and horizontally intersect (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
Despite differences in language and customs, Christianity has bound European countries together for thousands of years.
Its pervasive power affected everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the Church's monetary funds exist specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church in Rome has been in place for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money in one place has led many to question whether its principles were being fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off crucial military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated international law as commonly accepted by numerous international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the sea, creating a hazard even for ships standing off the coast.
Since this strategy had received a limited response, Germany expected a similar response regarding its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Pacifism and isolationism were prevalent attitudes among most citizens and countries during the 1920s.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations yearned to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla immigrated to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
Arriving in America, he had 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation addressed to Thomas Edison (written by his previous job's manager).
Ancient China had a unique way of denoting different time periods; each phase of China, or each family that was in power, was a distinct dynasty.
Besides this, it was a period of instability in every dynasty regarding the division of states. During this period, the 60-year-long struggle between the Han and Jin dynasties over the division of three states is quite famous.
During this period, fierce battles took place among many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest stains in the history of ancient China, with thousands dying as they fought for the highest seat in the magnificent palace in Xi'an.
The use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, the transition to nationalism, and the idea that the country's trust lies in the people and not in a single ruler, have a very significant social and political impact.
Furthermore, after the revolution, businesses were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same applies to the army because army rankings are now based on merit rather than caste.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed members of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond this worldly life. He often used a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
He secluded himself, which lasted for a considerable time, this gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
The cave, located atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
Actually, even if someone knows of its existence, finding it is by no means easy. Once you reach the cave, you are completely alone there.
Above, there is nothing to be seen except a clear atmosphere, a beautiful sky, and the many surrounding mountains. Therefore, only a small part of the world can be seen or heard from inside this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, in the "Giza Necropolis" or the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" sign looks like a V, and the "down bow" sign looks like a staple or a square with the bottom part missing.
Forward means you should push the bow starting from the top, and backward means you should pull the bow starting from the frog (where you hold the bow with your hand).
An up-bow typically produces a soft sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to write your own markings, but remember that there are also printed bowing marks for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
A panicked King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis Charles), and the King's sister Madame Elisabeth were forced by a crowd of market women on October 6, 1789, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming and shouting crowd of people protesting against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, someone in the crowd grabbed the head of a royal bodyguard killed at Versailles and shook it in front of the terrified queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid for the US imperialist war expenses in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forcing the American street to pay taxes to the colonial regime, a large portion of which was to defraud interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by the Phil Street government through Wall Street banking houses.
Certainly, the superprofits derived from the exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic benefit of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it's essential to understand the context that inspired the order to be given.
The era in which these events occurred is generally described in European history as the High Middle Ages, spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages came after the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology-push or technological imperative, to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by scientific laws and an inherent logic tied to their manifestation in technology.
Most accounts of technological determinism revolve around two common ideas: that cultural or political influences have no impact on technological development and that technology, as a result, "impacts" societies it is embedded in rather than being socially shaped.
For example, one might say that motor cars necessarily influence the development of roads.
However, the network of roads laid across the country was not affordable for just a handful of cars, so new methods of production were developed to reduce the cost of buying a car.
The high number of car ownerships is a major cause of accidents on roads, which has fueled the invention of new technologies in healthcare to repair bodily wear and tear.
Romanticism contained a significant element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture arose that were associated with that geography. These people were far superior to arbitrarily imposed laws because society was suited to its location.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of today's world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as an epicenter of luxury from approximately 400 A.D. to 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the twelfth century mainly because Crusaders brought gifts like silk and spices that were more valuable than what Byzantine markets offered.
This was the time when Paris was given the title of fashion capital, replacing Constantinople.
The Gothic style was at its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, the attire was significantly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
Due to slow communication channels, the Western lifestyle may regress by 25-30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. As a result of the Crusades, one of the biggest developments of that time was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is practiced only to meet the needs of the farmer and his family and to produce enough food.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses saved seeds from the local geographical area, crop rotation, or other relatively simple techniques to maximize crop yield.
Historically, most farmers have practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
A subculture brings together like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ based on the age, race, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be things like language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of many factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a specific and symbolic use of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and particular slang.
Some of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization involve drawing upon the unfortunate cases of children who, while growing up, were subjected to neglect, misfortune, or abuse, if not neglect, by adults.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children are isolated from the world by people (mostly their parents). In some cases, parents do this because of a mental or physical deficiency in the children.
It is possible that the captive children faced severe child abuse or trauma before being released or escaping.
Others were reportedly brought in by animals; some are said to have been living in the forest on their own.
After being raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children behave (within physical limitations) almost identically to specially-cared-for animals, exhibiting traits such as fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather it is helpful for people who are learning something new, such as running a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual as well as real; in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold, but so is the Microsoft Office Clippy.
Virtual scaffolds are an intrinsic part of the software and they question, indicate, and provide information about processes that would be challenging for a student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for many reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they are.
We consider the foster care system a safe haven for these children.
Our system provides secure housing, loving care, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is meant to meet all the needs that were not being met in the home from which they were taken.
The internet blends elements of both people and interpersonal communication.
The distinct features of the internet lead to additional dimensions in the context of the uses and gratifications perspective.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been cited as important reasons for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
When Aimée and McCord (1998) examined audience responses on websites, "personal engagement" and "ongoing relationship" were also identified as new aspects that inspired motivation.
The use of video recordings to interpret micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds, has led to significant discoveries.
Specifically, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting a person's micro-expressions, one can understand whether or not they are lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper "The President's Speech," indicated how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess honesty.
They also suggest that the ability to interpret human behavior can be shared even by animals like domesticated dogs.
Twentieth-century research has revealed that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination of variation shuttle back and forth between two pools with each generation.
In the savanna, the available plants might be insufficient to meet the amino-acid requirements of primates with human-like digestive systems.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
Among the resources most easily obtained from plants are the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are difficult to digest without cooking.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
We shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" to some extent in much the same way that chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of waking you up during your normal sleep period, and it goes away after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to gently bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm in your sleep, keep it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other Bio-Rad-based options include drinking plenty of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, a common diuretic), which forces the person to urinate.
The more inner peace a person has, the less tension they hold in their body and mind.
The less you worry, the more positive life energy flows. Everyone can achieve ultimate peace and contentment.
Anyone can attain knowledge. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been enhanced by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In theory, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It involves Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path of embracing everyone with love.
Kundalini energy (energy of awareness) is awakened through Kundalini Yoga by using yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
Deity Yoga is central to Tibetan meditation. Clearing energy channels, activating chakras, and building enlightenment consciousness are achieved through visualizing different deities.
Spearheaded by cooperation between the USSR and the USA, Germany was a common enemy in World War II. As the war ended, the countries began to break apart due to clashes in systems, processes, and culture.
In the last two years of the war, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It was meant to run for the next 40 years, and it was really supposed to happen on battlefields from Africa to Asia, by proxy armies, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had almost collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and then unite with the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, these plans were drawn up almost overnight after over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered Poland's eastern territories, attacking and establishing Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts. They did this in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transporting goods is a highly effective way to move large quantities of people and goods from one end of the seas to the other.
Navies traditionally function to maintain the ability to transfer their country's people and goods from one place to another, while also interfering with the enemy nation's ability to transfer its people and goods.
The most notable recent example of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, where the Americans were trying to move troops and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was primarily trying to stop this traffic by using U-boats.
If the Allied nations had failed, Germany would probably have defeated Britain because it had the rest of Europe at its disposal.
Goat herding is believed to have originated 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep milk, hair, meat, and leather within easy reach.
Domestic goats were typically kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds, similar to the more widely known shepherd, who often looked after kids or juveniles. These herding methods are still used today.
Wainwrights were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although wagonways typically had uniform wooden planks, horses could pull them at a fast pace and carry larger loads on the somewhat poor roads of those days.
Crossties were put into practice quite early on to keep the tracks in place. But gradually it was realized that if the tracks had iron plates on top, they would be more efficient.
This became common, but iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of vehicles.
Ultimately, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels. In 1767, rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, with humans beginning to walk two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been able to walk on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more harmoniously with the environment by joining environmental movements, and we can even become environmental activists to save the future from some suffering.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't just want temporary solutions, we need to find the root cause of the problems and neutralize them.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological advancements of humankind, and that problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of humanity.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft was signed by John Hancock, President of the Congress, and Charles Thomson, the Secretary, then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
Between 150 and 200 copies were produced at night, which are now known as "Dunlap Broadsides."
The first public reading of the document by John Nixon was done on July 8th at Independence Hall's yard.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his army in New York on July 9th. A copy of it reached London on August 10th.
The existing 25 Dunlop Broadsides are documents of the oldest surviving copies. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists still believe today that a group of dinosaurs survived extinction and are still alive today; we call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because of their wings and ability to fly.
But there are many things about those birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
All computers used today are based on the manipulation of information coded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits in computer terminology.
Internal toxicity is not immediately apparent. Its symptoms are common, such as vomiting, which is why it cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of open containers of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Refer to the label for specific first-aid instructions regarding that particular poison.
The term "bug" is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
This definition stems from the age-old analogy of bedbugs, the most optimally adapted insects dependent on humans.
Both parasitic insects and bedbugs are nidicolous, meaning they can live comfortably in nests or the homes of hosts.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS, a disease, affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that it is absolutely not in their or their child's best interest to have another child.
These couples can choose the option of planning for adoption for their child.
In the adoption process, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's guardians.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, most scientific research is based on this method.
Although it is not the only thing, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more potential hypotheses, question, and even observation guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and particularly on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas are accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
It has been observed in many people that the presence of endogenous cycles in physiology and behavior often depends on biological clocks and their functioning.
Such periodic rhythms that are not merely responses to external periodic cues have been recorded for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that will maintain a free-running cycle for a period even in the absence of external cues.
A key implication of the Hershey and Chase experiment was that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, one by labeling the DNA with radioactive phosphorus in a bacteriophage and the other by labeling the bacteriophage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations have varying effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ-line cells.
Only growth in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while growth elsewhere can lead to cell destruction or cancer.
Nature-based tourism aims to attract people interested in experiencing natural landscapes, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
Going to Borneo, doing photography, and learning about orangutans is an example.
They leave small towns in their cars to go to work and the workplace they just left is taken over by others.
Everyone is connected in some way within this dynamic transportation shuttle, and it supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this vast carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has aided human development over the past two million years.
Everyone is connected to society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
You rarely hear complaints about similar levels of water quality or collapsing bridges in developed countries.
Why does the transportation system encourage such complaints? Why are they lagging behind every day? Are the transport engineers not competent? Or is there some other major flaw in the system?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty beforehand.
Fortunately, drivers operate within a reasonably consistent range; thus, there's some reasonable stability in the traffic stream, and it can be roughly demonstrated mathematically.
To better illustrate traffic flow, a correlation has been established between three key features: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relations help in the planning, designing, and operations of roadway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and also find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from being able to fold their wings back over their body.
This gives them a vast network of small spaces to hide from predators.
Currently, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus stated that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the Earth.
That seems logical, since it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It holds more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes becoming as wide as six miles.
20% of the water that flows from our planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It is joined by thousands of smaller rivers.
However, the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, never surpassing the size of the pyramids of Giza or the technical brilliance of their construction.
The people of the New Kingdom in ancient Egypt were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of approximately 800. It is the smallest independent nation in the world with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legal and official communications.
Italian is also a language used daily by most people working in the state, while Latin is used in religious rituals.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Since ancient times, people have only known about chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper because they can be found in their native form in nature and are relatively easy to find using rudimentary tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proved that everything is made of a mixture of one or four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was mostly similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although they also theorized that what we see transforms into even newer substances.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also take alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
All objects in the universe are made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called molecules.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit within the period at the end of a sentence.
Thus, when the pencil arrived, it was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods have developed, the status and use of pencils have diminished.
People now type messages on computer screens; there's no need to use a sharpener.
No one can imagine what the keyboard will become with the arrival of something new.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to hold a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
Like a heavy vehicle being rolled and hauled up a mountain. To divide the nucleus again and extract some energy from it.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they have a tendency to break apart with little or no provocation.
The moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick at the near end and 100 kilometers thick at the far end.
It is thinner under the ocean and thicker under higher altitudes.
Because the crust was thin, there would be many maria nearby. It was easy for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory focuses on discovering what motivates or attracts people.
These principles suggest that people had certain needs and/or desires that became ingrained within them as they matured into adulthood.
These theories examine what aspects about certain individuals compel them to do the things they desire, and what aspects of their environment encourage or discourage them from doing certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In simple terms, two kinds of behavior emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
Such a manager struggles to make decisions that differ from everyone's thinking, take disciplinary action, inspect work, delegate responsibility, and fix people's accountability.
On the other end of the spectrum, you have someone who takes on the persona of an unfamiliar person who feels they need to change everything on the team and mold it to their liking.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of their team.
This behavior can sometimes create rifts between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as points of contact for their immediate physical group.
They have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which might not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The Invisible Team is the management team to which each member reports. The Invisible Team sets the standards for each member.
Why would any organization want to adopt the time-consuming process of establishing a training organization? One purpose of putting the organizational training concept into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across an organization's functional departments, both creativity and innovation become possible.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can be an innovative process for meeting customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must foster a culture of innovation, as well as cultivate shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explained the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach higher levels of functioning.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to investigating cognition. Therefore, it narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
Scientists support research into the relationship between brain disorders and behavior.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain lesions, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect certain mental behaviors and cause changes in some mental functions.

This provides a lot of information and material for building a simulation model, which helps us understand the processes of our minds.
Although AI has a strong presence in science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, machine learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, customer diagnosis and answering questions, as well as handwritten recognition, speech, and faces.
Such things have become distinct disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
These days, AI systems are frequently used in fields like economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being built into many home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom. Teachers will often want to take their students to places where bus trips are not an option.
Technology also offers some recourse with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art together in their classroom.
Actually, sharing field trips is a great way to reflect on the journey and experience it with future classes.
For example, thousands of students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state's capital. The website is redesigned every year, but some older versions are kept online to be used as scrapbooks.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. While students often start their blogging experience with haphazard grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally leads to improvement.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to try to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism or reviews.
Furthermore, blogging "forces students to be more informed about the world around them." The need to satisfy audience interest motivates students to be agile and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn better than in a traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet content, students can define their own positions in relation to the writing of others, as well as put their own perspective on a particular topic online (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and features numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
There is a Niagara Falls in the far south. Additionally, natural beauty abounds in the north in places like Muskoka and elsewhere.
All of these things make Ontario even more important because foreigners completely consider themselves Canadian.
The northern part of the region is very sparsely populated, and some areas have almost no human population.
For a population comparison that may surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
East African islands lie in the Indian Ocean, beyond the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island continent with its own unique wildlife.
Most small islands are independent nations, or belong to France and are known for luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to this land and spread it extensively in Comoros and Mayotte.
The 15th century saw the beginning of European influence and colonialism, as Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
In the north, this region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler, regardless of their actual marital status, state that they are married.
This is also a useful ring to wear (not just to look very expensive).
Women should understand that due to cultural differences, they may face harassment, and it is possible that they are followed or someone might forcibly grab their arm, etc.
Firmly reject men and stand your ground without hesitation (the existence or non-existence of cultural differences does not make this right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, then abandoned it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar al-Baida, and Spanish merchants named it Casablanca, establishing trading centers there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of gewgaws, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located directly east of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the central part.
Although Goma itself is reasonably safe, one should be aware of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province when venturing outside of Goma.
This city is a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo as well as offering some of the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. A short ride typically costs around 500 Congolese francs (local fare).
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for a faraway land.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sand.
This was a major stop on Henry Louis Gates' PBS journey into Africa.
This city is different from the rest of the country's cities because it looks like an Arab city rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
This park spans 19,500 square kilometers and contains 14 distinct eco-zones, each with its own unique wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
All South African national parks, including this park, charge daily conservation and entrance fees.
Buying a Wild Card can also be beneficial because it allows you to visit select parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong territory its name and is considered the main focal point by many tourists.
The parade of buildings that has made Hong Kong's skyline resemble a shimmering bar chart has made the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters worth seeing.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated along the northern coast, largely on reclaimed land.
This is the place where the British colonialists made their own, and therefore if you are looking for evidence of this place's colonial past, this is a good place to be.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into Bangladeshi and Indian hilly regions.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The portion of the forest that lies within India is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they are among the last remaining powerful forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans spans 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is water/swampy area.
Since 1966, it has been the Sundarban Wildlife Sanctuary, and according to one estimate, the area now has approximately 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer (chital).
Buses operate throughout the day from the inter-district bus station (which is across the river), although most buses, especially those heading towards the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30 in the morning.
Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
In most districts, small Japanese coaster buses operate, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to get to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana, across the Oyapock River.
The height of these two towers is 83 meters. Their length is 378 meters, and they have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are also expected to be dismantled.
The Guaraní were the most prominent group of indigenous people living in eastern Paraguay. They lead a nomadic life and also cultivate crops for their sustenance.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guayacuro and the Pegua, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish people initiated the colonial period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having the best polo team and players in the world.
The year's biggest tournament takes place in December at the Las Canitas polo grounds.
Small tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and to purchase tickets for polo matches, visit Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP) at par.
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on these islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West Store.
British Pounds are generally accepted anywhere in the islands and in Stanley for credit cards, and United States Dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted on the outer islands, although British and United States currency will be; check with the owners beforehand to determine what payment methods are acceptable.
Exchanging Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands is nearly impossible, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it experiences summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, it is common to have temperatures exceeding +30°C.
Winter weather can be deceptively cold: the temperature may rarely be freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity can make it feel colder than what the thermometer reads.
Here, there is no "rainy" or "dry" season: the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although there are many animals in the park for humans to see, wildlife is still ferocious and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards/meters away from other wild animals.
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and just about any animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so keep your distance from them.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s, and it has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, this port was the site of a notorious naval standoff when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave it.
Apart from one British cruiser, all the ships sank. About 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the struggle for independence led by the Mau movement, the prominent Tāmua Tamesese Lealofi III was assassinated at a peaceful gathering in the city.
Due to Auckland sprawling across two harbors, it has many beaches. The most popular beaches are in three main areas.
The northern coastline (in the North Harbour district) is in the Pacific Ocean, extending from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
These are mostly sandy beaches where swimming is considered safe. Most of them are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive is located on the Waitemata Harbour waterfront, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good range of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One'; it's not a complex beer, but it is refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
We have a variety of French wines here, but perhaps New Zealand and Australian wines would be better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you're concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A 'short black' is an 'espresso', a cappuccino is filled with cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is made to Belgian standards. The fruit juice is expensive but very good.
Reef trips happen frequently throughout the year, and these rarely cause any damage to the reef.
Still consult with the authorities, follow all signage, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and in estuaries north of 1770 from October to April. During these months, they can often be found offshore as well.
Sharks do exist, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not typically live in the open ocean. They can often be seen in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind, knowing that at least after reaching their destination, they will have a place to rest.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although you can also book other accommodation options like camping grounds through a travel agent.
Typically, travel agents offer packages that include hotel costs along with breakfast, airport transfers, or airfare.
They can also offer you a reservation facility if you want time to think about the offer or to obtain documents (like a visa) for the destination.
Any amendments or requests, however, should be made through the travel agent first, rather than directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most people attending music festivals decide to camp at the venue itself, and most consider it a crucial part of their experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to get to the campsite near the music as quickly as possible.
Remember that even after the music stops on the main stage, there will be parts of the festival that continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, you need to check cabin space, because those who are most affected will experience a fairly terrifying noise when passing through the ice.
A St. Petersburg port visit includes spending time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos typically make many efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. This usually includes having no windows or clocks, and the way out can be quite difficult to find.
They usually arrange for special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep their guests in a good mood and make them want to stay.
Some places serve alcoholic beverages; however, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should keep in mind the possibility of snow, ice, or cold temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there's less friction, and you won't be able to drive as you would on just asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow to trap you can fall in a very short amount of time.
Visibility can also be reduced by snowfall or condensation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic generally flows smoothly throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attractions in Africa, and they draw many visitors.
The term "safari" is typically used to refer to a comprehensive viewing of the magnificent African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, come very close to the cars, and the standard equipment will provide a good view.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy. You will be able to see them well through binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or simply "walking") involves hiking for a few days or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24, 2021 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the games in 1964, will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the moratorium was announced, this could be a difficult situation for you.
Cancellation policies may vary, but most cancellation policies based on the coronavirus at the end of March are not extended to July 2020, which is when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will be priced between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Damp clothes can be ironed to dry them. Many hotels offer irons and ironing boards on loan, even if these items aren't in the room.
If a press is unavailable, or if you don't want to wear pressed socks, you can consider using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful not to let the iron get too hot, as this could cause shrinkage, or if it gets very hot, it could burn the fabric.
There are many ways to purify water, some of which are effective in reducing specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others, boiling for several minutes is necessary.
Filter effectiveness varies, and you should consider that first; then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers encounter animals and insects with which they are unfamiliar in their home region.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in worse cases, trigger allergies, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Contagious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Tourists living in countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway between Point Marion and Fairmont presents some of the most challenging driving conditions, with the road often winding through desolate forest.
If you're not used to driving on the country's roads, keep this information with you: steep grades, narrow lanes, and dangerous turns.
The speed limits that have been issued are significantly lower than before – typically 35-40 miles per hour (56-60 km/h) – and strict enforcement is essential.
Interestingly, mobile phone service is better here compared to many other parts of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and diverse, similar to its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apple pastries baked year-round, and cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many German baked goods include almonds, walnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often taste especially good with a strong coffee.
If you want some small but nutritious pastries, you can try Berliner, pancakes, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made with meat or vegetables combined with herbs and spices.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on its liquidity.
In North India and the inland regions of Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is typically used.
Of the total 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a broad term, encompassing the diverse range of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without additional qualifiers, the word refers to food that originates from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago, featuring traditional dishes, with the dominant flavors in Javanese food being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various fragrant spices.
Stirrups are supports for a rider's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They offer the driver more stability, but there may be safety concerns due to the possibility of a driver's feet getting trapped in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, the rider can be dragged if the horse runs away. Several safety measures can be taken to reduce this risk.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly thin sole.
Following this, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars from which the stirrup leather falls away from the saddle if a falling rider pulls backwards on it.
Cochamó Valley is a renowned climbing destination in Chile, also known as the Yosemite of South America, featuring towering cliffs and diverse granite walls.
The peaks offer breathtaking views from their summits. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly forging new routes through the endless possibilities of its faces.
Snow sports on mountain slopes, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving gliding over snow-covered areas on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums," who plan entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depict skiers dating back to 5000 BC.
Downhill skiing as a sport originated at least as early as the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia in 1861 by Norwegians.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related, but generally does not involve alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, which is done in steep terrain and requires very stiff skis and boots.
Think of a skiing trail as you would a hiking trail.
You'll be able to cover somewhat more ground walking in good conditions - but only cross-country skiing, unencumbered by heavy bags on prepared tracks, will give you real speed.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but it contains many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to multiple countries means going through the visa application and passport control process multiple times.
However, the Schengen Zone functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you live in this area, you can usually cross borders without ever going through passport control checkpoints.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for separate visas for Schengen member countries, saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no global definition for when manufactured goods become antiques. Some tax agencies define items older than 100 years as antiques.
There are geographical differences in the definition, where the age limit would be lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handmade products can be defined as antiques, even though they are less old compared to mass-produced goods.
Barasingha farming is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture surrounding this trade is also important for other businesses.
Traditionally, however, not all Sami are involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather make a living from fishing, hunting, and the like, keeping reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi work in modern trades, and tourism is a very important source of income in Sápmi, which is inhabited by the Sámi people.
Although it is widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Romani people.
If the country you are traveling to is subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
Besides your own government, you can seek advice from the governments of other countries. However, their advice is given keeping their own citizens in mind.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or people of Arab descent.
An advisory is merely a brief overview of the political situation in any country.
The perspectives shown are often superficial, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any dangerous meteorological phenomena with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.

Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to be able to go through scanners while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are flows of water rushing back out to sea, often occurring near a pier or similar structure.
Due to the underwater topology, return flow concentrates in some deeper sections, and from here, there can be a rapid flow into deeper water.
Most deaths are due to exhaustion from swimming against the current, which may even be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back isn't particularly difficult.
Move to a location where you won't get trapped again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've attracted attention, you might want to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock comes sooner than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more intense.
Those travelers who had a good opportunity to adjust to a new culture sometimes have an especially difficult time readjusting to their original culture.
Having lived abroad, when you return home, you've adopted a new culture and lost many habits of your own domestic culture.
When you traveled abroad in the past, people were more patient and understanding, knowing that travelers needed time to adjust to a new country and its ways.
People cannot guess that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the children's area.
You can quietly see the pyramid in the dark before the show begins.

Here, the peninsular mountains merge into a plateau, then rising again, they form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, contains Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, and Mount Vinson, whose highest peak is 4892 meters.
In remote locations, where there is no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
Satellite phones generally can't be used in place of mobile phones because you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to a satellite in order to make a call with a satellite phone.
This service is typically used by shipping companies, including those with smaller, navigable vessels, as well as operations that require remote data and voice services.
Please note that your local telephone service provider can provide more information about connecting to this service.
For those planning a gap year, traveling and learning is a more popular option.
This is particularly popular with school leavers, allowing them to get out a year before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year course abroad can actually increase your chances of getting into a higher education course in your home country.
Generally, you will have to pay tuition fees to enroll in these academic programs.
Finland is a great place for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, located in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in island groups and lakes.
While the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or kayaks offer a different kind of experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands this figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can travel to the historical city for a few days and sleep on the ship at night on your way back.
You will not need a separate visa if you only go ashore using shipboard excursions (as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures include Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and the cruise price does not include a trip to the city.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience during a flight.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears or dislikes that everyone can have.
For some, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help alleviate a fear that is based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Courier companies are paid to deliver goods quickly and efficiently. Often, they play a very important role in the timely delivery of business documents, merchandise, or spare parts used for repairs.
On select routes, large companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and for smaller firms, this is a problem.
If they ship things via air freight, it could take a few days for unloading and customs on some routes.
The only way to get it quickly was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations wouldn't allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
Traveling in first or business class is about spending more money for comfort (or, better yet, having your company book it for you).

The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the declaration of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any member state of the United Nations.
Despite the political deadlock, economic partnership has been re-established in these two regions of Moldova.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million. It is also the second largest port after Istanbul and a very important transportation hub.

Plitvice National Park is surrounded by dense forest, mainly consisting of beech, spruce, and fir trees, and where alpine and Mediterranean vegetation meet.
It has extensive vegetation diversity due to its range of microclimatic zones, varied soils, and different altitude levels.
