And this doesn't just confirm that dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but it also provides detailed specifics that studies can't uncover, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top with an underbelly tending towards yellow.
The discovery also provides insight into the development of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers didn't have a well-developed central shaft, called a rachis, but they did have other feather features - barbs and barbules - researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a gradual development that came later than these other features.
Bashir emphasized that the feathers weren't used for flight but for regulating temperature or for display. The researchers suggested that, despite it being a small tail, the sample shows the feathers of a chicken and not a chick.
The researchers suggested that although this is a small tail, the sample shows the feathers of an adult bird, not a chick.

The effect the team was looking for resulted from tidal forces between dark matter in galaxies in general and dark matter in the Milky Way galaxy in particular.
Just as the moon affects the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way galaxy also affects the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to deduce that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter affects it.
This theory considers that most of the dark matter surrounding the galaxy is in the shape of a halo, and consists of several small particles.

Candidates can send representatives to attend every part of the process. Also, vote counting is done by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Her first race was a slalom race, in which she won a "Did Not Finish" award in her first round. 36 out of 116 competitors got the same result in that race.
In her second race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting category with a combined time of 4:41.30 minutes, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who took first place, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary, who finished ninth.
Four female skiers in the sitting group failed to finish their runs, and 45 out of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to achieve top ranks in the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen computer and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General Dr. K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants are Baba Kanjar, Butha Kanjar, Rambro Kanjar, Ghaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Despite there being three people in the house, he was hit by a car, but none of them were hurt.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened has been temporarily closed so that emergency services could extract the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekuoya was accused in Edinburgh Sheriff Court of murdering her son.
She is detained awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be compromised because her picture has been widely circulated.
While it's a widespread practice in other parts of the UK, Scottish justice operates differently, and the courts have considered that publishing images could be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee points out, "It seems that journalists are treading a dangerous line if they publish photos and other things of suspects."
The public prosecution responsible for the prosecutions clarified to journalists that no further comment will be made until the indictment is issued at least.
According to leaks, the document will refer to the border dispute that Palestine wants based on the pre-1967 war borders.
Among the other topics that were covered, according to reports, were the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel is demanding a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority is agreeing to allow this presence for only five years.
Forest rangers overseeing the supplemental pest control experiment had to closely supervise the spraying workers while monitoring the experiment and evaluating its effectiveness.
Through a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been appointed to the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the manager in charge of park and heritage conservation with NPWS, the four shooters who were selected for the initial shooting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before a new, temporary nine-member electoral council.
This is Martelly's fifth interim electoral council in four years.
A presidential committee recommended last month the resignation of the former electoral congress party as part of a set of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee's response was a reaction to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Violent protests erupted at times due to the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating have been reported in defective iPods, which caused a total of six fires and resulted in minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry stated that it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced last week that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded to Apple's request to postpone the report by calling it "very unfortunate."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT) on Friday.
The emergency management office in the Northern Marianas said that damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there are no tsunami indications.
A former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza aimed his M16 rifle at the tourists.
A number of hostages have been rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages have been released, including children, elderly people, and also the Filipino photographers.
They took the photographers to an old lady's place because she needed to go to the bathroom, after Mendoza was shot.
Misha followed in his father's footsteps and worked in the medical profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When Lygnaz was working at the hospital, he started exploring premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that giving a happiness hormone accelerates fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found the "black boxes" from the flight recorder on Wednesday.
The fellow wrestlers also expressed their appreciation for Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of wrestling and my first manager. And she died on a night when two moons appeared, a unique night just like her. Luna was a strong lady."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented and said, "Luna was as scary as me...and maybe even more...I love her and I'll miss her...I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by eight percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the survey participants share the same opinion, they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the most advanced stages of the survey, 29 percent of those who participated in the survey believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The winner of the Olympic gold medal was supposed to swim in two races, the 100m and 200m freestyle, and three races in the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaint, his fitness became questionable.
Since he wasn't taking the necessary medication to cope with his pain, they were prevented from participating in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different devices and software starting in February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source for delivering water to Earth, along with organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since the time comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Come on, the 53-year-old who took office as governor this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of liters of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses a technology that relies on satellites instead of the old ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no additional transport added, and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley. Also, parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on site.
Concerns about the lack of transportation have raised the possibility of being forced to play the match behind closed doors, without the team's fans.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved in just two generations, even though it is estimated that this process usually takes much longer, due to interbreeding between a native Darwin's finch and an immigrant cactus finch.
Gold can be crafted into all shapes and forms. It can be transformed into smaller shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and spun. It can be hammered or rolled to become sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This indicator is called the pH, and it's symbolized as pH. You can also make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the quantity of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the dry ingredients together, then squeeze with clean, damp hands into the shape of balls.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will make you feel ticklish and form a sort of crust.
Every house in Araba and Mohenjo-daro was equipped with water cycles connected to an advanced sewage system.
They found remnants of sewage systems in the houses of the cities of Minoan Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There used to be bathrooms in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, bathrooms were sometimes part of public baths, and men's and women's bathrooms were sometimes mixed together.
When you talk to someone thousands of miles away from you, you are using a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then reflects it again, almost immediately.
They sent the satellite into space using a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and visibility.
It requires a giant rocket with a height exceeding 100 feet to put a satellite or telescope into space.
And the wheel managed to change the world in an unbelievable way. And the most important thing the wheel provided us with is providing an easier and faster means of transportation.
She brought us the train, the car, and several other means of transportation.
And beneath them, there are moderately sized lynxes that prey on medium-sized game, ranging from rabbits to gazelles and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats) that eat the more numerous smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a suitable environment, and a specific job for each cat that prevents it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social of the cat family, and they live in large groups called prides.
The groups consist of one to three adult males, in addition to approximately thirty females and cubs.
Females usually have a close bond with each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion pride lives similarly to wolf or dog packs, which are animals that behave a lot like lions (but not other big cats), and are very fierce towards their prey.
It's like a complete athlete, the tiger can climb (even if not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times more strength than a human.
The tiger is considered to be from the same group (tiger family) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. And these four cats are the only ones that can roar.
And of course, a tiger's roar isn't like a lion's roar. Rather, it's more like a series of screams.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals. It hunts monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if it can. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track animals to eat them (prey) by smelling and sniffing out their location on the ground.
The wildcat can see well in the dark and move silently. It hunts its prey by blending in with its surroundings.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they came from (like if they moved across a mountain range or a river, or if they moved to a new island so that they can't easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they were in before.
The new environment contains different resources and different competitors, so the new inhabitants will need different features or adaptations to be strong competitors, unlike what they were before.
The original inhabitants never changed, and they still need the same adjustments as they did before.
Over time, as the new residents begin to adapt to their new environment, they start to appear less like the other residents.
Ultimately, after thousands or even millions of years, the two communities will be so different that we won't be able to call them the same species.
We call this process diversification, because it creates new types. And it's an important and necessary process for evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and take the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. In addition, they provide oxygen.
We build our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, and all our food is from plants. But we don't think that without plants, animals wouldn't be able to live.
The mosasaurus was the strongest predator of its time, that's why it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Her elongated jaws are lined with over 70 pointed teeth, in addition to an extra set on the roof of her mouth, which means there's no escape for anything that crosses her path.
We don't know exactly, but most likely she had a forked tongue. She used to eat snakes, big fish, and other animals, and maybe even used to eat humans.
She also attacked everything that came her way in the water. Even the giant dinosaur like T. rex is no match for her.
Despite the fact that most Roman food might not be foreign to us, they have unusual and extraordinary dishes for the holidays, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
The second difference was that while the poor and women were eating their food sitting on chairs, the rich men preferred to hold feasts together, reclining comfortably on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and the ancient Romans never tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered a home for the god.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to meet the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard, followed by an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Special pyramid-shaped towers were built, sometimes called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a private sanctuary for the lord.
With the warm Middle Eastern climate, a house wasn't very important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The women used to cook in the courtyard; and the shops were just open spaces overlooking the road, and the houses were built using stone.
There weren't large forests in the land of Canaan, so the price of wood was expensive.
Greenland was settled separately. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living here at that time.
Even though Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were all "Scandinavian" countries, there are still many differences between their people, kings, history, and traditional clothing.
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
This isn't true, despite there being something written on the back of the ad, it's not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence is "Original Declaration of Independence dated June 4, 1776." And the text appears inverted at the bottom of the page.
Even though no one knows exactly who wrote the Great Parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches × 24½ inches), it is known that it was bound from its first edition for storage.
That's why it's likely the symbols were simply added as a mark.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the French "Vichy" regime. Those are the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France and called the invasion "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces liberated southern France and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization is an individual culture shared among a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word "civilization" derives from the Latin word "civilis," which means "civil" and is related to the Latin word "civis," which in turn means "citizen." The word "civitas" means city or city-state, and this somehow defines the size of the society.
These city-states are the ancestors of nations. Civilizational culture inspires the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, and a lasting cultural imprint and fair dissemination.
Often, subcultures begin to disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
In the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen Colonies formed, for the first time, a weak central government - with Congress as its sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and due to the absence of a national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the authority of the states, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
She also didn't have the authority to override tax and tariff laws between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all states before they could be amended, but these states greatly undermined the central government to the point that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is considered the second most successful team in the world, and they were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions because Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan comprises approximately 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes it the seventh-largest island country in the world!
Due to the group of islands existing in Japan, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective.
The city of Taiwan began in the 15th century, and European sailors gave the island the name Ilha Formosa, or "Beautiful Island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began shifting the production of native grains, employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) seized the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings located on the outskirts of the complex were rebuilt so that tourists would get a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration process continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format for still photos in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size by the end of the analog film era.
They're still producing it to this day, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
A 35mm design is actually a bit confusing, so it's preferable that it be 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The ratio of the sides of this shape (divided by the greatest common factor to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
A large number of common formats (for example, the Advanced Image Coding format) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often misused and mocked, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining some order in the image.
You're saying that the most effective spot for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three sections vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was subjected to intense scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has connected European countries despite their differences in language and customs.
Her overwhelming power affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the core principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the Church's monetary funds exist specifically for this reason.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the Church was in Rome, and this focus on authority and money led many people to question whether this doctrine was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved its effectiveness by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this siege violated generally accepted international law enshrined in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from floating onto entire sections of the ocean, which posed a danger even to neutral ships.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar reaction to unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and countries were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war in World War I, countries wanted to avoid such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of denoting different time periods; each stage of China or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty, there was an unstable era for the divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
In these periods, a fierce war broke out between several nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying due to the struggle for the highest seat in the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political impacts, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from tyranny to republic, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the revolution, professions were open to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and successful among them to succeed.
The same thing applies to the army because instead of the army's rankings being based on rank, they now depend on mental capacity.
The French Revolution also inspired several oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammad was very interested in matters that transcended this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave known as "Hira" on Mount Nur for contemplation.
The same cave that has remained throughout history gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
The cave is located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find him at all, even if the person knows he exists. Once he enters the cave, he becomes completely isolated.
It's impossible to see anything but the clear, beautiful sky above you and a few surrounding mountains. Very few in this world get to see or hear from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, which the Egyptians built in the 3rd century BC, is one of several large pyramidal structures that were built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains many pyramids, the largest of which is the Great Pyramid, as well as several smaller tombs and many temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" symbol takes the shape of a V, and the "down bow" symbol takes the shape of a square without its bottom side.
The word "Up" means that you have to tighten the bow and put pressure on it, and the word "Down" means that you have to start from where you placed your hand on the bow and pull it outwards.
Typically, the upper bout creates a softer sound, while the lower bout is more powerful and firm.
Don't hesitate to lightly mark your notes with a pencil, but remember that the printed articulation markings are there for a musical reason, and you should generally respect them.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their young children Marie Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged four, and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced, terrified, to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
They traveled in a carriage, returning to Paris amidst a very large number of people who were shouting and chanting against the King and Queen.
The mob forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At one point, a member of the gang smashed the head of a royal guard who was killed in Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
And the Filipino people paid the costs of the American imperialist war by the occupation of the Philippines.
They were then forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to bear a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds that were floated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
And surely, the immense profits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people will constitute the primary gains for American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, you need to understand the reason that led to their creation.
The time when these events occurred is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages for the European historical period, specifically the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, generally considered to end around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas, in practice, from the impetus of technology or technological determinism to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path that transcends cultural or political influence, and that this technology has inherent "effects" on societies, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, a person might say that cars necessarily lead to road development.
The national road network is not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Collective car ownership also leads to a higher rate of road accidents, which in turn leads to the innovation of new technologies in the field of healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, drawing from writers like Goethe and Fichte.
In the context of romance, geography shaped the people, and with time, customs and a culture related to this geography emerged, and this was more harmonious with the status of the community than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame began as a center for prosperity around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 13th century mainly because of the Crusaders returning with gifts like silk and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.
During this time, the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the Levant.
Due to the slow communication channels, Western lifestyles may be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
With the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at that time was buttons, which people started using to fasten their clothes and which were a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is the type of agriculture that is done to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, and often very organic, that uses heirloom seeds preserved locally alongside each other with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar mindsets who feel neglected by societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of belonging.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a distinct subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture always refer to their membership using a distinct and symbolic style, which includes specific patterns, behaviors, and language.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is relying on a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Some children are labeled as "feral," and this classification stems from many people (often their own parents). In some cases, this ferality arises in children who are rejected by their parents due to significant mental or physical deficiencies in the child.
It's possible that feral children experienced child abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or running away.
It is claimed that some were raised with animals; it is said that some lived in the wilderness alone.
When a child is raised with non-human animals, they start to make movements (within physical limits) that closely resemble the animals' movements, such as fear of humans or indifference towards them.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and simpler, the scaffolding method goes further than that.
Progressive educational technologies are not a learning method but a supportive tool that provides assistance to individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Progressive educational technologies can be virtual and real, meaning the professor is a form of progressive educational technology, and also the assistant on Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds have been integrated to assist with posing questions and explaining procedures that the student might not be able to solve alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that lacks nurturing, care, and upbringing, but that's what's happening.
And we are convinced that the nursery system is a safe space for the children.
The foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes and compassionate people who offer stable care, education, and reliable healthcare.
The foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that weren't available in the home he/she was taken from previously.
The internet combines elements of mass and personal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and gratifications approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been described as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal Involvement" and "Ongoing Relationships" were identified as new motivating aspects by Amy and McCord (1998) when they conducted research on public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has enabled important discoveries in interpreting subtle expressions and facial movements that last for only a few fractions of a second.
Specifically, they say that a person can discover if someone is lying by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks explained how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggested that capabilities like these in explaining human behavior might be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variations: hidden and apparent.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of observable variation.
Recombination shuffles variation back and forth between the two populations each generation.
In the savannas, it's difficult for primates with digestive systems like humans to meet their amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Failure to do so also has dire consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant-based resources were the proteins you could get from leafy greens and legumes, but they are difficult for humans to digest if they aren't cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the "early protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep Interruption is when you wake up intentionally during your regular sleep period and then go back to sleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
And this can be easily achieved by using a relatively gentle alarm so you regain consciousness without fully waking up.
If you find yourself readjusting the alarm while you're still asleep, you can put it on the other side of the room; this will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biological systems include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces the person to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of stress in their body and soul.
The more the tension decreases, the more positive the life force becomes, and everyone has the ability to find ultimate peace and contentment.
Everyone can become cultured. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded through the Mahayana path of love and several techniques from Indian yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path of universal love.
With Kundalini yoga, you gain Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, and visualizations.
The Tibetan Meditation Center is Deity Yoga. Through visualizing different deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened awareness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. With the end of the war, clashes of system, operation, and culture led to the fall of states.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became today's enemies, and that's how the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last 40 years and be fought by real armies by proxy in battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Bridgehead.
These plans became outdated almost overnight, but more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is considered the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional task of naval forces was to ensure your country maintains the ability to transport its people and goods, while simultaneously interfering with your enemy's ability to transport their people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy modern examples was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop this movement primarily with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to invade Britain, just like it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes used to keep them due to the ease of access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Local goats were generally raised in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were children or teenagers, like the most famous shepherd. And these grazing methods are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Despite the carts being made of just parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to pull them to reach a greater speed and haul a larger load than on slightly rougher roads that day.
Crossties were introduced early on to secure the tracks in place. It was gradually recognized that the tracks would be more effective if they had a strip of iron on top.
This practice has become widespread, however, the iron caused increased wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
In the end, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. Humans started walking upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning the upright man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, didn't walk completely upright like they used to.
They found evidence of bipedalism in southern ape fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although it's possible that Sahelanthropus tchadensis walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in an environmentally friendly way and join the environmental movement, and we can also be activists to reduce future suffering.
And this is like treating the symptoms in many cases. But if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to solve the problem from its roots.
It's quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to human scientific and technological advancements, and the problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and humanity's wasteful lifestyle.
After its approval by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few buildings away to John Dunlap's printing press.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known today as "Dunlap Broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in Independence Hall Square on July 8th.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap stickers are still there, and they are the oldest existing copies of the document besides the original handwritten version.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many things about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computer devices used today rely on processing information encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can only contain one value out of two possible values, meaning 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits, for use in computer language.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately obvious. The symptoms, like vomiting, are very general, so an immediate diagnosis isn't always possible.
The best indicator of internal poisoning could be the presence of an open medicine box or a chemical cleaner container.
Refer to the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term is derived from the old word "bedbug," which means insects that have adapted greatly to live with humans.
Bedbugs and dust mites are cohabitating, adapted to living in or near their host's dwelling.
Across the United States, in approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), it is considered the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that females are more than twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis than males.
The couple might decide that it's not in their best interest, or in their child's best interest, to raise a child.
These couples might choose to put together an adoption plan for their children.
Through adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the other couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research.
From here alone, experimentation, and the experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, and to pose questions, and to observe, and it also leads to scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Holy Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all scientific matters, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior heavily rely on the existence of internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, some of which are simply responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to free-run even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to inject their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to find out if the DNA in the bacteria was with the radioactive phosphorus or if the bacterial protein was with the radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a diverse range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Germline mutations can be passed on to male offspring only, while mutations in other locations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of activities at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting gardens, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns in their cars to go to their workplaces, passing by people whose workplaces are in the place they just left.
With this dynamic transportation hub, everyone is somehow connected to and supported by a transportation system that relies on private cars.
The science is indicating now that this massive carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human development over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation systems. And almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
You rarely hear in developed countries similar levels of complaints regarding the quality of water or bridges that collapse.
Why do transportation systems cause so many complaints and fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something bigger happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points, and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is considered a difficult subject because we can't predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the drivers behave in the same way; therefore, the traffic flow is somewhat consistent and can be roughly estimated.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals that flew in the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wide range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people believe he was right, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
And that makes sense because we don't feel the ground moving. Right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, with more than 8 times the amount of water found in the second largest river.
The Amazon is also considered the widest river on Earth, reaching a width of six miles in some places.
20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The length of the main Amazon River is 6,387 km, which is 3980 miles, and its water is collected from thousands of small rivers.
Despite the completion of pyramid construction with stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids have never been surpassed in terms of size and artistic distinction in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were already over a thousand years old at that time.
The Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent country in the world by population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is mainly used in religious celebrations.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they can all be discovered in nature in their native form and are relatively simple to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle posited that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he assumed they transformed into new materials to form what we are seeing.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered minerals. Of course, there are other minerals like silver and gold.
You can obtain alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
And so, the pencil was a companion to many people when it first appeared.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new ways of writing, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and fewer uses.
People write letters on computer screens nowadays without needing a pencil sharpener.
One asks oneself how the keyboard will be when something new comes out.
A fission bomb works on a principle that requires energy to create a nucleus with a lot of protons and neutrons.
It's like you're dragging a heavy cart uphill, so that's why splitting the nucleus a second time releases some of this energy.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with or without a little push.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust, and the outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 kilometers thick near the close side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
He is thinner down by Maria and fatter up by the highlands.
There might be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner, and it was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that were internalized as they matured into adulthood.
It digs into these theories about the nature of some people who make them want the things they do, and what things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two prevalent content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can appear when managers start leading their former colleagues. The person from the group tries to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager faces difficulty in making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, the person transforms into someone unrecognizable and feels that they must change everything the team was doing and own it themselves.
After everything, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to problems between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, although there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate, physical team.
They often enjoy greater autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet in accordance with different time zones that their local management might not understand.
The existence of an "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team that each member reports to, and the invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why might the organization want to undertake a time-consuming process to establish an educational organization? One of the objectives of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can emerge when available resources are used effectively across organized functional departments.
As a result, the whole organization's way of working together is geared towards overcoming any obstacle that might arise in the process of creating innovative solutions to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must create a culture of innovation in addition to shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) describes the continuity approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to investigating cognition, thereby narrowing the scope of research and making it more precise.
The relationship between neuropathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain cognitive functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see, investigate, and study brain structures and processes that we haven't seen before.
This thing provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Despite the fact that artificial intelligence has strong connotations of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, in addition to handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become separate specializations, and they focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
They often use artificial intelligence systems nowadays in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military. It has also been built into several computer software applications and home video games.
Field trips are considered a big part of any classroom. Often, the teacher likes to take her students to places without the field trip bus.
With technology advancing, the solution comes through virtual field trips, allowing students to take a look at artifacts in the museum, visit the aquarium, or enjoy fine arts while they are sitting in the classroom.
Participating in a field trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned every year, while keeping the old versions online like an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogs with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience generally changes this.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts striving to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to feed public interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a way to increase collaboration and encourage students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can make students become more analytical and critical; through effective response to internet materials, students can identify their positions within the context of other people's writings and also define their own viewpoints regarding specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada, where two languages are spoken, and it includes a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is in the far south, and the north is home to the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and others shed light on Ontario, which Westerners consider quintessentially Canadian.
Vast areas in the north have low population density, and some are almost uninhabited.
To compare population sizes, this surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and it's practically its own continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent states or associated with France, and are known for being luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country, and it largely took over the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
The area is bordered to the north by the coastal region, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Ladies: It's better for any female traveler to say she's married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's also helpful to wear a ring (but not a ring that looks too expensive).
Ladies need to be aware that cultural differences can cause them harassment, such as being catcalled, having their hand grabbed, and other things.
Be strict in refusing men and don't be afraid to stick to your opinion (cultural differences or not, it doesn't matter!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it, then rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, and abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city and named it Dar al-Badia, and the Spanish merchants, who established trading posts there, called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Throughout the Old City, it's very easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan goods, like tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of jig-saw tools, but all of this is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Given that Goma is reasonably safe, we need to investigate any visits outside of Goma to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also considered a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, alongside some of the most affordable gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The standard (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
With relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu became used as a metaphor for distant and exotic lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, despite its reputation and the fact that it has an airport, which makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to desert sand.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' program " Wonders of the African World" on PBS.
The city is facing a stark contrast with the rest of the cities in the country because it's characterized by a more Arab identity than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered one of the most prominent national parks in South Africa (SANParks).
As is the case with all national parks in South Africa, there are conservation fees and daily entrance fees to the park.
It might also be helpful to buy a Wild Card, which provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all the national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider the main focal point.
The procession of buildings that forms the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a gleaming, ribbon-like design, highlighted by the presence of Victoria Harbour.
To see the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront across from it.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is crowded onto reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place where the British colonizers settled. So if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, you can start from here.
The Sundarbans is considered the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching for 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests aren't just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining terraces of the great jungle that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 square kilometers, almost a third of which is covered by water/swamps.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and it is estimated to currently contain 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) all day long, although most of them, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because buses between regions are usually full, it's best to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small, comfortable, and durable Japanese Coaster buses.
Shared taxis are considered a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places, like Paro (number 150) and Punakha (number 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the two towers reaches 83 meters, their length is 378 meters, and they have two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
The distance between the bridge and the road is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, but the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints is expected.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who survived by resorting to hunting, gathering edible materials, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was born, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish started a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve a large part of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will be held in December at the Polo grounds in Las Canitas.
You can also watch the smaller tournaments and matches here at other times of the year.
For news about polo tournaments and where to buy match tickets, check out the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
Can I exchange money at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West store?
The British pound will be widely accepted anywhere in the islands, and credit cards from Stanley and US dollars are also often accepted.
It's hard to believe credit cards aren't accepted on remote islands, even though they might take British and American currency; confirm with the owners beforehand to determine the acceptable payment method.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, summer is there when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical regions. In the summer months, temperatures can reach over 30 degrees Celsius.
The winter can be surprisingly cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity make the weather feel colder than expected.
There aren't distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons; the amount of rain stays roughly the same throughout the year.
Despite the fact that many of the animals in the zoo are used to seeing people, wildlife remains wild and we shouldn't feed or disturb them.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how smooth things are, bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack you.
Dozens of visitors get injured every year because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are big and wild and potentially dangerous, so leave some space between you and them.
In addition to that, you need to know that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking food that has a scent and maintain the cleanliness of the campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of slightly less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and was the official capital of Samoa from 1959.
The port was the site of naval clashes in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships sank, except for one British ship. Approximately 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the death of the supreme leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are several traffic jams due to the Auckland intersection between two of the most popular ports in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and most of them offer shade from Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitematā Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family-friendly beaches, crowded at times, with a nice collection of shops lining the shore. And the swimming there is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One," which isn't a complex beer, but it's enjoyable and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many types of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wine might be better for travel.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're worried about the source and cleanliness of the tap water.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", a cappuccino comes full of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, but the fruit juices are expensive yet excellent.
Many trips are organized to the coral reefs throughout the year, and it is rare for any damage to occur to these reefs.
Even so, I must take advice from the authorities, comply with all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 17°70'. It's also possible to find them at other times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not actively found in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind because they'll have a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Most travel agencies have deals with specific hotels, but you can book accommodations outside of those, like camping sites, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast and transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even flight and hotel packages.
And they can book on your behalf if you need time to think about the offer, or help you get documents you need for your trip (like a visa).
Despite that, any modifications or requests must be reviewed by the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
Regarding some festivals, the vast majority of attendees at music festivals decide to camp on-site, and most of them consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get in early so you can get a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that even though the music in the main stages might be over, you might find sections of the festival that continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have dedicated camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of your cabin, because passing through the ice causes a very strong vibration for people who are most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include some time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually put in a lot of effort to increase the amount of time and money that guests spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and it can be difficult to find exits.
And they usually have meals and special entertainment shows to keep the visitors in a good mood and so they don't have to leave the building.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages. Even so, intoxication impairs judgment, and all skilled gamblers know the importance of staying alert.
Every person driving their car on high-altitude roads or over mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or high temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and you can't drive like you do on asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall to get you stuck in a very short amount of time.
Visibility might be obstructed due to snow, fog, or ice on the car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are considered normal in many countries, and traffic continues without interruption throughout the year.
Safari trips may be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important for many visitors.
Using the popular term "safari" instead of overland travel to see the wonderful African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, get very close to the cars and allow the standard equipment to see them well.
Lions, leopards, and tigers can be shy sometimes, and you see them better only when you use binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "trek") involves hiking for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held between August 24th and September 5th, 2021. Some events will also be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the first Asian city to host two editions of the Summer Olympic Games, after having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, you might face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most cancellation policies didn't extend to cover coronavirus-related issues until July 2020, but the Olympics were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing approximately 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board for borrowing, even if there isn't one in the room.
If there's no iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if there is one.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (because it could cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in other areas, it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you're worried, you should consider buying bottled water that is well-sealed and from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter dangerous animals that they are not used to in their home country.
Epidemics can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in a worse case, cause allergies, spread poison, or transmit infection.
Contagious diseases, in and of themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill people, are not usually described as pests.
Duty-free shops are an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and fees in specific locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can save money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont represents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, because it frequently passes through isolated forest terrain.
If you're used to driving on rural roads, keep your mind open: most of them have very steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and subsequent sections – typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is more important than not.
It's strange that despite this, the cell phone service is much stronger here than in many other stretches of road, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very delicious, and in Bavaria they are very rich and diverse, resembling the pastries found in its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are popular, with apples being baked in pastries year-round, and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other types of nuts. A strong cup of coffee is often enjoyed with the popular cakes.
If you want small, rich pastries, try what's called, depending on the region, Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.

Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
It provides a great deal of stability for the rider. However, it can cause safety issues if the rider's legs get caught in it.
If a rider falls off a horse and their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize these risks, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel, a smooth sole, and are somewhat tight.
Subsequently, some saddles, especially English saddles, contain safety bars that allow the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by a rider who is falling.
Valle Cochamó is the premier climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a diverse range of walls and large granite boulders.

Snow sports on the slopes, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding over snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard on your feet.
Skiing is considered a major travel activity for a large number of enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski lovers," who plan to spend entire vacations skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - the history of cave paintings depicting skiers goes back to 5000 BC!
The history of downhill skiing goes back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or snowshoeing.
It's related to ice skating tours or mountain climbing, but not directly associated with them; the latter is done on steep slopes and requires stronger skis and boots.
Consider the ski trail like a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you'll be able to cover greater distances hiking - but you'll rarely get cross-country skiing quickly without a heavy backpack on prepared trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has several independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries can require applying for visas and passport control multiple times.
Along with that, the Schengen area functions almost like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, when you get a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a visa for each member country of Schengen separately, and this saves you time, money, and official documents.
There isn't a universal definition of manufactured items as antiques, but some tax agencies define goods that are over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition contains geographical variations, where the age limit might be shorter in places like North America compared to Europe.
It's possible to describe handmade crafts as keepsakes, even though they are smaller than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of income among the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for several other professions.
Even from a traditional standpoint, despite this, not all Sami people participated in reindeer herding on a large scale; rather, they lived off fishing, hunting, and things like that, and raised reindeer as draft animals.
Most Sami people today work in modern trades. Tourism is considered an important source of income for the Sami region in Sapmi.

The course will usually cover all the issues that were discussed here in much greater detail, and this is usually through practical experience.
Usually the course is from 2-5 days and will include role-playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that talk about wildlife conservation are common, but publications that talk about war zones are rare.
Travelers who want to undergo gender reassignment surgery must ensure they possess valid documents for their return journey.
Governments vary in their willingness to issue passports if gender is not specified (X) or to renew documents to match the preferred name and gender.
The desire of foreign governments to respect these documents is widely changing.
Security checkpoint screenings have become much more intrusive since 9/11.
Transgender people shouldn't be expected to go through scanners before surgery while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the backflow from a wave that breaks on the shore, often near coral reefs or something similar.
Due to the underwater topography, backflow concentrates in some of the deeper sections, and a fast deep-water current can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, and this can be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming backwards becomes much harder than usual.
Try to head towards the place where you got stuck, and depending on your skills and whether someone noticed you or not, you might wait to be rescued.
Reverse culture shock upon returning home will be less intense initially (than the honeymoon phase of culture shock), but it will last longer and can be more severe.
Some travelers who quickly adapted to the new culture face particular difficulty readjusting to their original culture.
When you return to your country after a long time abroad, you'll be accustomed to the new culture and will have forgotten most of your homeland's customs and culture.
When you travel for the first time, people are patient and understanding that people who come to a new country need time to adjust.
People might not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning to their home countries.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is considered one of the most exciting things in the region for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in peace before the show starts.

They are projecting scenes onto the pyramids and lighting up the pyramids in different ways.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and are claimed by several countries, having the largest number of bases, with sixteen active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. Its largest island is King George Island, with the Villa Las Estrellas settlement.
Other places include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the volcanic crater of an active volcano has been flooded, providing a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region located south of the Antarctic Peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge with the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth Mountains range, which is 360 kilometers long, and which is divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, namely the Vinson Massif, which peaks at 4,892 meters at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
Satellite phones are generally not considered a replacement for cell phones, because you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is used frequently via shipping, including pleasure boats, as well as exploration trips that have remote data and voice needs.
The phone service employee must be able to provide more information about subscribing to this service.
Traveling and learning are among the most common choices for people who are planning a gap year.
This is becoming widespread among school leavers, which allows them to spend a year before university without affecting their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a year-long training course abroad can improve your chances of transitioning to higher education again in your home country.
It's normal for there to be tuition fees to register for these educational programs.
Finland is a wonderful destination for ships. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" is located there, along with thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
In the archipelago and lakes, you definitely need a yacht from me.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are already big and sufficient for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with each boat accommodating seven or eight people.
And Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand are similar to it, but it's unique (like the Netherlands, the number of people starts from one to forty).

This means you can visit the historical city for a few full days, and return to sleep onboard the ship at night.
If you go to the shore only on a cruise ship, you won't need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not on the coast, and visiting the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't traveled before or have experienced a traumatic event.

For some, understanding something about how planes operate and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear caused by the unknown or by a lack of control.
Courier companies are paid well to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
Large companies own their private planes on some routes, but there was a problem on other routes with smaller companies.
If you sell things through air freight, it may take days for unloading and customs clearance on some routes.
The only way to get them there faster was to send them as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow sending baggage without a passenger, meaning on the same flight you're on.
The obvious way to travel first class or business class is to pay a hefty sum of money to get the perk, or better yet, have your company do it on your behalf.
This isn't cheap: As a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the fare for regular economy class to travel in business class, and 11 times for first class!
Generally, there's no point in looking for discounts on business class or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there's a specific core group of travelers who like to pay significant amounts for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and the fees are calculated accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău, and although the local language is Romanian, Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the unilaterally declared Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (Transnistria) in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any United Nations member state.
Economic ties between both parts of Moldova have been restored, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

There are still many men and women alive who managed to survive, and many of those who had loved ones were killed or remained steadfast until they died, Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, respect, and reverence it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by writing signs or scratching writing on the walls with structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Most of them prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
Most of the signs are in Catalan because it is mandated by law as the primary official language.

The Parisians' sudden infatuation with external designs will quickly evaporate if you offer some basic courtesies.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is full of forests, mainly beech and resinous trees similar to pine and fir, and is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.

Pre-modern observatories are usually neglected today, and remain as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution wasn't at its peak like the problem it is today, it was usually present in cities or on university campuses, and access to it is easier than to what was built in the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favorable weather conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms, known as Hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept came from China because plum blossoms were the favorite flower.
In Japan, the Emperor hosted the first cherry blossom viewing parties for himself and for non-aristocratic members around the imperial court.
Plants thrive best in their natural environment, so resist the urge to pick even "just one" sample.
If you're visiting a formally organized garden, collecting "samples" there will also get you kicked out, no question.
Singapore is generally considered a very safe and easy-to-navigate place, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But if you're in a "high tropical zone" just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll need to deal with the high heat (always) and the strong sun (but only when the sky is clear, which is rarely the case).
There are also a few buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.

In a tradition to commemorate Easter Eve, some open-air venues are intentionally accessible for watching the sunrise.
There are definitely Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could be pre-Christian spring and fertility rituals.
More traditional churches often organize the Easter Vigil on Holy Saturday during the Easter holiday, and gatherings often commence to celebrate at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands got here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to complete the journey, which allowed the giant tortoise to become the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, several mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
And it offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis when the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
