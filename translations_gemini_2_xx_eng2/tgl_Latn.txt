It not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but it also provides details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers are chestnut brown on the upper part with pale or carotenoid coloration on the underside.
The discovery also provided insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-defined shaft, called a rachis, but had other feather characteristics ”barbs and barbules,” researchers believed that the rachis was likely a more recent evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that even if it is a juvenile dinosaur's tail, the specimen shows that these are feathers of an adult dinosaur and not the downy, thin feathers of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not downy feathers.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

Most of the work done was theoretical, but the program was written to encourage observations regarding the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team is investigating is the impact of the enormous force between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon's gravitational pull on Earth causes tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have also concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter affects ordinary matter.
According to this theory, the majority of dark matter around a galaxy exists in a kind of limbo around it, and is made of a vast number of tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in KwaZulu-Natal, a region located in South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new strain is "deeply disturbing and alarming due to the high percentage of fatalities."
Dr. Moll suspects that some patients may have contracted the bacteria in the hospital, and at least two of them are hospital healthcare workers.

Their warm behavior is not as fixed as the large caves on Earth that tend to maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is as consistent with them as deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed slip of paper stating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter will drop the envelope into the ballot box and sign the list of qualified voters.
French electoral law is quite strict in codifying the processes.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be clear so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except those from eligible and authorized voters to be counted.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

In her other event, the Giant Slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a combined run time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place winner, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place winner, GyÃ¶ngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers from the group of women sitting down failed to finish their race, and 45 out of 117 skiers failed to place in the Giant Slalom race.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
According to Deputy Inspector General D K Aray, "We have arrested the five men who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused were named as Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused were presented in court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The street where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency responders extricated the driver from the red Audi TT.
She was previously hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterwards, he was transferred again to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of her child.
He is incarcerated while awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony may be tainted because his image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scotland has a different justice system and the courts have taken the view that publishing images has the potential to be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that "journalists do indeed seem to be walking a tightrope when publishing images etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is in charge of all prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
The document, according to what was revealed, refers to the border dispute, wherein Palestine desires it based on the pre-1967 Six-Day War borders.
Other topics are expected to include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a military presence in the valley for ten years if an agreement is signed, while the PA is only agreeing to such a presence for five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control trial will be carefully supervised by the rangers, as the trial is being monitored and its effectiveness is being evaluated.
In a collaboration between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were gathered under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, NPWS Park's Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety briefings and training.
The new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) was sworn in yesterday before Martelly.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the COMELEC chairman as part of preparations to lead the country to new elections.
The commission is Martelly's answer to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The protests, some of which have been violent, were sparked by frustration over the lack of elections, some of which were due as far back as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of defective iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said they were aware of the 27 accidents related to the devices since before.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at the local time of 07:19 a.m. (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas' emergency management office said no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there is no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer captured Hong Kong tourists by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many hostages were rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers relieved an elderly woman because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and worked in the field of medicine.
She studied to be an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature labor in his free time.
His research shows that administering a certain hormone can accelerate lung maturation in unborn babies.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Luna was also honored by wrestlers like him.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night of two moons. Uniquely special just like her. A brave woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels stated that "Luna was as weird as me...maybe even more so...I loved her and I miss her...I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, opposition to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed share this view, desiring Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
At opposite ends of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist swimmer is scheduled to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, the strength of his body is being questioned.
He can't take the drugs he needs to relieve his pain because they are banned in the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Several individuals verified the discovery using various hardware and software at the beginning of February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of delivering water to Earth, along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists want to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, due to comets colliding with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He labeled the news as "political chatter and nonsense."
He is suspected of running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the old ground-based radar technology so that air traffic controllers can pinpoint aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no additional transportation provided, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley. Car parking and park-and-ride facilities will also be unavailable in the area.
Fears of transportation shortages have raised the possibility that the fight will be forced to take place behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorean Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species underwent evolution in just two generations, even though this process was believed to take much longer, due to interbreeding between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be molded into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be drawn out until it becomes a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled until it becomes sheets.
It can be made extremely thin and adhered to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was once used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage extract.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity (basicity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being analyzed.
Hydrogen atoms consist of just a proton and an electron, and a separated hydrogen ion is commonly called a proton.
Combine the two dry powders and mix in a circular motion, then, using clean, wet hands, squeeze them together until they form a ball shape.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a skin-like layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro back then had toilets with a flush in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space will receive the call and almost immediately send it back down.
Satellites in space are sent via rockets. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere causes distortion of some of our light and vision.
A large rocket with a height of 100 feet is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in extraordinary ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us easier and faster transportation.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other transportation equipment.
Following them were many more cats of moderate size devouring the animal that had been hunted, which was of moderate size and ranged from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including stray pets) are eating more and more small victims such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is having a specific task or a specialized role to avoid competition among the cats.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and young lions.
Women often have close relationships with each other, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave much like wolf or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also extremely fierce towards their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger is able to climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four cats that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the power of a lion's roar, but more like a sentence of snarled, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot looks for are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate prey by smelling, sniffing out where they are on the ground.
They can see clearly in the dark through night vision, and they can also move stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their environment and then ambushing their prey.
If a small group of living things (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population they originated from (such as if they go to a mountainous area or across a river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from their origin.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a strong competitor than they previously needed.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, their appearance starts to become increasingly different from that of the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants make their own food using photosynthesis from the sun. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and fashion clothes from plants. Almost all the food we eat is plants. If there were no plants, animals could not live.
The mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws are lined with 70 sharp teeth, including an extra row on the roof of its mouth, meaning nothing that crosses its path can escape.
We cannot be certain, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex would not prevail against it.
Although we recognize many of their foods, the Romans also had amazing or extraordinary dishes prepared at feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rat called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, wealthy men preferred to have feasts together where they would recline while eating.
The cuisine of Ancient Rome likely did not include foods that traveled to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, let alone tomatoes, let alone potatoes, let alone cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was recognized as the house of the god.
The people will bring offerings for the gods, and the priests will try to attend to the gods' needs through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple has an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests may enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The tower's summit is a unique sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house became less important.
Much of Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
The women cook in the yard; the stores are just open-air counters facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There are no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the price of wood was very high.
Few people lived in Greenland. In long Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further west, he saw Greenland and named it Greenland.
But whatever he discovered, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian', many differences exist between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4th, 1776." The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Even though no one is certain of its author, it is known that in its early life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled for storage.
That's why the short note may have been placed to serve only as a marker.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated Northern France, but its south was still not free.
It was under the control of the French "Vichy." These were people from France who made a deal with the Germans in 1940 and became collaborators with the invaders rather than resisting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a very large group of people who live and support each other, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and it also somehow implies the size of the society.
City-states were the precursors to nations. Civilizational culture implies the passing of knowledge through many generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and equitable dissemination.
Subcultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as worthy civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government—Congress being its sole branch—under the Articles of Confederation.
The congress had no power to levy taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it was dependent on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
It also does not have the power to invalidate tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states did not take the central government seriously, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are best known in the Northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan holds nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island country in the world!
Because of Japan's group of islands, Japan is often called "the archipelago" due to its geographical location.
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in indigenous grain production practices and providing employment for Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three primary structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings along the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photography format worldwide for still captures is 35 mm, which became the dominant film size by the end of the analog film era.
It's still being done today, but more importantly, digital camera image sensor formats have inherited its aspect ratio.
The 35 mm format is, confusingly, actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divide by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) is effectively 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are approximately or equivalent to this aspect ratio.
The much-abused and often-mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a level of order in a photograph.
This suggests that the most effective area for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound the states of Europe together despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common person.
One of the core tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are there for that specific purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle is being met.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy has proven effective, cutting off essential supplies for both the military and civilians, although this blockade violated commonly accepted international law codified as a system through several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering that entire portion of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Because there had only been a limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing sentiment of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and brutalities of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods; each era of China or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
In between each dynasty were also periods of instability with divided provinces. The most well-known of these is the Three Kingdoms period, which occurred for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these times, a fierce war occurred between many nobles fighting to sit on the throne.
The Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to ascend to the highest position in the luxurious palace in Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Similarly, after the Revolution, jobs opened up to all male applicants, giving the most ambitious and successful the opportunity to thrive.
The same can be said of the military, because instead of army ranks being based on class, they are now based on skill in warfare.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad developed a deep interest in things beyond this worldly life. He would often go to the cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) for his contemplation.
The cave itself, having survived the ages, offers a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not really easy to find even if someone knows it exists. Once inside the cave, you are truly isolated.
Nothing can be seen but the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Only a tiny fraction of this world can be seen or heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the large pyramid structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upward slash" mark looks like a V, and the "downward slash" mark resembles a staple or a square without the bottom part.
Going uphill means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and going downhill means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upstroke usually produces a weaker sound, while a downstroke is louder and more assertive.
Feel free to write your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed markings for slide motion are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the King and Queen.
The King and Queen were forced to open the windows of their carriage wide because of the mob.
On one occasion a member of the mob waved the head of the king's guard captain, who had been killed at Versailles, in front of the horrified Queen.
The expenses of the United States' imperialist war in its conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to fund a large part of the expenses and the interest on the bonds that were floated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the excess profit derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constitutes the primary benefit of United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that prompted the formation of the order.
The period in which these events took place is often called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide variety of ideas, ranging from the advocacy of technology or the intense need for technology to the precise understanding that human destiny is motivated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that technological advancement itself follows a path beyond cultural or political power, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that cars drive the creation of roads.
However, the national road network would not be a profitable business if only a few vehicles used it, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Owning many cars leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new healthcare techniques for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism has a significant element of cultural determinism, originating from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time the customs and cultures associated with that geography emerged, and these, because they were in harmony with the society's place, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its recognition as a center of luxury began in 400 A.D. and lasted until 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the twelfth century due to the fact that Christian conquerors or Crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices that were more valued compared to what the Byzantine market could offer.
This is the era when the title of Fashion Capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at the height of its popularity between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western fashions may be left behind by 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest advances of that era, resulting from the Crusades, was that people began using buttons to close clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is practiced to produce enough food only to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses saved seeds native to the eco-region along with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to increase yield.
According to history, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, status, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, encompassing fashions, behaviors, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to consider the unfortunate circumstances of children who were not taught good manners by adults while growing up through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children were previously confined by people (often their own parents); in other cases, this abandonment of the child is due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Children with limited social interaction from a young age may have first experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived in the forest all alone.
When the animals have fully raised them, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limitations) that are almost like those exhibited by the animal that raised them, such as fear or coldness towards people.
While project-based learning should facilitate and make learning engaging, scaffolding support does more than just that.
Providing scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather an aid that provides support to individuals going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real. That is, a teacher is a form of scaffold as is Clippy from Microsoft Office.
Virtual support scaffolds are embedded in the software and aim to question, prompt, and explain procedures that may have been difficult for the student to tackle alone.
Children are placed in orphanages due to a multitude of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is uncaring, uncompassionate, and uneducative, yet they do.
We consider orphanages a safe place for these children.
Our orphanage system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, continuous education, and reliable healthcare.
The orphanage should provide all the needs that were lacking in their previous home.
The internet has unified the elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet pave the way for additional forms regarding the uses and gratifications approach.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in interpreting subtle expressions, facial movements that occur in just a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is said that a person can determine if someone is lying by correctly interpreting their micro-expressions.
In his essay, "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks pointed out how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He further suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domesticated dogs.
Research in the twentieth century revealed two groups of genetic diversity: cryptic and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of actually usable variation.
Segregation and recombination repeatedly shuffle variation between two pools each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino acid requirements from plant sources.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The easiest plant resources to obtain would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest them unless they are cooked.
Conversely, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also provide a wealth of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that savanna baboons do today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of deliberately waking yourself up during your usual sleep period and then going back to sleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself snoozing your alarm, it might be placed on the other side of your room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biological rhythms involve drinking plenty of water (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which prompts one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
If the tension is lower, the life force that exists will be more positive. Each person has the potential to find complete peace and tranquility.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it expands on the Mahayana path of compassion and a multitude of techniques derived from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all who love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of consciousness) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods. Through visualizing various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is generated.
Germany became the enemy of everyone during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, conflicts in system, process, and culture led to disagreements between the countries.
Within two years of the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies and the Cold War began.
It will last for the next 40 years and will truly be fought by proxy armies in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses were shattered, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and formed Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after attacking the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, whether bilateral or multilateral.
Using ships to deliver products is the best way of all for moving large numbers of people and products across oceans.
The job of naval forces, traditionally, is to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and products, while at the same time, preventing your adversary's ability to move their people and products.
One of the most recent notable examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of WWII (World War II). The Americans were then trying to get men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which primarily used U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have conquered Britain as it had already done in mainland Europe.
It appears goats were first domesticated nearly 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hide.
Domesticated goats are usually placed in herds that roam the mountains or other pastures, often cared for by shepherds who are often children or teenagers, similar to more well-known shepherds. This method of caring for the flock is still used today.
Wagonways were already being made in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the carts are made of parallel wooden planks, they allow horses to pull them faster and haul larger loads than on somewhat rougher roads.
Cross ties were used early on to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually realized that the rails would be better if they had a narrow strip of steel on top.
This practice became widespread, but the steel caused the wooden wheels of the carriages to wear down even faster.
Later, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The earliest known mode of transportation was walking, which began when humans started walking upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as habitually as they did.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have already been walking on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a way that is less harmful to our environment, we can join environmental movements, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering in some way.
It is similar to treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we must find the root of the problems and we must stop them from functioning.
It is sufficient to be clear that the world has changed greatly due to advancements in science and technology, and problems have become more severe due to overpopulation and people's luxurious lifestyles.
After it was ratified by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to the printing press of John Dunlap, which was a few blocks away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, which are now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his soldiers in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not believe that they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are so many things about birds that are still similar to those of dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all currently used computers are based on controlling information encoded using binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, e.g., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, when using computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that immediate testing might not be done.
The most obvious indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or poisonous chemicals in the house.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is derived from the ancient understanding of bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to infest humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs both depend for extended periods on hosts after birth, having adapted to live in the nest or case of their host.
Across the United States of America, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), considered a leading neurological disorder in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child to raise a baby.
The couple may decide to put their baby up for adoption.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides the majority of scientific research.
Experimentation isn't alone; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, and asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, especially, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, are accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West found itself distanced from its Greek philosophical and scientific origins.
Many of the observed rhythms in body structure and behavior are highly dependent on internal bodily processes and their production through a biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external seasonal cues, have been documented in the majority of living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain free-running cyclical timing even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the leading pieces of evidence suggesting that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments that labeled either the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects based on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are cells for sexual reproduction.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism appeals to people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including the plants and animals in the forest.
Examples of actual activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and learning about environmental information.
One example is visiting, taking pictures, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every day, people leave the small towns of the country in cars to get to their workplaces and pass by others whose workplaces are the place they came from.
In the dynamic ebb and flow of this transportation, everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Science now suggests that this large-scale carbon economy has displaced the ecological system (biosphere) from a stable state that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems have these kinds of complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers really incompetent? Or is there something more important happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
It's sad to say that traffic flow analysis is not easy because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave predictably within a consistent range; therefore, traffic flow is also consistent and can be estimated mathematically.
To better illustrate traffic flow, relationships were established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are helpful in the planning, design, and management of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily overcome their enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have an advantage in having the ability to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people believed he was right, but many people believed the opposite: that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems significant, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times the volume of water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching six miles in width.
The entire 20 percent of water that flows from the planet's rivers into the seas comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main river is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid building using stone did not stop until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza have never been surpassed in their size and in the technical brilliance of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then already more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian for its laws and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as they can all be found in nature in native form and are easily mined using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, posited that all matter is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It's more akin to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also posited that they become new things to form what we see.
Alloys are usually mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table and some of these are also metals (like calcium and potassium) and can be mixed with other metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it came out.
Sadly, as new forms of writing emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and usage.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, never needing to go near a pencil sharpener.
A person only realizes what could happen to a keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy must bind together the nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's probably like pushing a heavy cart uphill. So, splitting the nucleus again releases others into that energy.
Some atoms are those with an imbalance in the number of protons and neutrons, which means they are likely to decay when there is little to no matching number of protons and neutrons.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There might be more volcanoes in the visible part of the world because the Earth's crust is thinner. It's easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what motivates people or captures their attention.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they embrace as they get older.
These theories are about what drives some people to desire what they do and what things in their environment drive them to do or not do things.
Two well-known content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge as managers begin to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager struggles to make decisions that many won't like, to discipline, to assess performance, to assign responsibility, and to hold people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels he must change everything the group is already doing and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to misunderstandings between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams are also held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team often serve as points of contact for their respective physical groups.
They often have more autonomy than members of a standard team because their teams can meet across different time zones that their local management might not understand.
The presence of a genuine "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a distinct component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of building a learning organization? One objective for actively implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
If all resources are used effectively throughout an organization's active departments, creativity and talent can be expressed.
As a result, the organization's collaborative process to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process to better serve customer needs.
Before an organization of innovative ideas can even be formed, the leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Anghel (2006) explains the Continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical ways of investigating learning ability. Therefore, it limits the field of research and makes it more precise.
Scientists are exploring the connection between brain pathology and behavior in their research.
It has been known for a very long time that different types of brain damage, traumatic experiences, injuries, and unusual growths affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The rise of new technology has enabled us to see and examine brain structures and processes that were previously unseen.
It provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction undertones, AI forms a vitally important branch of computer science, concerning itself with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in AI involves creating automated machines that perform tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
AI tasks include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer reviews and inquiries, and also the recognition of handwriting, voice, and human faces.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-world problems.
AI systems are frequently used today in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, similar to what has been done in software applications for many home computers and video games.
Field trips are a big part of every classroom. Often, teachers would love to take their students to places where traveling by bus isn't an option.
Technology offers a solution through virtual educational tours. Students can view artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or marvel at beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing educational trips virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, each year the website's design is revamped, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often begin their blog writing experience with poor grammar and spelling, having readers usually changes this.
Because students are often the most critical viewers, the blogger started improving their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "forces students to be more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to cater to the audience's interest encourages students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a way that sparks collaboration and encourages students to continue learning beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively engaging with internet materials, students can identify their positions in the context of others' writings as well as formulate their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the captivating capital of Canada, bilingual, and features numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
In the far south lies Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things, and many more, highlight Ontario as what outsiders might consider quintessentially Canadian.
The vast areas in the north are sparsely populated, and some are almost deserts with no inhabitants.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens of Canada.
The islands in East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and can be considered a continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as upscale beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it became very important in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The Sahel borders the region to the north, and to the south and west is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any women traveling say they are married, regardless of their true marital status.
It would also help to wear a ring (as long as it doesn't look too expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can result in what they may consider harassment being common, such as being followed, touched on the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it's still unacceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, earthenware, leather goods, hookahs, and all sorts of trinkets, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of Congo in its easternmost part, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the town's roads, particularly in the town center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the state of fighting that continues in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of the most affordable mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The typical (local) fare is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Adding to its inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for exotic and faraway lands.
Currently, Timbuktu is an impoverished village, although its reputation is the reason for its popularity as a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sands.
This is one of the main destinations Henry Louis Gates visited in his PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is unlike any other city in the country, as it is more Arab-styled than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the Mozambique border to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms its southern boundary.
The park covers 19,500 kmÂ² and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting diverse wildlife.
This is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the pride of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, there is a daily conservation and park entrance fee.
It can also be beneficial for a person to purchase a Wild Card, which will allow entry into any of the selected parks in South Africa or all of the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island is the origin of the name of the Hong Kong territory and the area recognized by many tourists as the main focus.
The procession of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyscraper skyline has been likened to a gleaming bar chart reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of the development of Hong Kong Island's cities is on the dense portion of reclaimed land on the northern shore.
This is the place claimed by the British colonizers as their own, so if you are looking for proof of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest on Earth, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland across the coastal regions of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The portion of the forest located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps—they include some of the last remaining hope for the mighty woodlands that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 kmÂ², with one-third submerged in water/swampy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for wild animals, and it is estimated that there are now 409 Royal Bengal tigers and nearly 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it's best to buy tickets in advance a few days ahead.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are convenient and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (NU 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.50 m wide.
The height of the space under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, once the construction of the Brazilian customs inspection stations is completed.
The Guaraní are the most important indigenous group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture for their livelihood.
The Chaco region has been home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycura and Payagua, who subsisted through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the clash between Spanish conquerors and groups of native indigenous people.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve many of its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year is happening in December at the polo field in Las CaÃ±itas.
Smaller competitions and battles can also be found here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the Western FIC store.
British pounds are widely accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards are accepted in Stanley; United States dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and United States currency may be; check with owners in advance to find out what a good method of payment is.
Falkland Islands currency is almost impossible to exchange outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can have a deceptive chill: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer reads.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: rainfall remains fairly consistent throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife are nevertheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities say to stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may look, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, many visitors get injured because they don't maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, ferocious, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, it should be known that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking odorous foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and became the official capital of Samoa starting in 1959.
The port is the site of the well-known standoff of naval forces in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships sank, except for one British cruiser. Almost 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches because it sits between two harbors. The most popular ones are in three main areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the Northern Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of it is sandy beach where it's safe to go into the water, and most of it has shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded beaches frequented by families and have a good array of shops to be found on the shore. It is safe to swim in the sea.
The main local beer is 'Numero Uno', it's not a complicated beer, but rather pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
Many French wines can be bought, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more likely to remain in good condition during travel.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A short black is an 'espresso,' a cappuccino comes with a high mound of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juice-based drinks will be loved but are very delicious.
Many visits to the reef occur throughout the year, and damage from any reef-related cause is rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish appear near coastlines and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They are occasionally seen outside of these times.
Indeed, there are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not actively inhabiting the open ocean; their primary habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking early gives travelers peace of mind knowing they have a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although it's possible to book other types of accommodations, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even flight and hotel combinations.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to study the offer or take care of other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests must be coursed through the travel agency representative and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most attendees consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, arrive early to find lodging near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages has ended, there may be parts of the festival that will continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have designated camping areas for families with young children.
When traveling to the Northern Baltic in winter, check the location of your overnight lodging, as traveling on ice can cause quite serious noise for those deliberately affected.
Sea voyages to Saint Petersburg require spending time in the city. Travelers are free from visa requirements (see rules).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize the time and money that visitors spend. Windows and clocks are often absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers for food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests feeling good and to keep them on the premises.
Some places offer free alcohol. However, intoxication impairs decision-making ability, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or on mountain roads should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there isn't much traction, and you can't drive like you're on asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow to stall you can fall in a very short period.
The ability to see falling or blowing snow, or condensation or ice on vehicle windows, may also be limited.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic is not disrupted throughout the year.
Wildlife viewing or safaris are probably the biggest tourist draw in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari, in popular usage, refers to a trip on land to view the spectacular wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars closely, and standard equipment can allow for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy sometimes, and you're more likely to see them using binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "foot safari") involves hiking, which can last for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having already hosted the games in 1964.
If you already booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since late March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies don't extend as far as July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with standard tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that can be sat upon, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron available, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you have one.
Be careful not to let the cloth get too hot (this causes clothes to shrink, or in severe cases, burns).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, in others, more than one minute is required.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pest animals unfamiliar to their home region.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or, in more severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly harm or kill people, usually do not qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes in specific locations.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can sometimes save significant amounts of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.
The stretch of road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through remote wooded terrain.
If you're not used to driving on provincial roads, be alert: you might encounter steep, narrow roads with sudden turns.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower compared to the previous and subsequent sections â€” typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) â€” and strict adherence to them is even more important than before.
Oddly enough, the mobile phone service is stronger here than along many other routes, e.g., the Pennsylvania Woodlands.
German pastries are delicious, and in Bavaria, they are flavorful and varied, much like in its neighboring country to the south, Austria.
Fruit pies are common, apples are cooked into pies year-round, and cherries and plums appear in the summer.
Almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts are also a highlight in many German baked goods. Popular cakes are often enjoyed with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but fluffy pastries, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on what the region calls them.
A curry is a dish based on a blend of spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a collective term that encompasses the wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
However, when used without any further adjectives, the term generally refers to the food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a range of simply seasoned dishes, with dominant Javanese flavors favoring nuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various fragrant spices.
The stirrups on either side of the horse serve as support for the rider's feet.
These provide more stability for the rider but can pose a safety concern due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has one foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs. To reduce the risk, there are some precautions that can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and smooth, tapered soles.
Next, some saddles, particularly English ones, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leathers to fall away from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley - the premier climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, boasts a variety of large granite walls and slopes.
The peaks boast breathtaking views from their summits. Climbers from around the world continue to establish new routes amidst the endless potential of its walls.
Ice sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving rapid descent on ice-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity, with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," planning entire vacations centered around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old â€” cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing originated around the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski association was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
This is related, but typically does not employ alpine touring or mountaineering styles using skis, as the latter are done on steeper terrain and require stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a route similar to a hiking route.
In good conditions, you can cover significantly greater distances than walking – but you will rarely attain the speeds of cross country skiing without a heavy backpack on a groomed trail.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many countries would mean going through visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen area, however, functions similarly to a single country in this aspect.
While you remain in this zone, you can cross borders without having to go through passport control checkpoints again.
Likewise, with a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen member country, saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items qualify as antiques. Some tax agencies define products over 100 years old as antiques.
Meaning varies depending on the order of the world, where the length of the year may be shorter in places in North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be perceived as antiques, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding this occupation is also important for many who have other work.
Even traditionally, although not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry but lived from fishing, hunting, and the like, having reindeer was mostly as working animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the land of the Sámi.
Although it is widely used, especially by non-Roma, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Romani people.

As an example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different experiences than Europeans or Arabs.
The alerts are just brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The perspectives presented are often superficial, general, and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Extremely bad weather can occur anywhere in the world, and it has different types, which may depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are types and effects of extreme weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and typhoons.
Regional and seasonal severe weather conditions, including blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the danger of severe weather conditions affecting their area as these may impact any travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
Searching the internet for 'Course on Hostile Environment' will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course will typically cover all the issues discussed here in more detail, often with practical experience.
A course typically lasts from 2-5 days and includes role-playing, numerous first aid techniques, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and newspapers discussing survival in the wilderness are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they carry valid travel documents for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports that indicate unspecified gender (X) or documents altered to match a preferred name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as widely.
Security checkpoint screenings have also become more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity fully intact.
Strong rip currents are return flows from waves breaking on the shoreline, often near a breakwater, reef, or similar structure.
Due to the underwater topography, the backflow concentrates in certain deeper areas, and rapid water flow can develop there.
Most deaths occur from exhaustion trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back won't be any harder than normal.
Try to get to a place where you won't be swept away again, or, depending on your abilities and if you've been noticed, you might want to wait for help.
Reverse culture shock arrives sooner than culture shock (it has a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Sometimes, travelers who easily adapt to new cultures find it even more difficult to readjust to their original culture.
When returning to your home country after living abroad, you've become accustomed to the new culture and have lost some of your customs from your own homeland's culture.
When you first went to another country, people were likely patient and understanding, because they know that those traveling in a new country need to adapt.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You will see the pyramids in the dark and observe them silently before the show begins.
Usually, you always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The sound and light show is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx served as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes at the pyramids are shown, and the different pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the highest concentration of bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located about 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest is King George Island, which is home to Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others are Livingston Island, and Deception Island where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a remarkable natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Antarctic Peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains here merge into a plateau, then reappear to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, reaching a height of 4892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, where there is no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone is your only option.
A satellite phone is not a typical replacement for a mobile phone, because you need to be outside with a clear view of the satellite in order to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used by ships for sea travel, including ships for passenger leisure, and for voyages requiring data acquisition and calling.
The local phone service provider is expected to provide more information on how to connect to this service.
A growingly popular travel option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
It's extremely popular with school leavers, allowing them to take a gap year before college without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year program abroad can actually improve your chances of getting into higher education in your own country.
There is usually a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a wonderful destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, located in the lakes and archipelagos along the coast.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you won't always need a yacht.
Although the islands near the coast of the continent and the largest lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, small boats or even kayaks offer a unique experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is on par with Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is truly exceptional (e.g., in the Netherlands the number is one in forty).
Almost all unique Baltic Cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historical city for two full days while returning and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you are only disembarking at the shore via ship for a tour, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some sea voyages feature Berlin, Germany in brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and visiting the area is not included in the cost of the sea voyage.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a distressing experience.
This is not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and dislikes that so many other people have.
For some, understanding something about how aircraft work and what happens on a flight can help overcome fear based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Delivery companies are paid handsomely for the fast delivery of goods. Often, time is of the essence for business documents, merchandise, or parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and with smaller companies there is a problem.
If they ship the goods via air freight, an alternative route may take several more days to clear unloading and customs.
The only way to get it through faster is to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow shipping it unaccompanied by a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The easiest way to fly first class or business class is to pay a hefty sum for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company pay for it for you).
However, it's not cheap: as a gauge, expect to pay up to four times the standard economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no reason to further search for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that certain groups of travelers are willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of getting to a place quickly and conveniently, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the disagreement led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency but unrecognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between the two parts of Moldova have been re-established despite failed political negotiations.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

Please treat the place with all the honor, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not tarnish the reputation of this place by destroying its structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, almost all signs are written only in Catalan because it is mandated by law as the first official language.
However, the use of Spanish was also widespread in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the Metro are only made in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced through an automated system in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being selfish, rude, and arrogant.

The perceived rudeness of Parisians quickly disappears if you show simple respect.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mostly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and features a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has diverse plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, varied terrain, and different elevation levels.

Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be found there, along with more common species.
While visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and must also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide shawls for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the entrance supply, but that clothing is not washed after each use, so you may not be comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
Mojarcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil.
A simple popular dinner, especially in the summertime, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and any toppings available such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, besides the word "Sie" for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.

However, people who know a little Spanish might immediately conclude that it's almost the same as Portuguese and doesn't need to be studied separately.
Observatories built before the modern era are often obsolete today, remaining as museums or places for education.
Because light pollution wasn't as much of a problem back when they were popular, they were usually located in cities or on campuses, making them easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are very large facilities in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea of plum blossoms being the chosen flower originated in China.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were held by the emperor exclusively for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants are most beautiful to see in their natural environment, so resist the urge to take even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also get you kicked out, without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place and it's very easy to find places you want to visit there, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
But because of its location in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator you have to contend with both heat (constantly) and intense sun (when the sky is clear, which is less frequent).
There are also some buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check if the bus you're planning to ride is going into Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.

All animals that originally reached the islands arrived here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the distance from the continent, mammals could not travel, so large tortoises became the primary source of animals in the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the long night or polar night, which means the sun does not rise.
This offers a great opportunity to see the Aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark for approximately twenty-four hours.
Because the population is small in these areas, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
The work culture of the Japanese is more reliant on rank and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Suits are the common business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is very important, emphasizing group effort instead of praising individual achievements.
