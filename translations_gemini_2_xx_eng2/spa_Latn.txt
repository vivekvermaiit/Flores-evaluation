USA Gymnastics supports the US Olympic Committee's note and recognizes that it is imperative that the Olympic family foster a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of athletes, clubs, and their sports can be better served by moving forward with significant changes within our organization, rather than withdrawing certifications.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how the abuse that the survivors of Larry Nassar so courageously described could have gone unnoticed for so long, and accepts any necessary and appropriate changes.
The goal of USA Gymnastics and the USOC is the same: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a protected, positive, and empowered environment.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an advisor and, later, for the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.
He advised Carter on foreign policy matters in the 1976 election. Subsequently, he served as National Security Advisor (NSA) between 1977 and 1981, succeeding Henry Kissinger.
As National Security Advisor, he assisted Carter in the diplomatic handling of international affairs, such as the Camp David Accords of 1978, the normalization of relations between the United States and China in the late 1970s, the Iranian Revolution of 1979, which led to a hostage crisis in Iran, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.

In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory already widely accepted, it also offers specific data that fossils generally do not provide, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to specialists, this animal has brown plumage on its upper part and a pale or carotenoid hue on its lower part.
Furthermore, the discovery allows for a better understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Given that dinosaur plumage lacks a well-developed central shaft, called a rachis, but does exhibit other feather characteristics (barbs and barbules), researchers concluded that the rachis is likely the result of a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the plumage suggests that its function was not related to flight, but rather that it was used to regulate temperature or as an indicator of it. Researchers argue that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the analyzed sample shows features of an adult's plumage and not that of a chick.
The experts' assessments were that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrates the plumage of an adult more than that of a chick.

He warns that no one can guarantee that any Iraqi action at this point will stop the sectarian strife, the increasing violence, or a drift toward chaos.
The report begins with a call for open debate and the formation of a consensus in the United States regarding policies on the Middle East.
The report is highly critical of virtually every aspect of the current policy of the executive branch in Iraq, and calls for an immediate change of direction.
It contains 78 recommendations, the first of which is the adoption of a new initiative before the end of the year with the purpose of protecting Iraq's borders from hostile operations and to restore diplomatic ties with its neighbors.
Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who currently holds the position of senator and is the First Lady of the Argentine Republic, announced last night in La Plata, a city located 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires, that she will be running for president.
The Teatro Argentino was the place where Mrs. Kirchner announced her intention to run for president; this is the same place where she began her campaign for the senate in 2005, representing the province of Buenos Aires.
The issue that sparked the debate was the controversy surrounding the budget allocated for relief and reconstruction following Hurricane Katrina, a measure that some fiscal conservatives jokingly labeled the "Bush New Orleans Deal."
The liberals' criticism regarding the restoration work focuses on the fact that reconstruction contracts have been awarded to people who appear to be Washington officials.

The community's anger led to the current efforts to draft a policy on the site's sexual content, which hosts millions of openly licensed media.
While the work was primarily theoretical, the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
Tidal forces between the dark matter present in the galaxy and that of the Milky Way would be what causes the effect expected by the group of scientists.
The Milky Way influences the Sagittarius galaxy in the same way that the moon exerts a gravitational pull on our planet and causes tides.
Experts concluded that dark matter affects itself in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory posits that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around it in a kind of halo and is composed of numerous small particles.

Extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was first detected by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African area of Zululand.
During an interview, he pointed out that the new variant generated "a lot of concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus within the hospital, and that at least two of those infected were healthcare workers at that hospital.
In one year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom they have had close contact.
In any case, the percentage of XDR-TB in the total group of tuberculosis patients still appears to be small: 6000 out of a total of 333,000 infected individuals at a particular time in South Africa.

The authorities have also secured several million vials of the encephalitis vaccine, allowing healthcare companies to prepare for the coming year.
This year, the scarcity of monetary resources and low prioritization compared to other diseases have caused delays in the execution of vaccine delivery plans in historically vulnerable regions.

With the construction of the dam in 1963, the seasonal floods that deposited sediment along the river were stopped.
This sediment was necessary for the formation of sandbanks and beaches, which, in turn, functioned as habitats for wildlife.
As a result, two species of fish have become extinct, and two others are in danger of extinction, including the humpback chub (Gila cypha).
While the water level will only rise a few feet past flood stage, authorities hope it will be enough to replenish the eroded sandbars downstream.

As shown by the infrared images, the temperature variations during the night and day indicate that they are likely caves.
During the day, its temperature is lower than that of the surrounding surface, and at night, it is higher.
"While its thermal behavior is not as regular as large caves on our planet, which tend to maintain a fairly stable temperature, it is consistent with these deep cavities in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the US Geological Survey (USGS) archeology team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After officials verify the identity of the person who comes to vote, they insert the envelope into the ballot box and sign the voter list.
French electoral law establishes the procedures rather strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent, which allows voters and observers to verify that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of the voting process and that no envelopes are added other than those of eligible voters, duly counted and authorized.
Candidates have the right to send representatives to monitor each stage of the process, and at night, volunteers count the votes under rigorous supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

The bill stipulates that violent video games sold in the state of California must be labeled with a sticker bearing the legend "18" and penalizes their sale to minors with a fine of $1000 for non-compliance.
The Director of Public Prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning informing that Huhne and Pryce would be brought to trial.
Huhne has resigned, and Ed Davey MP will replace him in the cabinet. Norman Lamb MP is expected to take over the position of business minister that Davey is leaving vacant.
February 16th is the date on which Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear before the Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback, 25 and 21 years old, respectively, died. The latter was driving.
Edgar Veguilla sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider required facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon jammed while pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers permanent pain, is blind in one eye, is missing part of his skull, and his face had to be reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via a virtual link from a U.S. Air Force base in his home country.
Carpanedo participated in two individual races of the championship in addition to Wednesday's competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he got a "Did Not Finish the first run," as did 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other event, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting group with a combined running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first-place Austrian finisher, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth-place finisher, Gyöngyi Dani, of Hungary.
Four sit-ski athletes failed to complete their runs, and a total of 45 participants out of 117 in the Giant Slalom did not qualify in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police were able to recover the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Assistant Inspector General D.K. Arya stated, "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza, and Vishnu Kanjar are the defendants.
According to Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Despite the fact that there were three people inside the house at the time of the car's impact, none of them suffered injuries.
Nevertheless, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from inside the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was transferred to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court, accused of the murder of her son.
While she is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, any eyewitness testimony may be questionable, as her image has been widely disseminated.
It is a common practice in other regions of the United Kingdom, but because the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs as something potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted: "Journalists appear to be treading on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about suspects."
The Crown Office, which is in charge of prosecutions, told reporters that no further comments would be made at least until the indictment is issued.
According to leaked information, the document will address the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the borders in place prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that were also addressed, according to reports, include the future status of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA only accepts five.
During the supplementary pest control trial, the rangers had to closely supervise the shooters, as its effectiveness was being monitored and evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., suitable volunteers were recruited from within the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is temporarily in charge of the NPWS Park's Conservation and Heritage office, pointed out that comprehensive safety and training was provided to the four shooters chosen for the shooting operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its acronym in French).
In four years, it's Martelly's fifth CEP.
Last month, a presidential commission advised that the previous CEP resign, as part of a series of measures seeking to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests that began in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, sometimes violent, were sparked by the fact that elections have not been held, in some cases since 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of iPods with malfunctions and excessive overheating have been reported, resulting in six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it had recorded 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company categorized as "not serious."
The ministry commented on the delay in the Apple report, saying it was something "truly regrettable."
Mariana was shaken by an earthquake at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT) on Friday.
The Northern Marianas' emergency management agency indicated that there were no reports of damage in the territory.
Likewise, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer from that country hijacked a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong captive.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 on the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued, and so far, it has been confirmed that at least six have died.
Both the six hostages, among whom were children and elderly people, and the Filipino photographers were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an old woman because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was riddled with bullets.
Liggins followed the same path as his father and began to study medicine.
She trained in obstetrics and joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland around 1959.
Liggins began his research on premature birth in his spare time, while working at the hospital.
Their study showed that fetal lung maturation in the baby could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government investigators successfully recovered the black box flight recorders on Wednesday.
Luna's fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to her.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. She passed away on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels stated, "Luna was just as weird as I was; even, perhaps, more so. I love her and I will miss her. I hope she is in a better place."
Since 2008, among the 1400 people surveyed prior to the 2010 federal elections, there has been an 8% increase in those who oppose Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, then-interim prime minister, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign ended.
34% of those surveyed share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
At one end of the survey is 29% of people who believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; at the other end, 31% who believe it should never do so.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been questioned following his complaints.
She hasn't been able to take any pain medication because its use is prohibited at the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known.
Many people verified the finding through the use of various types of hardware and software, and it was released on Tuesday at the beginning of February.
Comets may have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the capacity to form proteins and sustain life.
The scientists' expectation is to understand how planets originate, particularly our own, given that comets crashed into Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor at the beginning of the year and last month signed a bill allowing same-sex couples to marry.
He dismissed the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he/she will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce the distances of air routes, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast to older ground-based radar technology, in order to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise data.
Additional transportation will not be implemented, and trains will not stop at Wembley. Car parking and park-and-ride will not be available.
Due to concerns about potential transportation issues, the possibility of holding the game behind closed doors, without the team's fans, was considered.
On Thursday, the journal Science released a study reporting the emergence of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University in the U.S., and from Uppsala University in Sweden, announced that the new species managed to evolve in just two generations, even though it was estimated to take much longer, due to reproduction between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and a migrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take all kinds of shapes and be rolled into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it can also be stretched into a very thin wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be made very thin and adhere to another metal. Such thinness can be achieved that it used to be used to decorate handmade illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice will change depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the analyzed chemical determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron. Therefore, a hydrogen ion is the result of stripping a proton of its electron.
Shake both dry powders together, and after doing so, with sanitized and damp hands, squeeze them to form a ball.
A reaction will occur between the moisture in your hands and its outer layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, which were connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Traces of sewage systems have been found in some homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
They also had toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, public baths had latrines, and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is thousands of miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space via a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, since the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and view that we have.
A giant rocket, over 100 feet tall, is needed to carry a satellite or telescope into outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it has done for us was to provide us with much simpler and faster transportation.
Thanks to her, today we have many means of transportation, such as the railroad or the automobile, among so many others.
Below, there are felines of more moderate size that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including independent domestic cats) that feed on small species that exist in much greater numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept: each feline has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social felines, and their lives unfold within large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males from the same family group, united with up to thirty females and their young.
Generally, the females are closely related to each other, which makes them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides have the same behavior as wolf or dog packs, with whom they share a surprising similarity (unlike other large felines) both in their behavior and in being highly lethal to their prey.
An all-around athlete, the tiger has the ability to climb (though not very well), swim, make extensive leaps, and pull five times stronger than a robust person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four felines capable of roaring.
The tiger's roar is not a fully sonorous roar like the lion's, but rather like a prayer of words spoken in growls and shouts.
Ocelots enjoy feeding on small creatures. Whenever possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all of their prey will be much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) through their sense of smell, by sniffing the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and vision in dark places, and furthermore, they move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main group from which they originate (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, and therefore, a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it had before to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still requires the same adaptations as in the past.
As time passes, and as the fledgling population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that it will not be possible to classify them as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and it is an unavoidable consequence and fundamental part of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (that they emit).
Plants generate their own food using solar energy through photosynthesis. Additionally, they offer us shade.
We build our houses from plants, and we also make clothing with them. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, therefore it feared nothing, except others of its own kind.
Its long jaws were embedded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, in addition to another set in the palate, meaning that anything that crossed its path had no escape.
We don't know for sure, but it could have had viperfish. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a dinosaur as enormous as the T. Rex was a threat to it.
While most of that food would seem quite familiar to us, the Romans also ate certain unconventional items at banquets, such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and even a type of rodent, the dormouse.
Another difference was that humble people and women ate sitting on chairs, while the wealthy enjoyed sharing banquets and reclining while they ate.
It's impossible that ancient Roman recipes included foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For instance, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cacao, and no Roman of antiquity ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple for each of their gods, considered to be their home.
People brought sacrifices for the gods, and the priests sought to satisfy their needs by celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard followed by an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramidal towers called ziggurats were built to form part of the temples.
The top of the tower constituted a special sanctuary for their deity.
In the midst of the warm Middle Eastern climate, the house was of no great importance.
Hebrew families spent most of their time outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just counters opening onto the street. The houses were built of stone.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests; therefore, wood was extremely expensive.
Very few inhabitants lived in Greenland. According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for homicide and, during a voyage he undertook further west, he discovered the island and gave it its name.
Even so, without prejudice to his discovery, the Eskimo tribes already inhabited the place by that time.
While each country was individually "Scandinavian," there were marked differences in terms of the people, monarchs, customs, and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might believe that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Nevertheless, that is not true. While the back of the document does contain something written, it is not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence has the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" written on its back. The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known for certain who drafted it, it is known that as soon as it was made, the enormous parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation was added merely as a label.
While the D-Day landings and subsequent engagements had achieved the liberation of northern France, the southern part remained.
His government was in the hands of the French of "Vichy," who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed to peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the so-called "Operation Dragoon" was launched, through which the Allies invaded southern France.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had achieved the liberation of southern France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture that encompasses a large group of people who live and work together; that is, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related both to the word civis, from the same language, which means citizen, and to civitas, the meaning of which is city or city-state and which, furthermore, determines the size of the society in some way.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilization's culture entails a prolonged generational transmission of knowledge, a lasting cultural legacy, and a homogeneous propagation.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and fail to be recognized as civilizations in their own right.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which Congress was its only component.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, that function fell to state authorities, who often did not cooperate in enforcing all of their laws.
He was also not empowered to repeal tax laws or tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all states to be amended, and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often failed to attend.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in northern areas, with athletes participating in international tournaments and Olympic events.
In Japan, there are approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomeration/group of islands it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors navigating the area recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the establishment of a base in southwestern Taiwan by the Dutch East India Company initiated a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the use of Chinese labor to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing dynasty army (1644-1912) seized control of the northern and western coastal region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared the latter a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government adhered to the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, who retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed so that tourists can visualize what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had already been restored, and work continues to this day.
To exemplify, the most common still image photography format globally is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size towards the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its dimensional ratio was transferred to the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In truth, the 35mm format is somewhat confusing, as its measurements are 36mm wide by 24mm high.
Therefore, it is said that the dimensional ratio of this format (dividing by twelve in order to calculate the simplest whole number ratio) is equivalent to 3:2.
Many typical formats (for example, the APS group of formats) are the same as, or very similar to, this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been constantly mocked and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that generates dynamism while allowing a certain order to be given to images.
Indicate that the most effective position to place the central object is at the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was challenged.
For over a millennium, Christianity had managed to unite the European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the commoners.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are reserved for that specific purpose.
The central dome of the church had remained in Rome for over a millennium, and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved disrupting vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, this measure violated widely recognized international law as enshrined in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain drew international waters into entire sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, even endangering neutral vessels.
Having received a muted response to this tactic, Germany expected to encounter a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during World War I, countries wanted to prevent such a situation from repeating itself in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the U.S. to take a job at the Edison company in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of demarcating different periods of time. Each stage or each ruling family constituted a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there also existed a period of instability, with divided provinces. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms period, which developed over 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a bloody war broke out between many nobles vying for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the Three Kingdoms period, where thousands of people died in a struggle to occupy the throne of the grand palace in Xi'an.
Its political and social consequences are numerous, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism, and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single sovereign.
Likewise, after the Revolution, the positions were open to all male candidates, which allowed for the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same goes for the military, since, instead of basing army positions on class, they are now based on merit.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other people from the oppressed working class in other countries to face their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which endured through time, very realistically illustrates Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
At the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca lies a cave completely isolated from the rest of the planet.
Indeed, it is very difficult to find, even if one were sure of its existence. Inside the cave, the isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen but the marvelous clear sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. From inside this cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
Of the Seven Wonders, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, erected by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, is one of many pyramidal structures of great size built to venerate the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many other similar structures, smaller tombs and temples, were erected in honor of his wives and family.
The "upward bow" mark resembles a V, and the "downward bow" mark is similar to a staple or a square without its bottom edge.
Up means that you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means that you should start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull it.
The upward movement of the bow produces a softer sound, while a downward movement is louder and more abrupt.
Feel free to make your own markings in pencil, but don't forget that the markings on the bowed instruments have been printed there for a musical purpose and should therefore be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced the terrified monarch Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, their two young children (eleven-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis Charles), and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back towards Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob who were shouting and throwing threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of an executed royal guard in Versailles in front of the queen, who was in a panic.
The Filipino people themselves paid for the U.S. imperialist war expenses in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime in order to cover most of the expenses and interest on the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government in Wall Street banks.
From the beginning, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the main profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The European historical period in which these events are situated is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, between the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (that is, between the years 1000 and 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that pragmatically encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the technological impulse or imperative to a strict sense that there is an underlying logic driving humanity's destiny, which is related to the laws of science and how they are embodied in technology.
Nearly all interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: that technological development itself unfolds along a path independent of any cultural or political influence, and that, at the same time, technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a small volume of cars, so new manufacturing techniques are being designed to reduce the costs of owning a vehicle.
The widespread use of automobiles also leads to a higher incidence of traffic accidents, which drives the development of new techniques in the healthcare field to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in Romanticism, according to scholars such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and cultures developed related to that geography, which, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the city of fashion today, Constantinople was considered as such in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 BC and extended until approximately 1100 AD.
During the 12th century, its status declined, mainly because, upon their return, the crusaders brought gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "fashion capital" was then transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style occurred in the period between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing styles were greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
Nevertheless, due to the slowness of communication channels, Western styles could be delayed by about 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advancements of that era was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is understood as that whose objective is to produce enough food to exclusively satisfy the needs of the farmer and their family group.
Subsistence farming is a simple practice, generally organic, that combines the use of stored seeds originating from the ecological region with crop rotation or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, a large part of the main activity of farmers was subsistence agriculture, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization due to social standards, and provide them with the opportunity to create a sense of identity.
Many factors can distinguish subcultures, such as the age, ethnicity, class, location, or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographic, or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit traits of their belonging by using distinctive and symbolic style, such as fashions, gestures, and jargon.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms to illustrate the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
These children are nicknamed "feral." Some feral children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, a child's abandonment is due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that feral children have suffered traumatic situations or severe child abuse before being abandoned or running away.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived on their own in the wild.
When a feral child is raised exclusively by animals other than humans, they exhibit behaviors (within their physical capabilities) almost entirely identical to those of the specific animal that cared for them, as well as fear or indifference towards people.
Even though project-based learning should facilitate that process and make it more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a learning technique; rather, it is assistance that provides support to those going through a new experience, such as using a new software program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be presented in both real and virtual formats; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffold, but so is the little animated paperclip from Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are incorporated into the software, and their function is to question, stimulate, or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student on their own.
Children are taken into foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment lacking love, care, and education; but it happens.
We can perceive that the foster care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, consistent education, and reliable medical care.
The goal of foster care is to meet all the needs that were not being met in the home from which they were previously taken.
The internet unites and mixes elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct features of the Internet pave the way for new dimensions from the perspective of the uses and gratifications concept.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are identified as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
During a study of user reactions to websites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), "personal involvement" and "lasting relationships" were also detected as new motivational factors.
Through video recording, significant findings have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are movements in the face lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that, through the proper reading of their microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," explained how those who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can nevertheless accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has demonstrated the existence of two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation process introduces new genetic variation; selection removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variation between one generation and the next.
In the savanna, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of humans, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plant resources available to it.
Moreover, not doing so carries serious problems: growth slowdown, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The proteins present in leaves and legumes would have constituted the most easily accessible source of plant resources, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, foods derived from animals (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest while providing a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
Ultimately, it shouldn't surprise us if our own predecessors solved their "protein problems" in the same way as savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep procrastination involves intentionally interrupting one's normal sleep period by waking up and then going back to sleep after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a more or less gentle alarm clock that brings you back to a conscious state, though without fully waking you up.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options based on the biological clock involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force we have to draw on. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and bliss.
We can all achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way is our tension and negativity.
While the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of the Buddha, they were expanded upon through the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
Generally speaking, Layaism is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation, and the all-encompassing path of love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment) is activated through yoga postures, breathing practices, mantras, or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on Devata Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, energy channels can be unblocked, chakras activated, and awareness of enlightenment developed.
Cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. Once the war ended, clashes of system, process, and culture eventually distanced the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would extend for the next 40 years and would be truly fought, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Because by September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, their only hope was to retreat and reorganize in the Romanian bridgehead area.
Nevertheless, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army combatants from the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Peace of Riga Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
Since always, the function of the navy has been to guarantee that its country retains the ability to move its population and goods, while interfering with the enemy's capacity to do the same.
The North Atlantic campaign in World War II offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean in order to support Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using submarines, was trying to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies hadn't been successful, Germany could have taken power in Great Britain, just as it did with other European countries.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
In order to easily obtain their milk, hair, meat, and leather, ancient peoples and tribes began to keep them.
Domestic goats were generally gathered into herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the more popular shepherd. These grazing methods are still used today.
In England, railway tracks had already been installed by the 16th century.
Even when the rails for the carts were made of simple parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve greater speed and haul heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the day.
The incorporation of sleepers to hold the rails in place occurred quite early. However, they gradually realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were coated with iron on their upper part.
This became a common practice, although the iron caused greater wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with ones made of iron, and in 1767, solid iron rails began to be used.
The first known form of transportation was walking. Humans began doing it upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
While traces of bipedalism have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can start living a more planet-friendly life, join environmental movements, or even become activists and fight to alleviate future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, it's like treating the symptoms without addressing the underlying cause. But if we're not just looking for a temporary fix, we should find the root of the problems and try to neutralize them.
It is evident that the world has undergone great changes, a product of humanity's technological and scientific advances, and the problems have intensified due to overpopulation and people's extravagant lifestyles.
After being approved by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, which are now known as the "Dunlap Copies."
It was John Nixon who first read the document, and he did so in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
On July 6th, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it to be read to his army in New York on July 9th. On August 10th, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. They are the birds.
Many people don't picture them as dinosaurs, since they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still make them resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaly, clawed limbs, lay eggs, and move on their hind legs just like the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers operate based on the manipulation of data encoded using the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, which are 0 and 1, and according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to allow for an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be finding an open bottle of medicine or toxic chemical cleaning products.
Read the label for specific first aid information relevant to that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term parasitic insect in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its ancient association with bedbugs, a species highly developed to parasitize humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, being adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
The number of registered cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the U.S. is approximately 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, comprising the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve, is the target of attack in multiple sclerosis.
Studies indicated that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple might conclude that raising a baby would not be the most convenient thing for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to plan for the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to decipher how the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for most scientific research.
It is not, however, an experimentation; it is a test used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was placed on classical works, especially the Latin version of the biblical text.
The thoughts of Aristotle, especially regarding science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the mastery of the Greek language declined, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots, both philosophical and scientific.
Frequently, many rhythms present in physiological processes and behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only about reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate in a self-sustained manner and have a free-running cyclical period, even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA consisted of genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using phages, or viruses.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while those that occur in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism often attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes animal and plant wildlife.
Some examples of possible activities on site include: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
One example is visiting, taking photographs, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs and often cross paths with others whose jobs are in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transfer shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on the use of private cars.
Currently, scientists argue that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states, which has contributed to the evolution of humanity for the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems; and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
What is the reason that transportation systems give rise to complaints of such magnitude, and why do failures occur daily? Are transportation engineers simply incapable? Or is there something more substantial happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is not a simple task, as it is not possible to make exact predictions about driver behavior.
Fortunately, there's a tendency for drivers to maintain relatively consistent behavior, which allows traffic flows to have a logical consistency and be subject to approximate mathematical representation.
In order to more clearly illustrate the flow of circulation, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships facilitate both the planning and design as well as the operations of road devices.
The first species to take flight were insects. This helped them evade their enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, sticking them to the sides of their body.
This provides them with a wider range of potential small places to hide from predators.
Currently, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects unable to fold their wings.
Millennia ago, a man named Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, including the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since we don't perceive its movement on Earth, right?
The Amazon River is the largest by discharge of water in the world, and the second longest. It contains 8 times more water than the next largest river.
Furthermore, the Amazon is the widest river on the planet, in some places reaching a width of up to six miles.
Of the total water from the world's rivers that flows into the oceans, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River has an extension of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, those of Giza were never surpassed, neither in size nor in the sublimity of their construction technique.
The ancient Egyptian people of the New Kingdom were awestruck by the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were over a millennium old.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world, both in size and population.
Italian is used in Vatican City, both for drafting its regulations and for issuing its official communications.
The language spoken daily by most of those who work within the state is also Italian, and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All of the citizens who live in Vatican City adhere to the Roman Catholic religion.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known since antiquity, since they can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything is formed from a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It bore a greater resemblance to the states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, only at the same time, it held the theory that they transform into new substances that make up the things we see.
Alloys are basically a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like gold and silver.
It is also possible that there are alloys with small amounts of elements, such as carbon, which are non-metallic.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of small particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively tiny that the period at the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
Therefore, when it was invented, the pencil gained many friends.
Unfortunately, as a result of the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Nowadays, people write messages on their computer screens. They don't even need to go near a pencil sharpener.
It only remains to wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when rolling a heavy cart uphill. By splitting the nucleus once more, it releases some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, meaning they tend to decay with minimal or almost no prompting.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar maria and thicker under the highlands.
It's possible there are more maria on the near side because its crust is thinner, which made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying what attracts or appeals to people.
These doctrines hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew to adulthood.
These theories analyze what causes certain people to want the things they do and what factors in their environment compel them to do, or not do, certain things.
Two well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two types of behavior can occur when managers begin to lead their former peers. On one side of the spectrum is the attempt to continue being "one of the guys" (or girls).
Managers in this category find it difficult to make decisions that employees dislike, impose disciplinary measures, conduct performance evaluations, assign responsibilities, and demand accountability from staff.
At the other end of the spectrum, they mutate into an unrecognizable person who believes it necessary to change everything the group has been doing up until now and do it their way.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often ends up distancing leaders from the other team members.
The same standards of excellence that conventional teams operate under apply to virtual teams, although there are slight differences.
Frequently, members of a virtual team operate as a point of contact for their closest physical group.
Generally, they enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, thanks to the fact that it is possible for their teams to meet according to different time zones that, for example, might not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) also constitutes a unique element of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports. It's the one that sets the standards for each member.
What reason might an organization have for undertaking the demanding process of establishing a learning organization? One purpose of applying the theoretical concepts of organizational learning is to drive innovation.
When all available resources are used appropriately in the operating departments of an organization, space is created for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, the process of an organization working as a team to overcome a difficulty may lead to a new, innovative process to meet the needs of customers.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must first foster a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data offer factual evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. They therefore reduce the field of research and confer greater accuracy upon it.
The existing correlation between brain pathology and behavior contributes to scientists' research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we have the possibility to see and investigate structures and processes that occur in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with abundant information and material to develop simulation models, which enhance our understanding of mental processes.
While artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a highly relevant specialty within computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research in the field of AI involves the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include, among others, monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and queries, as well as facial, handwriting, and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial Intelligence systems are now frequently used in the economic, medical, engineering, and military sectors, in much the same way as they were incorporated into various software applications for video games and personal computers.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take their students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution comes through technology, by way of virtual tours. Students can observe objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium, or contemplate beautiful works of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also an excellent way to reflect on an outing and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students at Bennet Elementary School in North Carolina design a webpage about their trip to the state capital, and each year the page is updated, but previous versions are kept online in the form of a scrapbook.
Blogs can also contribute to improving students' writing skills. Even though students often begin their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, this generally changes in the presence of an audience.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Likewise, blogging "demands that students be more understanding of the world around them." The need to spark the audience's interest inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspires collaboration and encourages students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The proper use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through active response to internet content, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, in addition to establishing their perspectives on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's captivating bilingual capital, boasting a variety of museums and art galleries that showcase the country's history and present.
Niagara Falls is further south, while the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and the expanse that follows it.
All these aspects, among others, are what highlight Ontario as intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are wilderness, almost uninhabited.
To make a population comparison that greatly surprises many: more African Americans live in the United States than Canadians.
The location of the East African islands is off the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands constitute independent states or are associated with France, and they are popular for their beaches and luxury resorts.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and was largely imposed in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial kick-off of European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama of the route linking the Cape of Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north, and by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: All female visitors are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be useful to wear a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it's not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to defend your position (whether cultural differences exist or not, that's not right!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name Casa Branca, but in 1755 they abandoned it after an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan Sultan with the name Daru l-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who set up their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in all of Morocco to go shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, there are many places where traditional Moroccan items are sold, such as earthenware pots, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes, and a whole range of trinkets, although everything is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist destination in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the eastern border, near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the city center.
While Goma itself is relatively safe, any travel outside the city should be carefully considered in order to be aware of the ongoing clashes in the North Kivu province.
In turn, the city is the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and its mountain gorilla trekking excursions are among the most affordable in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can choose to take a boda-boda (mototaxi). The regular (local) fare is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, coupled with its relative inaccessibility, has given "Timbuktu" an image of an exotic and faraway land.
Although Timbuktu is an impoverished city today, it still has an airport, and its reputation makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops on Henry Louis Gates' "African World Wonders" special on PBS.
The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each of which supports different wildlife.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as a main icon of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all nature reserves in South Africa, there are daily conservation and park access fees.
It may also be convenient to buy a Wild Card, which allows entry to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of the country's National Parks.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the eponymous island, which is considered the main attraction by many tourists.
The deployment of buildings that define Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a luminous bar graph accentuated by the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront, located opposite.
It is on the reclaimed lands of Hong Kong's north coast that its urban development is densely concentrated.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you want to see evidence of this region's colonial past, it is a convenient place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coastlines of Bangladesh and India.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The section of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Notwithstanding the above, the forests are not just mangroves, but also hold some of the last remaining trees of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans comprise an area of 3850 km2, and about one-third of their extension is covered by water or swampy areas.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those traveling east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Because buses between districts are often crowded with passengers, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Almost all districts have the service of Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the river, connecting Oiapoque, a Brazilian city, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m wide.
Underneath the bridge there is a clearance of 15 meters, and although its construction was finished in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
Full operation of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is when the Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The area that currently constitutes eastern Paraguay was inhabited by the Guaraní, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and lived as semi-nomadic hunters, as well as practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, for example, the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered, and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," was born in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and native indigenous peoples.
The Spanish initiated the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was established in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve a good part of its idiosyncrasy and aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo grounds.
Other tournaments and minor matches can also be witnessed at other times of the year.
On the Argentine Polo Association website, you can find information about tournaments and where to purchase tickets for polo matches.
The value of the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed at parity with the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. You can exchange your money there. It is opposite the FIC West store in Stanley.
Pounds Sterling are generally accepted anywhere within the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
There's a chance that credit cards won't be accepted on the outlying islands, but British or US currency might be usable. Ask the owners in advance to clarify which payment methods are accepted.
It is practically impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the archipelago, therefore, make sure to do so before you leave.
Because Montevideo is located south of Ecuador, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures exceeding +30°C during the summer.
The winter cold can be deceiving: while temperatures rarely drop below freezing, the wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specifically "rainy" or "dry" seasons; the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
While many of the park's animals are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild, so it should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities' instructions, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals.
Regardless of how docile they may appear, the truth is that bison, elk, moose, bears, and practically all large animals can be aggressive.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year for failing to keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous; therefore, respect their space.
Also, remember that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so you should avoid having or cooking foods that release a lot of aroma, and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa, the city of Apia is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval standoff when seven German, American, and British ships refused to leave the harbor.
They sank all the ships, except for a British cruiser. About two hundred American and German individuals died.
During the war for independence faced by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the assassination of head of state Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a large number of beaches, due to the fact that Auckland has two harbors. The best-known ones are located in three areas.
In the North Harbour district, in the Pacific Ocean, lie the North Shore beaches, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are almost all sandy with safe swimming areas, and most have pohutukawa trees that offer shady spots.
In the Waitemata Harbour, the beaches of Tamaki Drive unfold, in the extravagant neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland.
These are family-friendly beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available along the coast. They are also safe for swimming.
Number One is the most popular local beer and it's not complex, but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other regional beer is Manta.
While there is a great variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia could be considered better for transporting.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you're concerned, you can easily find bottled water.
Australians consider the notion of the "flat white" coffee to be foreign. A small black coffee is called an "espresso," cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam), and tea is not taken with milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Numerous trips to the reef take place throughout the year, and injuries there from any of these causes are rare.
Anyway, follow the advice of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay special attention to safety alerts.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April, north of 1770. Occasionally, they can be found outside of this period.
Sharks do exist, but they almost never attack people. Most of them are afraid of people and would swim away.
The ocean is not where saltwater crocodiles actively reside. Their primary habitat is the river estuaries located north of Rockhampton.
Reserving accommodation in advance of your trip gives you the peace of mind knowing that you'll have a place to sleep when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although it is also possible to book other types of accommodation through them, such as campsites.
Travel agents generally offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even combined flight and accommodation deals.
They can also hold the reservation for you in case you need time to think the offer over, or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
However, any modification or request must be made through the travel agent first, and not directly through the hotel.
At some festivals, most of those who attend the musical events choose to camp on-site, and the majority of spectators consider it a crucial aspect of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close, then you should arrive at the campsite early to secure a spot near the musical events.
It should be noted that, while the musical performances may have finished, activities in other areas of the festival could continue until the early hours of the morning.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of your cabin, as traversing the ice generates a very annoying noise for those most affected.
During cruises to St. Petersburg, time is also spent in the city. Those disembarking are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize the time and money their customers spend. Usually, there are no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They often offer special promotions on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and on the premises.
Some establishments offer free alcoholic drinks, although intoxication impairs judgment, and every good player knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or mountain passes should anticipate the possibility of snow, ice, or low temperatures.
On roads with ice or snow, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as you do on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, so much snow can fall that you could be trapped in a very short amount of time.
Furthermore, visibility can be reduced by snowfall or by condensation or ice that forms on the car windows.
On the other hand, in many countries ice and snow conditions are normal and traffic flows almost without any interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are likely Africa's biggest tourist draw and the most memorable part for many visitors.
The popular use of the term safari refers to overland journeys to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach vehicles, and the standard equipment will make a good view possible.
Sometimes, lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be shy, so you will have a better chance of observing them using binoculars.
The excursion known as a walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "trek") consists of hiking, whether for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place between August 24th and September 5th, 2021. A number of events will be held in other parts of Japan.
Host of the 1964 sporting event, Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, complications may arise.
There are different types of travel cancellation policies, but since the end of March, the coverage of most of these coronavirus-based policies does not extend to July 2020, which is when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between JPY 2500 and JPY 130,000, with general admission passes costing JPY 7000.
Ironing clothes while they are still damp can help to dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board to lend to travelers, even if one is not in the room.
If you don't have an iron available, or if you don't want to wear ironed stockings, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Try not to let the fabric get too hot, as it could shrink or, in extreme cases, burn.
Various methods are known for purifying water, some of which are more effective at targeting specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others, several minutes are necessary.
Not all filters have the same effectiveness, and if this concerns you, you should consider buying bottled water with a seal from a certified company.
It can happen that travelers encounter animal plagues that are unknown in the regions they come from.
Pests are capable of spoiling food, causing irritation, or, in more serious cases, causing allergic reactions, spreading poison, or transmitting infections.
Infectious diseases, on their own, or dangerous animals, which can injure or kill individuals through the use of their strength, are not usually included in the category of pests.
Duty-free shopping offers an opportunity to purchase products exempt from duties and consumption taxes in certain locations.
Travelers visiting countries with a high tax burden can sometimes save a significant amount of money, particularly on goods such as spirits and tobacco.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions and frequently traverses remote and lonely terrain.
If you don't usually drive on rural roads, stay alert: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on the preceding and following stretches, usually 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence to them is even more important than in any other section.
Nevertheless, and somewhat surprisingly, the cell phone signal is much better here than in many other sections of the highway, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German bakery is of good quality, and in Bavaria, the pastries are quite tasty and varied, similar to those prepared in Austria, its southern neighbor.
Fruit pies are common, with cooked apples inside all year round and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. In general, popular pastries make an excellent combination with a cup of strong coffee.
If you're craving small but delicious pastries, try the Berliner, also called Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a recipe based on herbs and spices and is served with meat or vegetables.
We can find "dry" and "wet" curry, depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland villages of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry. In southern India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly consumed.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian gastronomy is a generic term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines spread throughout the country.
Nevertheless, the term "empleado" without any other qualification tends to refer to the gastronomy originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now available throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of dishes seasoned with simple condiments, with a predominance of Javanese favorite flavors, such as peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are the supports for riders' feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
While they provide greater stability to the rider, they can present safety problems, as it is possible for their feet to get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but a foot remains caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the animal flees. To reduce the risk, there are a number of safety precautions.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel that have a smooth and fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, there are saddles, especially English ones, with safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to detach from its structure if a rider who is thrown pulls backward.
The Cochamó Valley is Chile's most popular climbing destination and is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of extensive granite walls and cliffs.
The summits also offer stunning views from the peaks. Climbers from all corners of the globe are constantly charting new paths among its walls of infinite potential.
Downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular disciplines that involve gliding with skis or a board attached to the feet over snowy terrain.
Skiing is a main travel activity with many followers, sometimes called "ski lovers," who organize their vacations completely based on skiing in a specific location.
The concept of skiing is very old, as there are cave paintings depicting skiers dating back to around 5,000 BC.
As a discipline, alpine skiing dates back to no later than the 17th century. In 1861, Norwegians inaugurated the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski mountaineering: also known as backcountry skiing, cross-country skiing, or ski touring.
Although they are related, it generally does not involve practicing ski touring or alpine-style mountaineering, which are developed on steeply sloping terrain and with much more rigid skis and footwear.
Imagine the ski slope as a hiking trail.
Under satisfactory conditions, it will be able to cover distances slightly longer than on foot, but will very rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a good weight in a backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to manage visa applications and passport controls multiple times.
Nevertheless, the Schengen area functions as a single country in this respect.
Generally, as long as you move within this region, you can cross borders without going through a passport control checkpoint again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to obtain permits for each individual member country of this area separately. This will save you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal criterion that determines when a manufactured good can be considered an antique. Some tax agencies have established that objects older than 100 years are antiques.
The definition varies geographically, where the age limit might be more restricted in places like North America than in Europe.
It can happen that handcrafted products are classified as antiques, even if they are newer than mass-produced goods of similar characteristics.
Reindeer husbandry is a vital livelihood among the Sami people, and the culture associated with this trade is important to many who are engaged in other professions.
Even so, even traditionally, not all Sami people have engaged in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather lived off fishing, hunting, and other similar activities, using reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sami people work in modern commercial activities. Tourism represents a significant income in Lapland, the Sami region.
Although it is used extensively, especially among non-Romani people, the term "gitano" often carries an offensive connotation, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions about Romani people.
If your destination country is subject to a travel advisory, this could affect your medical or trip cancellation insurance.
It's possible that you might want to consult the recommendations of other governments, but they are intended for their own citizens.
For example, an American visitor in the Middle East might face different situations than a European or an Arab.
Travel advisories are just a concise summary of the political situation in another country.
The viewpoints presented are often superficial, generic, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
The term severe weather generally refers to any hazardous weather phenomenon capable of causing damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere on the planet, and there are different types depending on the geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Hurricanes, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are types and consequences of extreme weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, or cyclones.
Among the extreme regional and seasonal climatic phenomena, we find strong winds, snowstorms, ice storms, or dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to inform themselves about any risk of extreme weather in the area they are visiting, as this may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning a trip to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
It is likely that searching for "Course on Hostile Zones" online will lead you to the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will cover all the topics that have been discussed here in much more detail and, generally, with practical experience.
A course typically lasts between 2 and 5 days and includes role-playing, first aid, and even, on occasion, weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are scarce.
Passengers who have scheduled gender reassignment surgery in another country should ensure they carry valid documentation for their return trip.
Governments hold varied positions regarding the possibility of issuing passports without a gender declaration (X) or updated documents to match a person's name with the gender with which they identify.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies greatly.
Security checkpoint screenings have become more invasive since 9/11.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to go through scanners with their dignity and privacy intact.
Rip currents are the flow of water rushing back out to sea from waves breaking on the shore, often near a reef or similar structure.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow gathers in certain deeper areas, and a fast current can originate there, heading towards deep water.
Most deaths occur due to the fatigue caused by trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once I manage to escape the current, swimming back won't be any more difficult than usual.
Try to get somewhere out of reach again, or, if you have the skills and someone has seen you, it might be wise to wait for rescue.
The impact of returning home happens before the cultural one (there's no "honeymoon" period of happiness), takes longer to go away, and can be tougher.
Travelers who easily adapted to a new culture sometimes have great difficulty readjusting to their native culture.
When they return home after living abroad, they will have adapted to that new culture and will have lost some of the habits of their native culture.
When you traveled abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, as they knew that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
People may not foresee that tolerance and understanding are also necessary for returning travelers in their own homes.
The light show and pyramidal sound are one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
In the darkness, you can see the pyramids and contemplate them in silence before the show begins.
Generally, you'll be able to hear the sound of tourists and vendors at all times. The story of sound and light resembles a storybook.
The sphinx appears as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and all of them are illuminated.
The discovery of the South Shetland Islands occurred in 1819, and several nations lay claim to them. They have the largest number of bases, reaching sixteen active ones in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsular territory. The largest island is King George Island, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where there is a spectacular natural harbor formed by the flooded caldera of a volcano that remains active.
Ellsworth Land, whose boundaries are defined by the Bellingshausen Sea, is a region located south of the peninsula.
In this place, the mountains of the Peninsula mix with the plateau and then re-emerge to form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, fractured in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern sector, Sentinel Range, are found the highest peaks in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a summit at 4892 meters on Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, where cellular phone coverage doesn't reach, a satellite device might be your only option.
A satellite phone cannot be compared to a mobile phone because, to make a call, you must be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
The service is typically used in water transport, including recreational craft, as well as for expeditions that require remote data and voice.
You can check with your local phone service provider for more information on how to subscribe to this service.
Combining travel and learning has become a very popular option among those planning to take a gap year.
This is very popular among high school graduates, as it allows them to take a gap year before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a study abroad program during a gap year can, in fact, increase the chances of accessing higher education once you return to your home country.
Typically, a registration fee will be charged to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for sailing: the "land of a thousand lakes" also boasts thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't always need a yacht in archipelagos and lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are wide enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a popular recreational activity nationwide in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
The same is true in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but, apart from that, it's quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Most exclusive cruises through the Baltic Sea include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you have the possibility to visit the historic city for a few full days during your return trip, sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only disembark during shore excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Berlin, Germany, appears in the brochures of some cruises. However, as can be seen on the map above, this city is not located near the sea and its visit is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can cause fear in people of any age and place, particularly if they have never had the experience or if they have lived through a traumatic situation.
You shouldn't feel ashamed of it: it's no different from other types of personal fears and dislikes that plague so many others.
For some, understanding a little about how airplanes operate and what happens during a flight can make it easier to overcome a fear that stems from a lack of knowledge or the feeling of not being in control.
Courier companies are paid very well for making fast deliveries. Frequently, time is very important when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
Large companies have their own planes on some routes, but there was a problem for smaller businesses and other routes.
If they shipped by air freight, on some routes there may have been delays of days in unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to make it faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations prohibit transporting luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to travel in first class or business class on a plane is to spend a fortune for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company pay for it).
But this comes at a price: generally speaking, you can end up paying up to four times more than the economy fare in business class, and up to eleven times more in first class.
It's generally a waste of time to look for discounts on first-class or business-class seats on direct flights.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. Its regional language is Romanian, although Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a republic composed of many ethnicities, among which conflicts of that nature have arisen.
In 1994, this conflict led to the formation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria, east of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but which no UN member state recognizes.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between the two parts of Moldova have been re-established.
Orthodox Christianity is the majority religion in Moldova.
Izmir is the third most important city in Turkey, with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
What once was the ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, evolved, and bustling commercial metropolis, established around a sprawling bay and surrounded by mountains.
Both the expansive boulevards and the buildings with mirrored facades and the cutting-edge shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red-tile roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches. Even so, its atmosphere is more akin to Mediterranean Europe than to traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers excursions to the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures in the shape of doves on some of the tombs.
It's worth spending half an hour taking a walk through the fascinating town.
To the north and within easy reach lies the romantic and stunning city of Sintra, which gained popularity among foreigners following a vivid account of its splendors by Lord Byron.
On Scotturb, bus 403 regularly goes to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
You should also visit, to the north, the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima (Santuario), a site where apparitions of the Virgin Mary occurred, famous throughout the world.
Do not forget that, fundamentally, you are visiting a place that served as a mass grave and that is also a site of practically invaluable significance for an important part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time in this place, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked there until their death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Give the place all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazism.
Do not deface the site by making marks or graffiti on the structures.
Catalan and Spanish are the official languages of Barcelona. Approximately half of its people prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, because Catalan is legally the primary official language, most of the signs are written only in that language.
Even so, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other buildings.
While regular announcements in the Metro are only displayed in Catalan, unplanned disruptions are announced in a wide variety of languages through an automated program, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and conceited.
Although often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to have a good time in Paris is to behave as well as possible, like a *bien élevé* (well-mannered) person. This will make getting around much easier.
A few courteous gestures from you will quickly dispel the perceived rudeness of Parisians.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is very wooded, mainly featuring beeches, firs, and spruces, and exhibits vegetation that is both alpine and Mediterranean.
It possesses a wide and extraordinary array of plant communities, thanks to the variety of microclimates, soils, and altitude levels.
This region is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
The European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the capercaillie are some of the exotic animals, among many other common creatures, that can be found in the area.
During visits to monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and cannot have bare shoulders.
While almost all monasteries provide shawls to women who arrive unprepared, if you bring your own, especially if it's brightly colored, the monk or nun will smile at you at the entrance.
Following the same line, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
This can also be borrowed from the garments available upon entry, but that clothing is not washed after each person uses it, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all for men!
The cuisine of Mallorca, like that of other similar regions of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in all its recipes.
Pa amb Oli is a popular and simple dinner, especially common in the summer. It's bread with olive oil, tomato, and any other ingredient like cheese or tuna, among others.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie to mean 'you' (formal), are always capitalized, even when they are in the middle of a sentence.
It is a key method for differentiating between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be said that it simplifies reading, although its writing is somewhat complex, since it is necessary to determine whether a verb or adjective is being used in a substantivized form.
Pronouncing Italian is relatively straightforward, given that most of its words sound the same as they are written.
C and G are the letters you need to be most careful with, as they are pronounced differently depending on the vowel that follows them.
Likewise, be sure to respect the difference in the pronunciation of the r and the rr. For example, "caro" means expensive, while "carro" means car.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar manual will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar rules and achieve a better understanding of phrases.
It is not necessary to clarify that, if you are fluent in any Romance language, you will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak some Spanish may jump to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and that it is unnecessary to study it separately.
Nowadays, pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete and remain functioning as museums or educational destinations.
Since light pollution was not as significant a problem in their heyday as it is today, it's common to find them in cities or on campuses, making them more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most current research telescopes consist of immense structures installed in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, called hanami, has been a Japanese tradition since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where the plum blossom was the most prized.
It was the Emperor of Japan who organized the first cherry blossom celebrations, only for himself and other members of the Imperial Court aristocracy.
Plants look their best in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to uproot "just one" specimen.
Collecting "specimens" during a visit to a formally organized garden will get you expelled, no questions asked.
Generally, Singapore is a very safe place to be and very easy to get around; furthermore, you can buy almost any product from the moment you arrive.
But, due to its location in the "high tropics," a few degrees north of the equator, you will always have to deal with the heat and, when the sky is clear, with the strong sun, which happens less often.
Furthermore, some buses head towards Hebron, to the north, which is the site where, according to history, the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives were buried.
You should confirm that the bus you intend to board is going to Hebron and not just to Kiryat Arba, which is a Jewish neighborhood near that location.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for vacations.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, taking a cruise to interesting destinations along the Danube, or boating along the Erie Canal.
They also mark the routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
For the Christian religion, Christmas is one of its most important holidays, in which the birth of Jesus Christ is celebrated.
Numerous traditions related to this holiday have been incorporated by both believers and non-believers from Christian and non-Christian countries around the globe.
It is traditional to spend Easter night awake in an exposed place to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches usually offer an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, and congregations generally begin the celebrations for the resurrection of Christ as soon as midnight arrives.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came to this place swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to their great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to reach them, which led to the giant tortoise becoming the primary grazing creature in the Galapagos.
Many mammalian species have been introduced to the Galapagos since humans arrived in the archipelago, such as goats, horses, and cattle, or rodents, dogs, and cats.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
Given that the sky will remain dark for almost the entire day, it's a great opportunity to view the aurora borealis.
Thanks to the sparse population residing in these regions and the resulting lack of light pollution, you can also delight in the stars.
In Japan, the work culture has a more vertical and formal structure than Westerners are likely accustomed to.
Typical business attire consists of suits, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is essential, where group efforts are emphasized over focusing on praise for individual achievements.
Frequently, workers must have the approval of their superiors for decision-making and are expected to obey their instructions without question.
