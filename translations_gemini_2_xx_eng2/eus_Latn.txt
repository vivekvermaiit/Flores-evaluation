That confirms the theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers and, furthermore, shows some details that fossils generally cannot provide, including color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was chestnut-colored on the upper side and of carotenoid color or pale color on the underside.
The discovery also provides details about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed vane (called a rachis), but they do have other features of feathers (barbs); therefore, researchers have concluded that the rachis evolved later than these other features.
From the structure of the feathers, it can be deduced that they were not used for flying, but rather for regulating temperature or changing appearance. According to the researchers' proposal, even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage, not the down of a hatchling.

Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy exists as a halo around the galaxy and is made up of numerous small particles.

Doctor Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
According to what was mentioned in an interview, the new variant is "very worrying and serious, because it has a very high mortality rate."

In France, the voting procedure is usually a low-tech experience: those who have to vote enter a booth, take a paper with the pre-printed name of the candidate they have chosen, and put it in an envelope.

Candidates may send representatives to observe all parts of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes, strictly guarded and following precise procedures.

Uka's weapon misfired when aiming at the fifth person's head. Schneider continues to suffer, he is blind in one eye, he is missing a piece of his skull, and part of his face has been rebuilt with titanium.
Schneider testified via video call from a USAF base in his town.
In addition to Wednesday's event, Carpanedo participated in two other individual races in the Championship.
The first test was slalom, and she didn't finish the course on the first run. In that race, 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result.
In the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's seated category with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind Austria's Claudia Loesch, who finished in first place, and 1:09.02 minutes behind Hungary's Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth.
Four members of the women's seated team failed to finish the descent, and 45 of the 117 skiers who participated in the giant slalom failed to qualify.
Madhya Pradesh police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
D K Arya, Deputy Inspector General, said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her laptop and mobile phone."
These are the accused: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared before the judge with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of the three were injured.
However, the driver has serious head injuries.
The road, which was the scene of the accident, was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterwards, he/she/they were taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital (Cambridge).
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court accused of murdering her son.
He is in custody awaiting the complaint and trial, but it is likely that the witnesses' evidence will not be entirely credible because his image has been published in many places.
It is common practice to do so in Great Britain, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts believe that publishing photos could be harmful.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, "journalists walk a fine line when they publish photos of suspects and so on."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for complaints, has told journalists that it will not comment further until a complaint has been made.
According to the leak, the document concerns a border dispute, in which it is mentioned that Palestine wants to restore the borders that existed before the 1967 Six-Day War.
According to reports, other topics covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants the military to remain in the valley for the ten years following the signing of the agreement; Palestine, on the other hand, wants to limit the stay to five years.
The forest rangers closely monitored the hunters who were testing the complementary pest control, as they were tracking the test and evaluating its effectiveness.
In collaboration with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were selected as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, NPWS Executive Director of Park Conservation and Heritage, said that the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training guidelines.
Martelly swore in the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEO in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the existing CEP should resign, as one of the measures the country should take on the way to holding new elections.
Martelly created the commission to respond to the spread of protests against the regime, which began in October.
Several protests arose, sometimes violent, due to the inability to organize elections that had not been held since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPods malfunctioning and overheating have been reported; in total, they have caused six fires, and four people have suffered minor burns.
According to Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), they have received reports of 27 incidents related to the device.
Over the past week, METI reported that Apple received 34 more cases of overheating, which the company said were "minor".
The Ministry responded by saying that Apple's delay in reporting the cases was "utterly regrettable".
The earthquake shook the Marianas at 07:19 local time (GMT 21:19, Friday).
The emergency management office of the Northern Marianas has stated that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has confirmed that there have been no tsunami signals.
A former Philippine police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, after hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Some hostages have been rescued and at least six deaths have already been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman, as she needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and studied medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his free time.
According to the research conducted, the fetal lungs of the baby matured faster if a hormone was administered.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered the two 'black boxes' that recorded the flight on Wednesday.
Luna was also honored by her fellow fighters.
According to Tommy Dreamer, "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a two-moon night. A special night, just like her. A strong woman."
According to Dustin "Goldust" Runnels, "Luna was as freaky as me... maybe even more so... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Before the 2010 federal election, a survey was conducted among 1,400 people; and since 2008, the number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percentage points.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the people who answered the survey share the same opinion, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
Having won an Olympic gold medal, he was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle events and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness is in doubt due to the pains he has mentioned.
He hasn't been able to take the medication he needs for pain relief because they are prohibited at the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, discovered the largest known prime number.
By early February, several people had verified the discovery using various hardware and software, and the discovery was announced on Tuesday.
It is likely that comets were one of the sources that supplied Earth with water, as well as one of the sources of organic matter that could create proteins and help life develop.
Scientists want to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth was created; indeed, long ago, stellar embryos collided with the Earth.
Cuomo (53) began his work as governor at the beginning of this year, and he signed the bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
According to him, the rumors are "political talk and nonsense".
He has made mention of potentially running in the 2016 presidential election.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology as opposed to outdated ground-based radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no extra transport and overground trains will not stop at Wembley. There is no car parking or park and ride facility available outside.
Fearing the lack of transport, he put on the table the possibility of having to play the match without fans or team supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported that a new species of bird was emerging in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden say that a new species has emerged in two generations, although it was believed that this process took much longer; in fact, Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortis) and the immigrant cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris) have interbred.
Gold can be given any shape. It can be curled until tiny shapes are made.
It can be drawn until it becomes a thin wire; it can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered, or flattened until it becomes a sheet.
It can be made into a thin layer and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to embellish hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
That is called the pH of a chemical compound. You can make an indicator using red cabbage water.
Cabbage water changes color depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical compound.
The pH level indicates how many hydrogen ions (the H in pH) are present in the chemical compound used for the test.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (in fact, a proton and an electron make up a hydrogen atom).
Mix the two dry powders together and squeeze with clean, damp hands until a ball forms.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, giving a unique sensation, and something like a shell will form.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost all houses had a toilet that flushed water, connected to a sophisticated wastewater system.
Traces of wastewater systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, and men and women were together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it downwards almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by means of a spacecraft. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A spacecraft taller than 100 feet is needed to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an amazing way. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to allow us to transport things more easily and quickly.
He/She/It has brought us the train, the car, and many other transportation devices.
Below them are mid-sized cats that eat mid-sized prey, from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many other small cats (including domesticated cats) that eat smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds, which are more abundant.
The secret to their success lies in the concept of niche. Each type of cat performs a specific task, so they don't have to compete with the others.
Lions are the most social of the cats, and they usually live in large groups.
Lion prides typically consist of one to three males and up to thirty females and cubs.
Females have a closer relationship with each other, forming a large family made up of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides function in a similar way to wolf or dog packs; they are very similar in terms of behavior to lions (but are not like other big cats) and are very dangerous to prey.
The tiger is a very good athlete, it can climb (even if it doesn't do it very well), swim, make big jumps, and pull with five times more strength than a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group as the lion, panther, and jaguar (Panthera genus). These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's loud roar; it's more like a sentence made up of shouted, threatening words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, if possible. Almost all the animals that ocelots catch are smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots use their sense of smell to track and find the animals they will eat (prey), by smelling tracks on the ground.
Having night vision, they see very well at night and are also able to move very quietly. Ocelots hide in their environment and catch prey by surprise by jumping on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the original main population (for example, by moving across a mountain range or a river, or by being unable to easily return from a new island), it will often find itself in an environment unlike the one before.
That environment has different resources and competitors, and therefore, the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it previously needed to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, as they still need the same adaptations they needed before.
As time progresses, the new population begins to adapt to the new environment and has less and less resemblance to the original population.
Eventually, after thousands, or perhaps millions, of years, the two populations will be so different from each other that they will not be able to be designated with the same species name.
We call that process speciation; it simply means the creation of a new species. Speciation is inevitable; it is an important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, the carbon dioxide they exhale when breathing).
Plants feed themselves with the help of the sun, through photosynthesis. Furthermore, they also provide shade.
We make houses with parts of plants, and also clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time; therefore, it feared no one, except perhaps other mosasaurs.
It had a long jaw, filled with 70 sharp teeth, and another set of teeth on the palate; therefore, nothing that crossed its path would have any way to escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may also have had a forked tongue. Turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs were part of its diet, and it is believed that it may have also been cannibalistic.
Moreover, it would attack anything that entered the water; even a large T. Rex dinosaur would not be an opponent of its caliber.
Although most Roman food is familiar to us, they also had strange or unusual dishes for banquets, including wild boar, poultry, snails, or a rodent called muxarra.
Another difference was that poor people and women ate food sitting down, while wealthy men ate feasts together reclining on their sides.
The ancient Romans could not eat foods that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they didn't have corn, nor tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa either, and the ancient Romans didn't taste turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each god, and they considered it to be the god's house.
People made sacrifices to the god, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by performing ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, as well as an inner sanctuary, which only priests could use.
Sometimes they built pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the mild climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The greatest part of the Hebrew family's life took place in the open air.
The women were preparing food in the courtyard; the shops were open displays facing the street. They used stone to build the houses.
There were not many forests in the land of Canaan, and therefore wood was very expensive.
There haven't been many settlements in Greenland. Scandinavian sagas mention that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for a murder, and that traveling further west he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there.

If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you probably think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even if there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, these words are written: "Declaration of Independence, original, dated July 4, 1776." The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but it is known that the large parchment document was initially rolled up for storage (it measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches).
Therefore, it's likely the note was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
The "Vichy" French were in power. They were the French who agreed to peace with the Germans in 1940, those who worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France through an invasion called "Operation Dragoon".
In two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and began moving towards Germany.
Civilization is the name given to a distinctive culture shared by a significant group of people who live together and work cooperatively, as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis. This means civil and is related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and the word civitas, which means city or city-state, and at the same time, it defines the size of a society in some way.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A culture that has civilization means that knowledge is passed down through generations, there is a cultural footprint, and fair expansion is carried out.
Cultures of a lower level disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and are not recognized as civilizations.
In the War of Independence, the first thirteen states formed a weak central government, with Congress as its only component, and it was subject to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, the authorities of the states had the power to enforce its laws, although they often did not help.
Furthermore, it did not have the power to invalidate tax laws or charges between states.
Before they could have the chance to amend articles which needed the unanimous consent of all states, and the states took the central government with such ease that their representatives often did not even appear.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful football team in the world, and they were the winners of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Among the most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
In the northern regions, winter sports are the most practiced, and Italians compete in international games and the Olympics.
Japan has around 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which is why Japan is the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to the multitude of islands Japan has, it is geographically designated as an "archipelago."
The beginnings in Taiwan are located in the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and named it Ilha Formosa, beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established itself in southwestern Taiwan and began to transform the agricultural activities of the indigenous people, as well as employing Chinese laborers to work on the rice and sugar plantations there.
In 1683, the army of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) seized the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan, and Taiwan was designated a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which Taiwan was ceded to Japan, which would rule the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to show tourists what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and they are still continuing to restore it.
For example, in still photography, the 35 mm format is the most common in the world, as that film size was dominant at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but, more importantly, the formats of image sensors in digital cameras have followed its proportions.
Indeed, although it's confusing, the 35mm format actually has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The proportion of this format (which is divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio), is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format families) have this same or similar aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, an often overused and ridiculed technique, is a simple guide for creating dynamism in an image while maintaining a sense of order.
According to the rules, the most effective places to position the main subject are the points where the lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds intersect (see example).
During that period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, began to be rigorously scrutinized.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united the states of Europe, despite their different languages and customs.
His omnipotent power affected everyone, from the king to the common citizens.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the Church's funds are specifically for that purpose.
The Church's central authority was established in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether that principle was being fulfilled.
Immediately after the onslaught erupted, Britain began blockading Germany's ships.
Stopping the entry of basic military and civilian supplies was an effective strategy, but this blockade violated international law, codified and generally accepted through numerous international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters, preventing ships from accessing large parts of the ocean and endangering even neutral vessels.
Since this tactic received a limited response, Germany hoped that its unrestricted submarine warfare would also receive a similar response.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude in most cities and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
Having experienced the horrors and cruelty of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States of America to start working at the Edison company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation addressed to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his former workplace manager).
Ancient China had a unique way of showcasing each era. Each era of China, or each family that held power, was a distinct dynasty.
In addition, in the interval between dynasties, there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most well-known of these eras was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those times, cruel wars took place between nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history; thousands of people died fighting for the right to sit in the highest seats of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are several social and political influences: for example, the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country should belong to the inhabitants rather than a single ruler.
After the revolution, jobs were placed in the hands of all men, allowing those with the most ambition and success to advance.
The same thing happened with the military, since rank in the army was now based on calibre, rather than on class.
Moreover, the French Revolution inspired the working classes in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a keen interest in matters beyond everyday life. He often went to a cave to contemplate; the place was called "Hira", and it was on the mountain "Noor" (light).
The cave, which has endured through time, clearly demonstrates Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
The cave on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca is completely isolated from the world.
Even knowing the location, it is not easy to find. Inside the cave, the solitude is complete.
Only the clear and beautiful sky above and the surrounding mountains can be seen. Little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven ancient wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of the large pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis," located in the Egyptian Valley of Death, contains several pyramids, smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx (and the Great Pyramid is the largest of them all).
The great pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and smaller pyramids, tombs, and many temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "move the arc up" mark is V-shaped, while the "move the arc down" mark is shaped like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
Going up means you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and going down means you have to start at the base (where you hold the bow) and pull from the bow.
An upward bow movement produces a softer sound, while a downward movement creates a stronger and more compact sound.
You can make your own markings with a pencil, but printed bow markings are placed for musical reasons, and should therefore be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister Elizabeth were terrified when a large group of market women forced them to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, accompanied by a noisy crowd shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to have the carriage windows completely open.
At one point, a member of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The war expenses that US imperialism incurred in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay a large part of the expenses to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States and the interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the profits derived from the long exploitation of Filipinos were the fundamental profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
That period of events is called the High Middle Ages in European history, and it encompasses the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (years 1000-1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages came before the High Middle Ages, and after that, the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism encompasses many ideas in practice; be it the impulse or necessity caused by technology, or the belief that humanity's fate is guided by a hidden logic dependent on scientific laws (and the way they manifest in technology).
Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general ideas in common: on the one hand, that technological development transcends any political or cultural power, and, on the other hand, that technology simultaneously has an "impact" on societies on its own, more than societies have on technology.
For example, it could be said that having motor vehicles inevitably leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable if there are only a few cars; therefore, new production methods are being developed to make cars more affordable.
The more widespread car ownership is, the more accidents happen on the roads; but, that in turn, leads to the creation of new techniques for treating the injured in the healthcare sector.
Romanticism had an important element of cultural determinism derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography molded individuals, and as time progressed, customs and cultures associated with that geography arose. Since the latter were in harmony with the place of society, they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the modern world, we consider Paris the capital of fashion, but in feudal Europe, Constantinople was the center.
It began to be the epicenter of luxury around 400 AD, and its fame lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its prestige diminished in the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders, upon their return, brought silk fabrics and spices as gifts, and these goods had a higher value than what was offered in the Byzantine markets.
At that time, Constantinople ceased to be the capital of fashion, in favor of Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style occurred between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the clothes had a great influence from the culture of Eastern Byzantium.
However, because communication channels were slow, styles arrived in the West with a delay of 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest innovations of that era came when the Crusaders began using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is the type of agriculture that is done to produce enough food to meet the needs of farmers and their families.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses saved seeds and crop rotation or similar simple techniques specific to the ecoregion to obtain the largest possible harvest.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who have a similar way of thinking and feel outside the standards of society, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
There are many ways to distinguish subcultures, such as age, ethnicity, class, location, or gender.
The characteristics that define a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture make a distinctive and symbolic use of style to show their membership, which includes fashion, idiosyncrasies, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is the unfortunate cases of children who, while growing up, due to neglect, misfortune, or explicit abuse, did not have the opportunity to socialize with adults.
Those children are called "feral." Some feral children were locked up by people (usually their parents), while in other cases, children were abandoned by their parents because they did not accept a child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
It is likely that feral children experienced severe abuse or trauma in childhood before being abandoned, left alone, or escaping.
Others, supposedly, were raised by animals; still others, it is said, lived on their own in nature.
In cases of feral children raised by non-human animals, they often exhibit behaviors that are almost identical to that particular caregiver animal (within physical limitations), such as fear or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning makes the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding methods go a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a way to support those immersed in a new learning experience, which is necessary, for example, when using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or real; in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, as is the Microsoft Office Clippy.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software, providing questions, notes, and explanations about procedures that students may find difficult to manage on their own.
Children entering care are there for a variety of reasons, such as neglect, abuse, or blackmail.
Children should not have to grow up in environments that do not support, care for, and educate them, but such things happen.
In our opinion, the Foster Care System is a safe space for children like these.
Our reception system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The welcome must provide all the needs that were lacking in the homes they left behind.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
Thanks to the diverse characteristics of the internet, complementary aspects related to usage and satisfaction have been enabled.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are said to be the main motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998), when investigating people's reaction to websites, also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" as motivational aspects.
Important discoveries have been made using video recordings in interpreting microexpressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is said that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, one can detect whether a person is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks, in the President's speech in a scientific article, stated that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to accurately perceive sincerity.
According to him, this ability to interpret human behavior is also present in other animals, such as domesticated dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variations: hidden ones and expressed ones.
Mutations add new genetic variants, while selection removes them from the pool of expressed variants.
Segregation and recombination transfer variants from one set to another in each generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to obtain the necessary amino acids from the available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to obtain it can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and, ultimately, death.
The most accessible plant-based resources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest when they are unprepared.
On the other hand, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs), in addition to being easy to digest, contain high-quality proteins that have all the essential amino acids.
Taking everything into account, it shouldn't be surprising to learn that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a similar way to how savannah chimpanzees do today.
During the sleep fragmentation process, you are deliberately awakened during normal sleep and then fall asleep again shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
That can be easily achieved by using a gentle alarm that keeps you conscious but doesn't fully wake you up.
If you reset the alarm while you're still asleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Among the options based on biorhythms, another is to drink plenty of fluids before sleeping (especially water or tea, as it is a known diuretic), to force yourself to wake up to urinate.
The inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The less tension, the more positive life force there is. Every person has the power to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
We can all achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle on the path to achieving that is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded with the Mahayana path of compassion and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It has, as components, the path of love that encompasses Kundalini yoga, meditation, and everything.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yogic postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Tibetan meditation's core is deity yoga. By visualizing various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment arises.
Germany was the enemy of many in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war ended, due to clashes in systems, processes, and culture, the countries grew apart.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
The war lasted the next 40 years, and there were real struggles, through army representatives, from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defenses were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize through the Romanian bridgehead.
However, almost overnight these plans became obsolete when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
Maritime operations have traditionally involved maintaining a nation's ability to move people and goods, while simultaneously hindering an adversary's ability to do the same.
The most notable example of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans were trying to send men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
Similarly, the German navy used U-boats to stop that traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have been able to conquer Great Britain, just as it did with the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising goats to easily obtain milk, hair, meat, and leather.
They were usually kept in goat herds, which grazed on hills or other grazing areas, under the care of goatherds, who were children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known shepherds. These shepherding methods are still used today.
In England, they were already building organ roads in the 16th century.
Although the trackways were nothing more than parallel wooden planks, thanks to being dragged by horses, they could gain greater speed on the rough roads of the time and carry heavier loads.
Washers were added fairly early on to fix the rails. Gradually, however, they realized that the rails would be more effective if they had a strip of iron on top.
It became common, but due to the iron, the wooden wheels of the carts wore out more quickly.
Finally, they replaced the wooden wheels with iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were used.
The earliest known form of transportation is walking; in fact, humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright human).
Their preceding australopithecines did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specialization has been found in fossils of australopithecines dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, but it is possible that Sahelanthropus also walked on two feet seven million years ago.
We can start living in a cleaner way with respect to the environment, we can join environmental mobilizations, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, it's like symptomatic treatment. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems in order to solve them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and that problems have increased due to overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle of humanity.
After being approved by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by John Hancock, President of the Congress, and Charles Thomson, the Secretary, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, which was nearby.
Those known as the "Dunlap broadsides" were made in between 150 and 200 copies that night.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the garden of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of the copies was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he had it read to his army on July 9th in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The oldest surviving copies of the document are the 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many people don't imagine them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and fly.
But many characteristics of birds are similar to those of dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information, which is encoded with binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, for example 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (or, in computer jargon, bits).
Food poisoning might not be immediately obvious. Because vomiting and other symptoms are too general, an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
An open container of medication or toxic household cleaning chemicals is the best indicator of intestinal poisoning.
Read the label to know what the first aid measures are for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "zimitza" to name that group of insects.
They are named after their similarities to bedbugs in the past, as they have a great capacity to be parasites of humans.
The assassin bug and the bed bug are both nidicolous, and they are accustomed to living in nests and on hosts.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
According to research, women are twice as likely to have AD compared to men.
It may happen that a couple decides that raising a baby is not the best thing for them or for the child.
That couple might make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
Using the scientific method, the main goal of science is to understand how the world works. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
In any case, experimentation is not the only thing that needs to be done; likewise, an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, by asking questions, and observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including philosophy, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek diminished, the West became estranged from its Greek philosophical and scientific origins.
The existence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks is crucial for the many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living things: bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that continue to function for a period on their own, even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence proving that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to inject their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments: they labeled the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or they labeled the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have diverse effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the portion of genetic material it affects, and whether the cells they affect are germline cells or not.
Only mutations in germline cells are passed on to children, and mutations in other locations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas, who go with the aim of enjoying the landscape (including fauna and flora).
Some examples of in situ activities include: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
Visiting Bornean orangutans, taking their pictures, and learning about them, for example.
Every morning, people leave the small villages in the rural areas to go to work and cross paths with the people who work in the place they have just left.
Within that transport dynamic, the whole world is somehow tied to and defends a transport system based on private cars.
According to science, this enormous carbon economy has altered the stable state of the biosphere over the last two million years, which has supported human evolution.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you very rarely hear so many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints? Why do they fail every day? Are transport technicians unqualified? Or is there some fundamental problem?
Traffic flow analyzes the movement and interactions between individual drivers and vehicles between two destinations.
Unfortunately, analyzing traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with complete certainty.
Fortunately, drivers have fairly regular behavior; therefore, traffic flows are quite coherent and can be approximately expressed mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, the relationships have been defined in terms of three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and legal aspects of road services.
Insects were the first to begin flying. Thanks to their ability to fly, they could avoid enemies more easily and find food and mating partners more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings behind their body.
Thanks to this, they have more opportunities to hide in smaller places to avoid being caught by predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some believed he was right, but many thought the opposite; namely, that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the sun (and the rest of the stars as well).
It seems sensible, since it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world and the largest river. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
Approximately 20 percent of all the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in terms of the size of their construction and the excellence of the technique.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were then a thousand years old.
Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the one with the lowest population.
In Vatican City, Italian is used in its laws and official announcements.
Italian is also the usual language of most people working in public services, and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Gold, silver, copper, and other chemical elements have been known to people since ancient times because they can be found in their native form in nature and can be mined relatively easily with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These elements were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was similar to the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. He also theorized that, in order to complete what we see, they are transformed into other substances.
Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There can also be alloys that contain a small quantity of non-metallic elements, such as those containing carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that billions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, when the pencil was invented, it became a close friend to many people.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have emerged, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and use.
People now type messages on computer screens, without any need to pick up a pencil sharpener again.
Only one knows what will happen to the keyboard when something newer arrives.
The functioning of a fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like carrying a heavy cart uphill. When the nucleus splits again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei; that is, they tend to break down with little or no assistance.
The Moon's surface is made up of rock and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The shell has a width of about 70 km on the front side and about 100 km on the hidden side.
It is thinner beneath the lunar maria, and thicker in the highlands.
There might be more lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to come to the surface.
The goal of content theories is to understand what motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize as they reach adulthood.
These theories focus on two ideas: why people want things and what aspects of their environment will encourage them to do certain things or not to do them.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory are two well-known content theories.
Generally, two behaviors can arise when a director starts managing their former peers. On the one hand, continuing to be "one of the guys" (or girls).
It is difficult for such managers to make unpopular decisions, take measures to enforce discipline, evaluate performance, assign responsibilities, and find those responsible.
On the other hand, the person becomes unrecognizable, feeling the need to change everything the group has done and claim it as their own.
Ultimately, the leader is fundamentally responsible for the team's success and failure.
That attitude often causes friction between the team leaders and other members.
Virtual teams are made up of the same excellence standards as traditional teams, but there are a few slight differences.
Members of virtual teams function as a point of contact for their direct, physical team.
They often have more autonomy than members of traditional teams, perhaps because the teams meet according to changing time zones, which their local management does not understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also an exclusive component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team that each team member informs. The invisible team sets the standards for each team member.
Why would an organization want to undertake the lengthy process of forming an educational institution? Innovation is one of the goals of putting the concepts of organizational learning into practice.
When resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and clarity of thought can roam free.
Consequently, innovative processes to meet customer needs can emerge from a process of working together to overcome an obstacle within an organization.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, including knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Ángel (2006) describes the continuum perspective as a method for organizations to achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical perspective on studying cognition. Therefore, it limits the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior supports the research of scientists.
We have known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we have the opportunity to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
That gives us a lot of information and material to build stimulation models, which help us understand mental processes.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI is a very important branch of computer science, encompassing a machine's behavior, learning, and adaptation of intelligence.
In research on this, machines are prepared to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
To mention a few examples: control, planning and organization, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, with the aim of providing solutions to life's problems.
AA is used in many systems in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, but also in some software applications on home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of a classroom. Often, a teacher would like to take the students somewhere that they cannot go by bus.
Technology offers a solution for virtual excursions. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting next to their classmates.
Sharing a hike virtually is also a great way to reflect on the hike and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website each year about their field trip to the state capital. The website changes every year, but older versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often start a blog with poor grammar and spelling, having readers usually changes that.
Since the most demanding readers are often students, the blog writer starts making efforts to improve their writing style to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, writing blogs "encourages students to learn more about the world around them." The need to satisfy the interests of readers inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that promotes collaboration and encourages students to expand their knowledge beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can "empower students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can clarify their position in the context of others' writings, and summarize their perspective on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's wonderful and bilingual capital, and it boasts a good selection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north, the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and more.
All those things and more highlight Ontario, which in the opinion of foreigners is the most Canadian of Canadians.
Vast areas further north have few inhabitants, and some are almost uninhabited forests.
A population comparison that surprises many: the number of African Americans living in the United States is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, by a significant margin, and it's a unique continent when it comes to fauna.
Most small islands are either independent nations or affiliated with France, and are known as luxury vacation spots.
Arabs also brought Islam to the territory, and they occupied a large area in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route to travel from Europe to India.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel, and in the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: all female travelers are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (but one that doesn't look too expensive).
Women need to be aware that perhaps behaviors they perceive as harassment are cultural differences, and that it is common for someone to follow, grab their arm, etc.
Be tough when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether there are cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
Casablanca, a modern city, was founded by Berber fishermen in the 20th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but they abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and Spanish merchants, who established trading posts there, named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is the place in all of Morocco with the least interest for shopping.
Around the old Medina, you can easily find traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather products, hookahs, and all sorts of gadgets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city; it is located on the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma when lava covered the city's streets, especially the center.
Although Goma is reasonably secure, all visits outside Goma must be assessed to determine the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as the most affordable route for seeing mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The typical price (local) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Because it is rather difficult to reach, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor to talk about exotic and distant lands.
Nowadays, it is a poor city, but its fame attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS program, "Africa's Great Civilizations" special.
There is a noticeable difference between the city and other cities in the country, as it has an Arab flavour instead of an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms its southern border.
The park has an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 ecozones, each with a diverse fauna.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the icon of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African National Parks, there are daily fees for entry to the park and for conservation.
Perhaps someone would benefit from purchasing a Wild Card, which grants access to South African parks or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory, and it is the main attraction for many tourists.
The parade of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a luminous bar graph, visualized by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, get out of the island and go to the urban area of Kowloon waterfront, which is right across from it.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated in the northern coastal reclaimed area.
That is the place the British colonists took for themselves; so if you are looking for signs of the territory's colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
UNESCO declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The forest that encompasses the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not only composed of mangrove scrub and marsh; they also contain the last remnants of the immense jungles that once covered the plains of the Ganges.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about one third is covered by water/mud.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are about 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 chital deer there.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since intercity buses often fill up, it is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
In most districts there is a coastal Japanese bus service, which is comfortable and reliable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapok River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapok River and connects Oiapoque in Brazil with Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, and the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The bridge is 15 meters high. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is expected that the bridge will be operational in September 2017, once the Brazilian customs formalities are completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group in eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters and practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá. They lived by hunting, harvesting, and fishing.
16th-century Paraguay, previously called the "Giant Province of the Indies," was the result of the mixture between Spanish conquistadors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish started the colonial era, and it lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain a large part of its indigenous identity and culture.
Argentina is well known for having the best polo teams and players.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Championships and smaller matches can also be seen here throughout the year.
If you want news about tournaments and information on where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Asociación Argentina de Polo website.
The currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), and its value is equivalent to the British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the only bank on the island, in Stanley. It's past the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere, and credit cards and US dollars are also accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards may not be accepted on the surrounding islands, but British and US currency might be. Ask the owners in advance if you can use that payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands; therefore, exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and in the summer months, it is common to have temperatures above 30ºC.
Winter can be very cool; it doesn't usually freeze, but the wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There isn't a specific "rainy" or "dry" season: it rains a similar amount throughout the year.
Even though most of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wild animals and must not be fed or disturbed.
Following the park authority's instructions, stay at least 100 yards or meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards or meters away from other wild animals.
Despite their seemingly docile appearance, bison, moose, bears, and all similar large animals can attack.
Every year, several visitors are injured for not keeping the necessary distance. Since these animals are large, wild, and dangerous, give them space.
Also, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wild animals. Therefore, avoid carrying or preparing fragrant foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was discovered in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The infamous 1889 water dispute occurred in the port, where seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave.
All the ships sank, except for one British cruise ship. About 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the pro-independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the village led to the assassination of the paramount chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland is located between two harbours, there are many beaches; the most famous are in three areas.
The beaches on the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean; they stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and mostly shaded by pohutukawa trees.
In Waitemata Harbour, in central Auckland, the beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the luxurious neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers.
Those beaches are usually full of families, and there are many shops all along the coast. It is safe to swim there.
The main local beer is called "Number One". It's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines travel better.
The water from the local fountain is drinkable, but bottled water can be found everywhere if you don't trust it too much.
For Australians, a coffee called "flat white" is foreign. They call plain coffee "espresso", cappuccino has cream (without foam), and tea is served without milk.
They make hot chocolate according to Belgian standards. The juices are expensive but excellent.
Excursions to the Uharrietas are done throughout the year, and injuries related to these activities are not at all common.
However, follow the authorities' measures, pay attention to the signs, and pay close attention to safety measures.
Cubozoa are found in beaches and river estuaries between October and April north of 1770. They can also be found outside this area during that season.
There are sharks, but it is not common for them to attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and tend to flee.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean; their main habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Having made a reservation in advance, the traveler will be more relaxed knowing that they have a place to sleep upon arrival.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, but you can use their services to find other types of accommodation, such as campsites.
Travel agents often offer deals that combine breakfast, transportation to or from the airport, or flight and hotel.
They can also hold a reservation for you, if you need time to consider the offer or to prepare documentation (such as a visa) to travel there.
Changes or requests must be made through the travel agent, not by contacting the hotel directly.
In the case of some festivals, most music festival attendees decide to camp there, and most consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the activities, you'll have to go early to find a camping spot near the music area.
Remember that even if the music ends on the main stages, music may continue to play in other parts of the festival until late.
Some festivals have areas that families with children can use for camping.
If you are crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, check the location of your cabin, as crossing the ice creates a tremendous noise for those most exposed to it.
St. Petersburg cruises also offer the opportunity to spend time in the city. Cruise ship passengers do not have visa requirements (check specifics).
Casinos make a great effort to ensure that guests waste as much time and money as possible. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are not easy to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and staying there.
In some places they offer alcoholic drinks on the house. However, drunkenness and good sense don't go together, and the best bettors know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or through mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or very low temperatures.
On frozen or snowy roads, there is very little friction and you can't drive like you can on asphalt.
When there's frost, it can snow enough to get stuck.
There may be reduced visibility due to snow, or condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, frosts and snowfalls are common in many countries, and traffic is usually not interrupted throughout the year.
African safaris are the main attraction for tourists and an unforgettable moment for many visitors.
The term safari, in common parlance, specifically refers to a trip to see the fauna that lives in the African savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, approach cars and a good view can be obtained using standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and panthers are shy sometimes and you will see them better with binoculars.
On foot safaris (also called "bush walks", "walking safaris" or "walks") involve walking, for a few hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games. It hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before being informed about the delay, you may be in a difficult situation.
The guidelines for cancellation can be changed, but until March, cancellations caused by the coronavirus will not be extended until July 2020, the date the Olympics will be held.
Tickets for the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes will make them dry faster. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available to borrow, even if there isn't one in the room.
If there's no iron available, or if you don't like using ironed socks, you can use a hairdryer as an alternative, if one exists.
Don't overheat the fabric (it could shrink the clothes, or in the worst cases, burn them).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective than others when it comes to specific risks.
In some places, it is enough to boil the water for a minute; in other places, several minutes are needed.
Some filters are more effective than others, and if you are concerned, we recommend buying a sealed water bottle from a large company.
Travelers may encounter plagues of animals they do not know in their homeland.
These pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worse cases trigger an allergic reaction, and even spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with violence are not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping at customs is a good opportunity to buy tax and duty-free products in certain locations.
Travelers from countries with high taxes can save a fortune, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The drive between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most difficult part of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway and often passes through remote, isolated places.
If you aren't used to driving on rural roads, be patient: steep sections, narrow roads, and tight curves are common.
The speed limits on the signs are noticeably lower than in previous sections. They are usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and it is very important to follow them.
Strangely, there is more coverage there than in other points along the road, for example, in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are very sweet and those from Bavaria are rich and varied, similar to those of their Austrian neighbors in the south of the region.
Fruit tarts are common and they put apples in the tarts throughout the year; in summer, however, they use cherries and plums.
Many German sweets contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes especially go well with a cup of coffee.
If you want small but rich pastries, try the ones called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is based on herbs and spices and is combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In Northern India and inland Pakistan, yogurt is widely used to make curry. In Southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is used.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands, and Indonesian cuisine encompasses the culinary traditions of many different regions.
However, without further qualification, the term usually refers to food from central and eastern Java.
Javanese gastronomy is available throughout the archipelago today and includes various modestly seasoned meals. In fact, the favorite flavors of the Javanese population are peanut, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are the rider's support and hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with great stability, but there may be safety-related risks, as the rider can get trapped.
If a rider falls from a horse but one of their feet gets caught in the stirrup, the horse can drag them if it runs off. To reduce the risk, some safety measures should be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear heeled boots with smooth, wide soles.
Secondly, some saddles, especially English-style ones, have safety bars which allow the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle if the rider falls and is pushed backwards.
The Cochamó Valley: Chile's main destination for climbing and known as the Yosemite of South America; it also has large granite walls and abundant rock.
The views from the summits are amazing. Many of the world's climbers are opening new routes on these walls of endless possibilities.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered slopes with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a very popular activity, which also includes travel. These enthusiasts are often called "ski travelers," as they organize their vacations around skiing in a specific place.
The idea of skiing is very old. Images of skiers can be found in caves, dating back to 5,000 BC!
Downhill skiing originated at least in the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians founded the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Cross-country skiing: this activity is also called ski touring.
It is related, but not in the style of alpine ski mountaineering, because it is done on slopes and requires skis and boots that are more robust.
Imagine routes to sketch like those for hiking.
Under these conditions, you will cover a greater distance than you would on foot, but few will achieve the speed of those who ski mountaineering without a backpack and on prepared trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to several countries would require applying for visas and going through security checks multiple times.
On the contrary, the Schengen area functions like a single country in that regard.
While you are within that area, you can cross borders without having to go through passport control checkpoints.
Also, if you have a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for a visa to enter each of the countries that are members of the Schengen area, thus saving you time and money and avoiding the need to fill out documents.
There is no global definition to specify which handmade products are considered antiques. Tax agencies define as antiques those goods that are more than 100 years old.
The definitions have geographic variables; the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be considered obsolete, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer husbandry is a very important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding it is also important in other occupations.
Traditionally, however, not all Sámi engaged in large-scale reindeer herding; rather, they lived off fishing, hunting, or similar activities, and mostly used reindeer as transport animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi people work in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi territory.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "gypsy" is sometimes taken as an insult because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misperceptions about Roma people.
If the country you are going to visit is declared unsafe to travel to, this may affect health insurance for travelers or trip cancellation insurance.
We also recommend following the governments' recommendations, but their recommendations are aimed at the local population.
As an example, it's possible that Americans, Europeans, or Arabs in the Middle East experience different situations.
Travel advisories are merely a summary of the political situation in each country.
The perspectives offered tend to be superficial, general, and overly simplistic compared to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term used to define dangerous meteorological phenomena that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or death.
Severe weather can happen anywhere, and there are many types, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Violent winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and uncontrolled fires are some examples and consequences of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.

Travelers are advised to be aware of the risks of severe weather that may affect their region, as it affects travel plans.
It is advisable for anyone who wants to visit countries considered war zones to receive professional training.
If you search the Internet for a course about hostile environments, you will probably see the address of a local company.
The courses usually cover the topics mentioned here in greater detail, and they also typically offer practical experience.
The courses last between 2-5 days and include role-playing, numerous first aid activities, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about surviving in nature are common, but publications dealing with war zones are very few.
Travelers seeking gender reassignment surgery should ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The desire to create identity documents (X) that do not indicate gender or updated documents that match the desired name varies from one government to another.
The tendency to accept these documents also varies in foreign governments.
Since September 11, 2001, security screening searches are much stricter.
Before receiving surgery, transgender people cannot expect to pass through scanners without their privacy and dignity being harmed.
Rip currents are the return flow of waves. On beaches, they are often created by waves breaking on a reef or similar feature.
Due to the underwater topography, the return current concentrates in deeper sections, where a fast, deep-water current is generated.
Most deaths are due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the current; indeed, it is impossible to swim out of it.
As soon as you're out of the current, swimming to shore won't be any harder than usual.
Try to hold on to something somewhere so the current doesn't catch you again, or, depending on your ability or if someone has seen you, wait for help to arrive.
Reverse culture shock hits harder than culture shock (it has less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily immersed themselves in another culture sometimes find it very difficult to readjust to their original culture.
Having lived abroad, upon returning home, you have adapted to another culture and lost some customs of your home culture.
When you first went abroad, I'm sure people were patient and understanding, knowing that someone coming from another country needs to adapt.
People may not foresee that travelers returning home also need patience and understanding.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in that area.
The pyramids can be seen at night, and you can quietly watch them before the show starts.
Normally, one always hears the noise of tourists and vendors. The atmosphere created by the sounds and lights is like a fairytale.
The Sphinx is the backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on pyramids and they illuminate the pyramids.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases; in fact, there were sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km from the peninsula. King George Island is the largest, and Villa Las Estrellas is located there.
There are also others, such as Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the emissions from a caldera of an active volcano have formed a wonderful natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region located in the south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
There, the peninsula's mountains merge with the high plateau, and reappear to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern portions or the Sentinel Range contain the highest mountains in Antarctica, namely the Vinson Massif, with its highest peak being Mount Vinson at 4,892 m.
In remote locations without coverage, a satellite phone will be your only option.
Satellite phones are not a common alternative to cell phones, as you have to be outdoors to make calls, in clear line of sight of the satellite.
This service is typically used by ships and recreational vessels, as well as expeditions that require remote data and voice communication.
Your local telephone service provider can give you more information on connecting to that service.
Among those planning to take a sabbatical year, traveling and learning is becoming increasingly common.
This option is particularly popular among those who have finished high school, as it allows them to take a gap year before starting university without interrupting their studies.
In many cases, if you participate in a foreign course during your sabbatical year, your chances of entering higher education in your home country increase.
Please remember that you will need to pay a registration fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for sailing. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need to eat in archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and largest lakes are big enough to accommodate any yacht, small boats or kayaks offer different experiences.
Navigation is the most common leisure activity in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
The same is true in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but the figure is quite significant (for example, in the Netherlands the proportion is one in forty people).
Most major Baltic Sea cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
Thanks to that, you have a couple of days available to visit the historic city, and return to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only use shore excursions from the cruise ship to go ashore, you won't need another visa (since 2009).
In some cruise brochures, Berlin (Germany) is mentioned. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea and the trip to visit the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can seem frightening to people of any age and background, especially if they have never flown or have experienced a traumatic event.
That is not a reason to be ashamed: the personal fears or disgusts that many people have are no different.
Understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help some people cope with a fear based on something unknown or out of control.
Air mail companies are well paid for sending things quickly. Often, time is very important in the case of business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies had problems with these accounts.
If they send the products by air freight, it takes several days on some routes to unload the products and clear customs.
Sending the products as checked baggage was the only way to speed up the process. However, airlines do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, and this may be an opportunity you can take advantage of.
Without a doubt, the most obvious way to travel in business or first class is to pay a pile of money (or, even better, have your company pay the amount) to have that privilege.
However, this option doesn't come cheap: normally, a business class flight is four times more expensive than an economy fare, and in the case of first class, it's eleven times more expensive!
Generally, it doesn't make sense to look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights going from one destination to another.
Airline companies know very well that there is a small group of travelers willing to pay high prices to go anywhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge according to that privilege.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered inter-ethnic conflict.
As a result of that conflict, the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria was created in 1994 in eastern Moldova. It has its own government and currency, but they are not recognized by UN member states.
Economic ties between the two regions of Moldova have been restored, although political negotiations have failed.
Eastern Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very convenient transportation hub.
Once, this city was ancient Smyrna, but now it is a modern, developed, and populous commercial area, located around a giant bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and shopping centers have traditional red tiles on the roofs, XVIII century market and mosque and old churches, although the city has more of a flavor of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.

Do not deface the area by making traces or drawings on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half prefer to speak in Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are written in Catalan, as Catalan is the first official language established by law.
But Spanish is also used a lot in public transport and other services.
Regular metro announcements are made only in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are announced by an automated system in several languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.

The Parisians' rigid exterior will quickly disappear if you show basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is full of forests, especially beech and fir, and a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation predominates.
It has a diverse and remarkable plant community, thanks to its microclimate creation, different soils, and numerous altitude levels.
A wide variety of animal and bird species also live in that area.
Unusual fauna can be found there, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, and wood grouse, as well as more common species.
Women must wear skirts below the knee and have their shoulders covered to visit the monasteries.
Most monasteries provide scarves for women who haven't come prepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it has bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that reach below the knee.
That can also be taken from the entrance supplies, but since that clothing is not washed after being used by one person, you might not feel comfortable wearing those skirts. One size fits men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used in all dishes.

Pre-modern observatories are now obsolete and are used as museums or educational venues.
Since light pollution wasn't a problem in ancient times, they used to locate them in cities or on campuses, because reaching them was easier compared to the ones built nowadays.
Most modern telescopes for research are giant installations located in remote areas with suitable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms, known as hanami, began in Japanese culture in the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the most beloved.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look their best when they are in their natural environment; therefore, resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
Furthermore, if you are visiting a formally organized garden and you pick "specimens," you will undoubtedly be thrown out.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, it is very easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything once you get there.

They also define the main routes for walking and cycling.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated to commemorate the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with holidays have been adopted by non-believers as well in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
One of the traditions consists of spending Easter night awake, in the open air, to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may also have been a spring and fertility rite in pre-Christian times.
More traditional churches hold a Paschal Vigil on the Saturday night of Easter weekend, and at midnight parishioners typically begin a celebration to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
Initially, all the animals that arrived on the islands arrived by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not make that journey, and the giant tortoise was the first grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which is when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It's a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark almost all day.
