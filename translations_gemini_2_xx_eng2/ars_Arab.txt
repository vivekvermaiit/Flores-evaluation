What confirms this is not only that some dinosaurs, at the very least, had feathers—a widely accepted theory already—but it also offers details that fossils generally can't, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were a chestnut brown color on top and pale or carotenoid-colored on its underside.
The discovery also provides a deep understanding of feather evolution in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not contain a fully developed bony structure called a "rachis," but they possess other feather characteristics—such as barbs and barbules—researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The wing structure suggests they weren't used for flight but for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggest that even though this tail belongs to a juvenile dinosaur, the sample shows mature plumage, not a chick's rear end.
The researchers pointed out that although this is a small dinosaur tail, the sample shows the feathers of a mature bird, not the feathers of a chick.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and wounding more than twenty others.

As for the work completed, it's mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations that were recorded about the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for is due to tidal forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the Earth causing tides, the Milky Way galaxy attracts the Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy.
Scientists were able to deduce that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
That theory explains that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around it in what resembles a halo, and is composed of tiny particles in large numbers.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech affair: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed ballot indicating their preferred candidate in an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law regulates the procedures with unwelcome strictness.
Since 1409 AH, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can ensure that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of the voting process, and that only envelopes from registered, duly authorized, and mandated voters are added.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under intense supervision, following specific procedures.

Edgar Vigueilla was injured in his arm and jaw while Christopher Schneider needed reconstructive surgery on his face.
Schneider suffers from constant pain, blindness in one eye, and the loss of part of his skull with a face reconstructed from titanium, all of which occurred while the "Ouka" weapon failed while aimed at the head of a fifth man.
Schneider testified via video link from a US Air Force base in his home country.
After Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the championship.
Her first race was the slalom, where she got a "Did Not Finish" (DNF) result in her first run. 36 out of 116 competitors received the same result in that race.
And her other race – the giant slalom – saw her finish tenth in the women's sitting group with a total running time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place Austrian, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place Hungarian, Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female skiers from the disabled team failed to complete their runs, and 45 out of a total of 117 female skiers in the giant slalom race failed to achieve a ranking in the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kangar, Butha Kanga, Rampro Kangar, Ghaza Kangar, and Vishnu Kangar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused were presented before the court with their faces covered.
Despite there being three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred has been temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from a red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since that time, Adekoya became accused of murdering her son in the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh.
She is being held in custody pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be questionable because her picture has been widely publicized.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice operates differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of images potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee points out that "it seems to me that journalists are definitely heading in a dangerous direction if they publish pictures or the like of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for claims, indicated to journalists that there would be no further comment until at least after the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, where Palestine wants its borders to be based on pre-1387 AH war borders in the Middle East.
Other topics reportedly covered included the future status of Jerusalem, which is a significant issue for both peoples, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years upon signing an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to this presence for only five years.
The guards should have closely supervised those released in the supplemental pest control experiment, as the experiment was under observation and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In partnership between the "National Parks and Wildlife Service" and the "Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia," qualified volunteers were selected under the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) Heritage and Conservation, the four hunters selected for the initial hunt received comprehensive safety briefings and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is the fifth interim electoral council for Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the interim electoral council as part of a series of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was like Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in Shawwal.
Protests, sometimes violent, erupted due to the failure to hold elections that were scheduled to take place since 1432 AH.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod overheating malfunctions have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four individuals.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 incidents of overexertion, which the company described as "non-serious."
The ministry responded to the call to postpone Apple's report by saying it was "truly unfortunate."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (Friday 12:19 AM Mecca time).
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands' Office of Emergency Management stated that no damage has been reported in the country.
As stated by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there are no indications of a potential tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued, and the death of at least six has been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly individuals, in addition to Filipino photographers, were released early.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to go to the restroom. And Mendoza was shot.
He followed in his father's footsteps and took up medicine as a profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and then began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in the year 1379 AH.
Liggins began investigating premature birth in his spare time, while working at the hospital.
His research showed that administering a certain hormone will accelerate lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered the flight recorders, or the "black box," on Wednesday.
Luna's fellow wrestlers also praised her.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the original queen of extreme. My first manager, Luna, passed away on the night of the supermoon. A strong, one-of-a-kind woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was eccentric like me... and maybe even more so... I loved her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people surveyed in the pre-federal election poll of 1431 AH, the percentage of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 1429 AH.
During the 1431 AH federal election campaign, then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed agree with this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
Regarding the opposing views in the survey, 29% of respondents felt Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believed Australia should never be a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist's physical fitness has been called into question due to his complaining, as he was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle in three legs at the Commonwealth Games.
He couldn't take the necessary medications to overcome the pain because their use is prohibited in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on Muharram 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using different devices and software starting in the month of Safar, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source for delivering water to Earth, along with organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed long ago from the collision of comets with Earth.
Cuomo, 53, began his term earlier this year and signed a bill into law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "political babble and nonsense."
It is likely that he will run for president in 1437 AH.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration claims will allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, as well as save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike the old technology that uses ground-based radar, to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft locations with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more specific information.
There is no additional transportation available, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, in addition to the unavailability of parking and park-and-ride facilities on the ground.
Concerns about a lack of transportation raised the possibility of the match being held behind closed doors, without the presence of fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal "Science" reported on the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the evolution of new species took only two generations—although it was believed that this process took much longer—due to interbreeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, a medium ground finch, a migrating cactus finch, and a sharp-beaked ground finch.
Gold can be formed into various shapes. It can be rolled into small forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be wound and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and affixed to another metal. And it can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
It is called the pH of the chemical substance, and you can make an indicator for this pH using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline a chemical substance is.
The pH level is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the dry ingredients together, then squeeze them with clean, wet hands until they form a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, giving you a strange feeling and forming a sort of coating.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with a flushing mechanism in almost every house connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the homes of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women frequented them together in mixed company.
When you connect with someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then reflects it almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent to space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and the vision.
It takes a giant rocket, over 100 feet tall, to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the shape of the world in an amazing way; however, providing an easier and faster means of transportation remains its most important contribution to us.
He brought us the train, the car, and many other transportation devices.
Below them in the hierarchy are more mid-sized cats that prey on medium-sized animals ranging from rabbits to gazelles and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats) that eat more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a specific role for each cat that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
A lion pride consists of one to three adult males, in addition to up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closer to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions acts like a pack of wolves or dogs, and surprisingly, the animals are similar to the lion (but not other big cats) in behavior and are very deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar isn't like a lion's full-throated roar, but it's closer to shouting angry words.
Dwarf mongooses like to eat small animals, so they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals that the dwarf mongoose hunts are smaller than it in size.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by their sense of smell; they smell where they have been on the ground.
It can see well in the dark using night vision, and move very stealthily too. Pygmy leopard cats hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population to which they belong (for example, if they move across a mountain range or a river, or move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were previously in.
Given that this new environment contains different resources and competitors, the new group will need different properties or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than it previously needed to be.
Absolutely no change has occurred to the original inhabitants at all; they still require the same methods of adaptation, just as we are accustomed to them.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, their similarity to other populations gradually decreases.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will look so different that we can no longer call them the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is considered an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is also from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the dominant predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Her long jaws were studded with over 70 blade-like teeth, in addition to another set in the roof of her mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that stood in her way.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and he was probably a carnivore.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex was no match for it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of bizarre or unusual festive items, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their food sitting on benches, wealthy men liked to hold feasts together where they reclined on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, and it was considered the god's house.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to fulfill the gods' needs during celebrations and holidays.
Each temple has an open courtyard that leads to a secluded sanctuary that only priests can enter.
Sometimes unique towers in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a safe haven for the god.
In the warm Middle Eastern climate, the home was not of great importance.
Most of the Hebraic family's life was spent outdoors.
The women used to cook in the courtyard; the shops were just open shelves facing the street. Stone was used in the construction of houses.
There weren't large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was expensive.
Humans have inhabited Greenland sporadically. Norse sagas recount that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were living there previously.
There were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history in the countries of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, even though each country was "Scandinavian."
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence bears the inscription, "The original Declaration of Independence dated 18 Jumada I, 1190 AH." The text appears at the bottom of the document, inverted.
Although the writer of this part of the text is not specifically known, we do know that the large manuscript (measuring 29¾ inches × 24½ inches) was stored folded at the beginning of its existence.
Therefore, it's likely that the symbol was simply added as a label.
The landings on D-Day and the subsequent battles led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was not yet liberated.
France was ruled by "Vichy." These are the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1359 AH and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 Sha'ban 1359 AH, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces liberated southern France and were on their way towards Germany.
Civilization is an individual culture shared among a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The origin of the word civilization is from the Latin "civilis," which means "civil" or "relating to citizens," which in turn relates to the Latin "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," and this also defines it as a communal societal mass.
Self-governing cities are the precursors to nations. Civilizational culture inherently means the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and the equitable dissemination of knowledge.
Minor cultures often fade away without leaving any tangible historical evidence and are not recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies initially formed a weak central government – with Congress being its only component – under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any power to levy taxes, and due to the absence of a national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the state governments, which were largely uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
In addition, it does not have the authority to override tax laws and tariffs imposed between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all states before they could be amended, and the states mocked the central government to the point that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and they were the FIFA World Cup champions in 1427 AH.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan comprises nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island country in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to - from a geographical perspective - as an "archipelago."
Taiwan began its path to resurgence in the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or the Beautiful Island.
In the year 1033 AH, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began changing native grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1094 AH, the armies of the Qing dynasty (1053 AH - 1330 AH) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire in the year 1302 AH.
In the year 1312 AH, and after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War between 1311 AH and 1312 AH, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until the year 1364 AH.
The city of Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1396 AH, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work has continued to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
Its production is still ongoing to this day, but more importantly, the image sensor aspect ratio of digital cameras has inherited it.
The 35mm format is a bit confusing, actually, as it's 36mm wide and 24mm tall.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this image (when divided by 12 to get the ratio to the simplest integer) will be 3:2.
This aspect ratio is equal to or close to that of many common formats (e.g., Advanced Photo System formats).
The often misused and mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining some order in a clear image.
It is mentioned that the most impactful spot for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was subjected to scrutiny during this period of European history.
Christianity bound the European countries together for over a thousand years despite the differences in language and customs.
The immense power I possessed affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
Among the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds exist specifically for this reason.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the Church resided in Rome, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question the extent to which its adherence to the tenets of faith remained.
Britain quickly moved to blockade Germany by sea after the outbreak of skirmishes.
The strategy proved its effectiveness by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating generally accepted international law codified and coordinated in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sections of the oceans, which threatens even neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes among most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the countries wanted to avoid this situation again in the future.
In the year 1301 AH, Tesla moved to the United States of America to work with the Edison company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each dynasty in power was of a different kind.
In addition, between each ruling dynasty, there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, a fierce war erupted between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the fighting to sit on the highest seats in the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to a republican system, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just the ruler.
Also, after the revolution, professions were open to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same applies to the army because instead of army ranks being based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to ignite their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira" above Mount "Al-Nour" for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has remained throughout the ages, offers a very vivid depiction of the Prophet Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you enter the cave, you become completely isolated.
And nothing can be seen but the clear, beautiful sky above the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century of the current era, the Great Pyramid is considered one of the massive pyramids built in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upbow" symbol looks like the letter V, and the "downbow" symbol looks like a stapler or a square without its bottom side.
The upper mark indicates that you must start from the tip and push the bow, while the lower mark means that you must start from the end of the bow (where your hand holds the bow) and pull it.
Typically, the upper bow produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to pencil in your own markings, but remember that the printed curved markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
Terrified, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a mob of market women on Muharram 17, 1204 AH, to return from Versailles to Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a large crowd of people shouting and chanting against the King and Queen.
A group of fans managed to force the King and Queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At some point, a member of the gang brandished the head of one of the slain Royal Guards at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The Filipino people bore the costs of the United States of America's imperialist war in its invasion of the Philippines.
These people were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a significant portion of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Naturally, the super-profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people will constitute the primary gains for American imperialism.
We need to understand the underlying context for the creation of the organization in order to comprehend the Knights Templar.
The era in which those events transpired was known as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (390 AH - 700 AH).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which altogether ended around the year 893 AH.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology push or technological imperative to the rigid feeling that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
There are two general ideas common in most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that this technology, in turn, has inherent "effects" on societies, rather than being tied to society.
For example, one might say that the automobile engine necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, building a road network spanning the entire country isn't economically viable for a handful of cars, so new methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Collective car ownership also leads to a higher rate of road accidents, which in turn leads to the innovation of new technologies in healthcare to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture connected to that geography arose. These people, being in harmony with the place of the community, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is famous for being the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began in 400 AD and continued until 493 AD.
Her situation deteriorated during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusades had returned carrying gifts like silk and spices, which were of higher value than what the Byzantine markets were offering.
During this time, Paris was given the title of "fashion capital" instead of Constantinople.
Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th or 11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, Byzantine culture in the East had a strong influence on clothing.
Despite that, due to the slow channels of communication, trends may be delayed in the West by as much as 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at that time, resulting from the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture carried out to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming – which is often organic – is a simple system using saved seeds that are suited to the region's ecosystem, in addition to crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, with the aim of increasing yield.
Historically, most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are likely to be distinctive due to age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, ethnic, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures signal their membership through distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes clothing, behavior, and dialect.
Among the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization is relying on the unfortunate cases of children who have suffered from neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, and who were not socially connected to adults during their upbringing.
These children are called "feral" or the. Some lost children have been locked up by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the child was abandoned because the parents rejected the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Developmentally delayed children may have experienced abuse during childhood or severe trauma before being abandoned or running away.
And others are alleged to have been raised by animals; while some are said to have lived in the wilderness alone.
When raised by non-human animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limitations) that closely resemble those of their specific animal caregiver, such as fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes beyond that.
Interactive learning isn't just a method of learning, but rather an assistive tool that provides support for individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual or in person, and in another sense, a teacher is a form of interactive learning, as is Clippy in Microsoft Office.
The program supports interactive learning internally and aims to pose questions, provide motivation, and explain procedures that a student might find difficult to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment not based on nurturing, care, and education, but they do.
We recognize that the alternative care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care must provide all the necessities they lacked in the homes they previously left.
The internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage approaches and methods of gratification.
For example, some suggest "learning" and "socialization" as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivational aspects when they studied audience response to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last for fractions of a second.
It is specifically claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks pointed out in his paper that the President's speech suggests that individuals who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to accurately assess honesty.
Indeed, it posits the idea that these abilities in analyzing human behavior are shared with some animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research clarified the existence of two groups of genetic variations: a recessive group and a dominant one.
Mutation introduces new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the pool of phenotypic variation.
The processes of separation and recombination work to make the variation random back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, primates with digestive systems similar to humans find it difficult to meet their amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Failure to do so will lead to dire consequences: growth retardation, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The readily accessible plant resources available in abundance were proteins obtainable from leaves and legumes, but these proteins are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
On the contrary, animal-based foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide high amounts of protein and contain all the essential amino acids.
Taking everything into consideration, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" somehow in the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking yourself up during your natural sleep period and then going back to sleep after a short period (of 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively gentle alarm that brings you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm during your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options, based on biological systems, include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The less stress, the more positivity you gain, which gives you the strength of life. Every person has the inherent ability to find perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that hinders us on the path to this goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it expanded through the Mahayana path of love and other techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path of love that embraces everyone.
Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chants, and visualizations, specifically with Kundalini Yoga.
The Tibetan Meditation Center is Deity Yoga. Through visualizing different deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened awareness is created.
Germany represented a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States of America, but with the end of the war, the clash of systems, procedures, and cultures led to the outbreak of conflict between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
This war was supposed to last for the next forty years, with the fighting taking place on the ground, by proxy armies, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, and in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By Ramadan 17, 1358 AH, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Bridge.
Nevertheless, these plans became obsolete overnight when over 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is considered the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Tradition dictates that the role of naval forces is to ensure your country's ability to transport its people and goods, while at the same time, intercepting your enemy's ability to transport their people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy modern examples is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II, where the Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was trying to counter this invasion, and it relied on submarines to do so.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to invade Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated nearly 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were generally raised in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were mostly children or adolescents, similar to the widely known shepherd. These grazing methods are still in use today.
Cartways were established in England at a time dating back to the 16th century.
Although the old railway cars consisted of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and haul larger loads compared to the roads, which were considered quite rough at that time.
Railway tracks were invented relatively early to stabilize the routes, but it later became clear over time that placing a steel strip on top of the track made it more effective.
This has become a common practice, but the iron led to further wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
In the end, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In the year 1181 AH, the first complete iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first means of transportation. Humans began walking upright about two million years ago, coinciding with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning "upright man").
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright consistently.
Bipedal species have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a way that is more in harmony with the environment, and we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is exactly like treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problems, and we must eliminate them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and the problems have become bigger due to population growth and the extravagant lifestyle of humans.
Following its adoption by the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a short distance from the buildings to the printing press of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap's Monetary Flyers."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on the eighth of Rajab.
One of them was sent to George Washington on the sixth of Rajab, and he read it to his forces in New York on the ninth of Rajab. A copy of it reached London on the tenth of Sha'ban.
The twenty-five Dunlap broadsides represent the oldest surviving copies of the American Declaration of Independence document, but the original handwritten version did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
They often think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still make them look like dinosaurs.
It has feet with protective outer layers and claws, lays eggs, and walks on its hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus.
All computers used today rely, by default, on processing encrypted information in the form of binary numbers.
A binary digit can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and these digits are referred to as binary digits – or bits, if we use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning symptoms may not appear immediately. An immediate diagnosis cannot be made based on symptoms like vomiting, which are general enough.
The best indicator of internal poisoning might be the presence of an open container of medications or toxic household chemicals.
Refer to the label for first aid instructions specific to the particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term is derived from the age-old knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both "assassin bugs" and "bed bugs" are characterized by a long incubation period, and they adapt to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it one of the most prevalent neurological diseases among young adults and those of middle age.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as males.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to create an adoption plan for their children.
As part of the adoption process, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can care for the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
Despite that, it's not unique in this regard; experimentation and experience are considered tests that can be used to refute one or more potential hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often critically depend on the existence of self-sustained oscillations and their generation by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including those of bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that will continue for periods of successive cycles even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to inject their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two labeling experiments, either labeling the DNA using radioactive phosphorus or labeling its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a diverse range of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wild plant and animal life.
Examples of activities that can be done at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting gardens, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of that is visiting, photographing, and learning information about this type of ape (orangutans) in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns in their cars to go to their workplaces, and they are met on the road by other workers heading to the place they just left.
In this dynamic mode of transportation, everyone somehow supports and is connected to a transportation system based on private cars.
Current science indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human development over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation systems. Everyone complains about the transportation systems.
You rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow analysis is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave with a reasonable degree of consistency; as such, traffic flow enjoys a reasonable degree of consistency and can be expressed mathematically in an approximate manner.
To better illustrate traffic flow, relationships were established between three key properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape from enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are characterized by their ability to fold their wings back along the length of their body.
And this gives them a greater variety of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings today are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some saw him as right, but many people believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
That seems logical, since you don't feel the earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, reaching a width of up to 6 miles at times.
20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite the continued construction of stone pyramids until the end of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, nothing has surpassed the pyramids of Giza in terms of size and artistic excellence in construction.
The ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and has the lowest population.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also a language of daily life used by most state employees, while Latin is typically used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all these elements can be found in nature in their native form and can be extracted relatively easily using rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle posited that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also assumed that they transform into new materials to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered minerals. And of course, there are also minerals like silver and gold.
You can also obtain alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is created from matter. All matter is created from small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could occupy the space of the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing tools, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and fewer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without needing to use a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle of gathering energy to create a nucleus filled with protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. The nucleus splits again, and a portion of that energy is released.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with or without slight agitation.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There might be more lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to come to the surface.
Content theories revolve around finding what excites or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that emerge spontaneously upon reaching adulthood.
These theories explore what motivates some people to desire the things they do and what aspects of their surrounding environment cause them to do, or not do, certain things.
Two common content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former peers: one is trying to remain "one of the guys (or girls)."
This type of manager struggles with making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the opposite end, the individual transforms into an unrecognizable person who feels they have to change everything the team was doing and own it.
Ultimately, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team members.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical teams.
They often have greater autonomy than members of traditional teams, as their teams may meet according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a real "shadow team" from (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is described as a unique component of a virtual team.
Each member submits their reports to the management team, "the invisible team," which sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to establish an educational organization in a time-consuming process? Innovation is considered one of the goals of applying corporate learning concepts.
Creativity and ingenuity can be achieved when all available resources are utilized effectively across the functional departments within the organization.
As a result, the synergy within the organization to overcome obstacles can lead to the emergence of new, innovative measures that meet the client's needs.
Before the organization is capable of innovating, the leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuity approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neuroscience data provides tangible evidence for the theoretical approach in investigating knowledge, thereby narrowing the scope of research and making it much more precise.
Understanding the connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain cognitive functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore the structures and processes of the brain in ways we never have before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Despite artificial intelligence having strong connotations with science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
Research in artificial intelligence involves creating machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling, planning, scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and in addition, recognizing handwriting, voice, and faces.
Such things have become separate fields focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence is now used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military. It has also been used to build several software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are considered a big part of any classroom. Often, a teacher might like to take her students to places where going by bus is out of the question.
Technology enables the solution through virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or enjoy fine art while sitting with their classmates.
Also, participating in a virtual field trip is a great way to revisit a particular trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned each year, but the older versions are kept online as a record.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with imperfect grammar and spelling, having an audience generally changes that.
Given that students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins striving to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Additionally, blogs "force students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to feed public interest inspires students to be skilled and helpful (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by responding effectively to online materials, students can define their positions within the context of others' writings, in addition to defining their own opinions on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada, featuring a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is located in the far south, and in the north lies the beautiful, untapped wilderness of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered the essence of Canadian identity by outsiders.
The large areas in the north are relatively sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited.
For comparison, and astonishing to many: the number of African Americans residing in the United States is greater than the entire population of Canada.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest island, and it is a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent states, or are affiliated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs carried Islam to the lands, and it spread extensively in the Comoros Islands and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The African coast borders the area from the north, and the Atlantic Ocean borders it from the south and west.
Women: Regardless of their actual marital status, female travelers should declare that they are married.
It's classy to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences may lead to what they may consider harassment and that it is customary to watch them, and grab them by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (don't let cultural differences make it acceptable!).
The Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids used the modern city of Casablanca as a strategic port called "Anfa" after it was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name "Casa Branca", only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1168 AH.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city and named it Dar al-Baida, and the Spanish merchants, who established trading posts there, called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is considered one of the least exciting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods throughout the old city, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, shisha pipes, and all sorts of cheap merchandise, but it's all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In the year 1423 AH, Goma was destroyed due to lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Any visits outside of Goma require investigation to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province, while Goma itself is reasonably safe.
The city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and some of the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda (which is a motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma, and the usual price (locally) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Besides its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for distant, exotic lands.
Timbuktu is currently a poor city, despite its reputation which makes it a tourist attraction, in addition to having an airport.
In the year 1411 AH, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops for Henry Louis Gates in the PBS series about the Wonders of the African World.
The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country's cities, as it has a more Arab character than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, extending along the Mozambique border to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and is bordered to the south by the Crocodile River.
The park's area is 19,500 square kilometers, and it is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is considered one of the most attractive regions in South Africa, and a major national park (South African National Parks).
There are daily fees to maintain the park and for entry, similar to all national parks in South Africa.
It might be helpful to buy a Wild Card, as it allows you access to a selection of South African parks or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong territory its name and is the place that many tourists consider their destination.
The row of buildings that paints the Hong Kong skyline resembles a shimmering graph displayed above the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shoreline.
This is the place that British colonizers took as their own special place, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is considered the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland across remote areas of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps; they hold some of the last remaining evidence of the dense jungles that once covered the Ganges River plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 square kilometers, almost a third of which is covered by water/swamps.
Since 1385 AH (corresponding to approximately 1965 CE), the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart the intercity terminal (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because buses between neighborhoods are often full, it's best to buy tickets in advance a few days prior.
Most areas are served by small Japanese "coaster" buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to get around to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The towers are 83 meters high and 378 meters long, with two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in Sha'ban 1432 AH, but it was not opened to traffic until Rabi' al-Awwal 1438 AH.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in Ramadan 1438 AH, coinciding with the expected completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay; the Guarani lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting animals, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay originated, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," as a result of an encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonial era that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 943 AH, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competitions of the year are held in Dhu al-Hijjah, at the polo fields in Las Canitas.
In addition, smaller championships and matches can be watched here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy polo match tickets, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
The money at the only bank can be exchanged for the islands that are located in Stanley, on the opposite side of the West FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere in the islands, as are Stanley credit cards, and the US dollar often is too.
On remote islands, credit cards might not be accepted, although British Pounds and US Dollars may be; check with the owners beforehand to find out the accepted payment methods.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so you should exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer there occurs when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, and it is common for temperatures to exceed 30 degrees Celsius in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel much colder than the thermometer suggests.
The amount of rainfall remains relatively constant throughout the year, with no distinct "rainy" or "dry" seasons.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife is ultimately wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
Regardless of how docile they may seem, bison, deer, moose, bears, and nearly all large animals may attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and pose a danger, so they should be given their space.
Additionally, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling foods and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is the city of Apia. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of slightly less than 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1379 AH.
The harbor was the site of infamous naval clashes in the year 1306 AH when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German people drowned.
During the struggle organized by the Mau Mau movement for independence, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the assassination of the paramount chief, Tupu Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland is located between two harbors, there are many beaches, the most popular of which are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and allow for safe swimming, and most of them are shaded by Butokowa trees.
Tāmaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitematā Harbour, in the Mission Bay and St Heliers suburbs of central Auckland.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded, with a nice selection of shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe.
The basic popular beer is known as "Number One," and it's not a complex drink, but rather a pleasant and refreshing beverage. Another local beer is called "Manta."
French wine varieties are numerous, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more widely distributed.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A small black coffee is an "espresso," while a cappuccino is topped with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent, although they are expensive.
Numerous trips to the coral reefs take place throughout the year, and coral reef damage rarely occurs due to any of these reasons.
However, seek advice from the authorities, comply with all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes be found at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away if they see one.
Saltwater crocodiles don't usually live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance assures the traveler that they will have a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their intended destination.
Although you might find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent, travel agents often have deals with specific hotels.
It is customary for travel agents to offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even bundled packages that include flights and hotels.
They can also hold the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
Despite that, any modifications or requests should be directed through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
Regarding some festivals, the vast majority of attendees at music festivals decide to camp on-site, considering it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to get there early to secure a campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages might be finished, there are sections of the festival that may continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals include dedicated camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea region in winter, you should check the location of your cabin, as passing through ice causes very loud noise for those most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises include spending time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually put in a lot of effort to increase the time and money that guests spend. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They have special meals, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and keep them in the building.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages, but intoxication hinders sound judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of a gambler staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snowfall, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you can't drive as if you were driving on smooth asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow may fall to stop you for a very short time.
Icy conditions such as falling ice, ice storms, condensation, or ice on car windows can cause limited visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are considered normal in many countries, and traffic usually continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist draw in Africa and the most prominent for many visitors.
The term "safari" is typically used to refer to overland travel to observe the stunning wildlife in Africa, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get very close to the cars, and standard equipment will allow for good viewing.
Lions, leopards, and tigers sometimes feel shy, and you can see them better using binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "walking tour", or "hike") consists of hiking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from the 16th of Muharram to the 28th of Muharram, 1443 AH, and some of the Games' events will be held at other locations in different parts of Japan.
After Tokyo hosted the Olympic Games in 1383 AH, it will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for the year 1441 AH before the postponement was announced, you may face a difficult situation.

Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Many hotels offer irons and ironing boards for borrowing, even if they aren't already in the room.
If there's no iron available, or if you don't prefer wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Don't let the fabric get too hot (which could lead to shrinkage or, in the worst case, burning).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in other areas, you need to boil it for several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness. If you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they are not familiar with in their native regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause annoyance, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infection.
Contagious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not usually described as pests.
Shopping in duty-free shops is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and duties in specific locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on expenses for products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, regularly passing through isolated forested terrain.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: there are always steep slopes, narrow passages, and sharp bends.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than they were in the preceding and subsequent sections—typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and strict adherence to them is more important than elsewhere.
Strangely, the cell phone service seems to be stronger here than in many other areas along the way, like the forests of Pennsylvania for example.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and diverse, resembling the pastries of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are popular, with apples baked in pastries year-round, while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often eaten specifically with a cup of strong coffee.

Indonesian cuisine is a collective term encompassing a wide array of regional cuisines found throughout Indonesia, due to the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from.
However, if it is used without additional terms, the term tends to mean that the food originates from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago islands, Javanese cuisine features a range of simply spiced dishes, with peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices being the prevalent flavors favored by the Javanese.
Stirrups are considered supports for the rider's feet, hanging down on both sides of the saddle.
It offers more stability for the rider, but can have safety concerns due to the potential for the rider's feet to get caught in them.
If a rider falls off a horse but their foot remains caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. There are a number of precautions that can be taken to reduce that risk.
Firstly, most equestrians wear riding boots with a heel and a very narrow, smooth sole.
Secondly, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the rider's stirrups to fall free from the saddle when pulled backward as the rider dismounts.
Valle Cochamó - the premier climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of walls and large granite boulders.

Snow sports on slopes, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow-covered patch of ground using skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is considered a major activity during travel and has a large number of enthusiasts, who are sometimes known as "ski bums," as they plan entire vacations centered around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The history of downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1278 AH, the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It's related to Alpine skiing tours or mountaineering, but it doesn't usually involve ski touring or mountain climbing, as those are practiced on very steep terrain and require stiffer skis and tall boots.
Think of cross-country skiing as similar to hiking.
In good conditions, you'll be able to cover somewhat longer distances than walking, but you'll rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on prepared trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries means you have to go through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
Despite that, the Schengen Area functions to some extent as a single country in this regard.
As long as you remain in this area, you can generally cross the borders without having to go through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for entry visas for each Schengen member country individually, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
Some tax agencies define antiques as goods over a hundred years old, but there is no universally accepted definition of what we consider to be antiques from manufactured items.
Age definitions have geographic variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than it is in Europe.
Handicraft products may be recognized as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced goods from the distant past.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of income for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many other professionals.
Even traditionally, and despite that, not all Sami people participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather they lived off fishing, hunting, and the like, and primarily used reindeer as draught animals.
Many Sami people today work in modern crafts. Tourism is also an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami region.
Despite the widespread use of the word "Gypsy," especially among non-Roma people, it is considered an offensive term due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to travel advice, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You might also want to seek advice from governments other than your own, but the advice from those governments is specifically for their citizens.
Speaking of one example, American citizens in the Middle East may face situations that differ from what Europeans or Arabs face.
Travel advisories are just a summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often quick, general, and simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it depending on the geography, topography, and weather conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, and hurricanes.
Severe regional and seasonal weather phenomena include: snow, ice, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to familiarize themselves with any risks of severe weather events occurring in the places they are visiting due to the impact this may have on their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that might be considered a war zone must obtain professional training.
Searching online for "hostile environment course" might lead to the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the problems discussed here in much greater detail, and usually through practical experience.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines that deal with survival in the wilderness, while publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travelers planning to undergo gender affirmation surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documentation for their return trip.
Governments vary in their willingness to issue passports that do not specify gender (X) or to issue updated documents to match a preferred name or gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies greatly.
Security checkpoint searches became much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era (after Ramadan 11, 1422 AH).
Transgender people should not expect to pass through scanners before surgery while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the return flow of waves that break on the shore, often near reefs or something similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the backflow concentrates in a few deep sections, and a strong current may form there towards the deep water.
Most fatalities result from exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you swim out of the current, swimming back will be just as easy as usual.
Try aiming for a spot where the current doesn't control you again, or, depending on your skills and whether someone noticed you, waiting for rescue might be another option.
Reverse culture shock happens faster than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more intense.
Sometimes, travelers who easily adapt to a new culture face particular difficulty in readjusting to their original culture.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home country's culture.
When I first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
People might not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The pyramidal sound and light show is one of the most enjoyable things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show starts.
You can usually always hear the sound of tourists and vendors here. The sound and light show is like a story in a book.
The Sphinx was placed as a backdrop and narrator for a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and the different pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1234 AH, are claimed by multiple countries and have a large number of bases, with 16 of them being active in 1441 AH.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island, which has the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among other places, Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the caldera, submerged by a still-active volcano, offers a stunning natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region located south of the Antarctic Peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth Mountains range, which extends for 360 km and is divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, including Vinson Massif, whose peak reaches 4,892 meters, also known as Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, with the absence of cellular phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to a satellite to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used via shipping, including pleasure boats, as well as exploration missions that have remote data and voice needs.
There must be a local telephone service provider capable of providing more information about how to connect to this service.
Traveling and learning are becoming a more popular option for those planning a gap year.
The program enjoys popularity, especially among those who have finished schooling, as it allows them to spend a year before joining university without jeopardizing their education.
Frequently, enrolling in a year-long training course abroad can improve your chances of getting into higher education in your home country upon your return.
There is usually a fee to register for those educational programs.
Finland is considered a wonderful destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also contains thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
You don't need a yacht in the archipelago and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are big enough for any yacht, small boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, where there is a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it's completely unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the number goes from one to forty).
Most premium Baltic cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historical city for a few full days while returning and sleep on board the ship at night.
If you are traveling on coastal exploration cruises, you will not need a separate visa (starting from the year 1430 AH).
Some tours feature the German city of Berlin in the brochures; however, as you can see from the map above, Berlin is not a place near the sea, and the tour price does not include a visit to the city.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they've never flown before or have experienced a traumatic incident.
It's something to be ashamed of: it's not much different from personal fears and other disliked things that many people possess.
Understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight might help some people overcome the fear that stems from the unknown or from a lack of control.
Good money is paid to shipping companies to deliver things quickly. Time is usually very important when it comes to business documents, goods, and spare parts for urgent repairs.
Larger companies own their own planes on some routes, but there was a problem for other routes and smaller companies.
If they send the items by air freight, it might take several days on some routes for unloading and customs clearance.
Sending the packages as checked baggage was the only way to receive them quickly, but airline internal regulations do not allow sending baggage without a passenger, so this is where you come in.
The obvious way to be able to travel first class or business class is to allocate a large sum of money to get this privilege (or better yet, have your company do it).
However, this comes at a significant cost: As a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the regular economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in looking for discounts on business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airline knows very well that there's a specific core group of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they are charged accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In the year 1414 AH, this conflict led to the creation of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (Transnistria), which declared itself independent in eastern Moldova and has its own government and currency, although it is not recognized by any member state of the United Nations.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center situated around a large gulf surrounded by mountains.
Wide streets, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are juxtaposed with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century souk, and old mosques and churches, even though the city has more of a Mediterranean European feel than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has a unique octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are exquisite marble statues of doves above some of the graves.
It's worth spending half an hour wandering around the interesting village.
The romantic city of Sintra, with its breathtaking beauty, is located to the north in an easily accessible location, and it's the city that gained fame among foreigners after Lord Byron's dazzling account of its masterpieces.
The "Scooterbus 403" regularly travels to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In addition, to the north, you can visit the Great Shrine of Sayyida Fatima (a holy shrine), which is a world-renowned site of Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially on a mass grave site, in addition to it being a place of almost infinite significance to a huge portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many other people who had loved ones killed or worked to death there, both Jewish and non-Jewish alike.
Please treat this website with all due dignity, respect, and reverence it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site by putting marks or offensive writing on the walls of the buildings.
The city of Barcelona has two official languages: Catalan and Spanish. About half the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
Despite this, most signs are expressed in Catalan because, according to the law, it is considered the primary official language.

Regular announcements in the metro are broadcast only in Catalan, while unexpected disruptions are announced via an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The people of Paris are known for their selfishness, rudeness, and arrogance.
The best way to navigate life in Paris is to behave with good manners, like a "bien élevé" person – someone well-mannered – even though this is often just an inaccurate stereotype.
The rough Parisian exterior will quickly evaporate if you show some basic courtesy.
The dense forests fill and shape Plitvice Lakes National Park, consisting mainly of beech, fir, and spruce trees, and are characterized by a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It possesses a large and diverse collection of plant communities, due to the range of local climates, different soil types, and varying elevation levels.
The region also harbors a highly diverse array of animal and bird breeds/species.

During visits to monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and to cover their shoulders as well.
Most monasteries provide a shawl for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow this from the storage at the entrance, but these clothes aren't washed after every user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, relies on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.

All nouns, in addition to the word "Sie" (formal "you") for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
It is an important method for distinguishing between some verbs and nouns.
It can also be said that it makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complex due to the need to know whether a verb or adjective is being used in the affirmative form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters we need to watch out for are 'c' and 'g', because their pronunciation changes based on the following vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce "raa" (ر) and "rraa" (رر) differently: "kaaru" means "dear," while "karroo" means "carriage."
The Persian language has relatively easy and often familiar grammar rules.
That's why reading this grammar introduction will help you learn more about Persian grammar rules and understand phrases better.
And definitely, your knowledge of a Romance language will make learning Portuguese easier for you.
However, people with a little knowledge of Spanish might quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough to Spanish that it doesn't warrant studying separately.
Outdated observatories are usually unusable today, remaining as museums or educational sites.
While light pollution wasn't a major problem for them like it is these days, they were usually located in cities or university campuses, making them easier to access than those built in the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities located in remote areas with suitable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms—known as Hanami—has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the most popular.
In Japan, the Emperor organized the first cherry blossom viewing parties exclusively for himself and other members of the nobility around the Imperial Court.
Plants thrive best in their natural environment, so resist the urge to pick them, even if it's "just one" specimen.
When visiting a formally landscaped garden, collecting "samples" will also get you kicked out, no questions asked.
Generally, Singapore is considered a very safe and easy place to get around, and where you can buy almost anything after arrival.
However, due to its location "close to the tropics," only a few degrees north of the Equator, you need to deal with both: persistent high heat and scorching sun (which is almost always the case when the sky is clear).
There are also a few buses heading north to the city of Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure the bus you're planning to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good idea for a vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, taking a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube River, or canoeing along the Erie Canal.

Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Christ.
Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians in various parts of the world also adopt many of the traditions surrounding holidays.
There's a tradition of staying awake throughout the entire Easter night in an open space to see the sunrise.
This tradition can certainly be interpreted from a Christian theological perspective, but there is a possibility that it was a religious rite for spring and fertility from pre-Christian times.
The more traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil service on Holy Saturday, with gatherings often beginning to celebrate the resurrection of Christ at midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands did so either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, numerous mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you decide to visit the Arctic or Antarctic region in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
That provides a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, as the sky will be dark for more or less the entire day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is mostly not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy stargazing.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
Suits are the traditional work attire, and colleagues address each other by their family names or by their job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is of utmost importance, as it emphasizes collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
