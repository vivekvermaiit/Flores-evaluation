According to one broad theory, this not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils typically cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal had reddish-brown plumage on the upper side of its wings and pale or carotenoid coloring on the underside.
This information also provides insight into the feathers of birds.
Because dinosaurs didn't have a fully developed shaft in their feathers, called a rachis, but did have other feather characteristics—barbs and barbules—researchers inferred from this that the rachis is a feature that evolved later developmentally than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researcher suggested that even if it's a juvenile dinosaur's tail, the sample shows an adult bird's feather and not a chick's down.
Researchers suggest that even though it may be a small dinosaur's tail, the specimen displays a large bird's feather and not just down feathers from a chick.
Yesterday morning in Gaziantep, Turkey, a car bomb explosion at the police headquarters killed two police officers and injured more than twenty others.

Light and rotation are both used to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but this program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The reason for the tidal disruption the team was simulating is the tidal forces between the Milky Way's dark matter and the galaxy's dark matter.
Just as the moon creates a pull on Earth, causing tides, similarly the Milky Way exerts a force on the Triangulum galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory explains that the darkest matter around the Milky Way is located around the galaxy in a halo-like structure and is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a technologically backward experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, placing a pre-printed sheet of paper referencing their desired candidate into an envelope.
After the voter's identity is verified by the authorities, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting roll.
France's electoral law, instead, strictly governs procedural codes.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes present in the boxes at the start of the election, and that no envelopes other than those duly counted and from authorized voters have been added.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under heavy supervision, following specific procedures.

In the women's seated group, four skiers failed to complete their runs, and in the giant slalom, 45 out of a total of 117 skiers failed to rank in the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police has recovered a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya said, "We have arrested five men who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampra Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chander Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later they were readmitted to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adikoya is still at Edinburgh Sheriff Court, which has charged him with the murder of his son.
She is in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, but any evidence presented by her as an eyewitness should be considered tainted because her image has been widely publicized.
This is common anywhere in the UK, but Scotland's justice system works differently, and the courts view the publication of photos as potential bias.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee writes, "If journalists publish photos of suspicious individuals, it must be assumed that they are putting their lives on a dangerous path."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for the prosecution, indicated to journalists that no further comment would be made until at least a legal claim has been made.
According to the leak, the document will mention the border dispute, which Palestine wanted based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
According to reports, other issues discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Following the signing of an agreement, Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years, while the PA only agrees to concede such a presence for five years.
In the supplementary pest control trial, the shooters were to be closely monitored by the rangers, as the trial was overseen and its impact was evaluated.
Eligible volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program in a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to NPWS Director Park Conservation and Heritage Executive Director Mick O'Flynn, the four shooters selected for the first targeting campaign were given comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of proposals for ways to take the country towards new elections.
The commission was a response to widespread protests against Martelly's rule that began in October.
Violent protests erupted due to repeated failures to hold elections after 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod malfunctions due to overheating have been reported, of which a total of six caught fire and four people suffered minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called "non-serious."
The ministry reacted to the postponement of Apple's report by calling it "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 am local time (09:19 am GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said there were no reports of any damage in the country.
Additionally, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that no tsunami signals were detected.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus of Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took them hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Numerous prisoners have been released, and so far, six deaths have been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were quickly released because they were Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced an elderly woman because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Ligins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and gynecologist and began working at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his spare time.
Her research found that if a hormone is administered, it will accelerate the development of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a two-moon night. Beautifully unique just like her. A powerful woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as weird to me... maybe more so...love and will miss...hope she is in a good place."
Before the 2010 federal election, among the 1,400 people who opposed Australia becoming a republic, there was an 8 percent increase in their number since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard, during the 2010 federal election campaign, claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of people in the poll hold this opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the survey, 29% of the people surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
An Olympic gold medalist who was a swimmer in the Commonwealth Games in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays, but his fitness has always been under suspicion due to his complaints.
He is unable to take medication to relieve his pain because he has been banned from sports.
Professor Curtis Cooper of Central Missouri discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people verified the research using various hardware and software until the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of delivering water to Earth, as well as organic materials, which can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo began his term as governor earlier this year and last month signed the bill legalizing gay marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political drivel and stupidity."
He is expected to be a contender for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to FAA claims, will allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, which, unlike older ground-based technology, helps air traffic controllers identify aircraft with greater certainty and provide pilots with more accurate information.
Increased transport is not in operation and Overground trains will not be stopping at Wembley, and car parking on the ground and park-and-ride facilities are not available.
The fear of travel limitations has increased the likelihood of the game being played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A science journal published on Thursday reported on the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, whereas it was believed that the process took much longer due to breeding between the native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be transformed into any shape. It can be rolled into a small size.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be bent and folded. It can also be hammered into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and fitted into other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can prepare an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes based on the chemical process or the alkaline (alkaline) level.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (since hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Combine the two dry powders and then, with clean, damp hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture from your hands will react with the outer layers, which will look funny and form a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to an impressive sewage system.
Traces of sewage systems have been found in the Minoan city of Crete and in the houses of Santorini, Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had bathrooms. During the Roman civilization, bathrooms were often part of public bathhouses where both men and women used them.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and immediately sends it back down.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision to some extent.
Sending a satellite or telescope into space requires a massive rocket, sometimes up to 100 feet tall.
This wheel has brought about amazing changes in the world. The biggest thing this wheel has done for us is provide us with extremely easy and fast transportation.
It has given us trains, cars, and many other modes of transportation.
Under them come other medium-sized cats that eat prey ranging from rabbits to blue bulls (Nilgai) and deer.
Ultimately, there are many small cats (including domestic free-ranging cats) that eat a lot of small prey such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is the concept of keeping something hidden, a special job each cat holds that prevents it from competing with others.
Among cats, lions are the most social, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three related adult males, along with more than thirty females and cubs.
Women are generally closer to each other, as if they were a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion's pride functions like packs of wolves and dogs, animals akin to lions in vigor (not other big cats), and packs of animals that are highly deadly to their prey.
A well-built athlete, Tiger can climb trees (though not perfectly), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is related to the group (genus Panthera) of lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four cats that can roar.
A lion's roar isn't like the full, loud roar of a tiger; rather, it sounds more like a sequence of grunting, squeaking sounds.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are smaller than it.
According to scientists, ocelots track animals and use their sense of smell, inhaling scents, to locate them for hunting (eating), wherever they have gone.
They can see well in the dark due to night vision, and can also move silently. Ocelots blend into their prey's territory and hunt them with a swipe of their paw.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were used to.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations compared to the former in order to become a strong competitor.
There has been absolutely no change in the indigenous population; they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they gradually start to look less similar to other populations.
Eventually, even after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they couldn't be called the same race.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (meaning breathing in and breathing out).
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is in the form of plants. Animals cannot survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws held over 70 extremely sharp teeth, embedded with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, which meant nothing that passed through it could survive.
Although we don't know for sure, it may have had a serrated tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may have also been a cannibal.
It attacked everything that came into the water, even the huge dinosaurs like T-Rex were no match for it.
Although we might be familiar with most of their food, the people of Rome also included strange or unusual things in feasts, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of mouse called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich people preferred to feast together where sofas were arranged for them to sit on.
Ancient Roman food could not include foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The people of Babylon built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People would bring animals and other things to sacrifice to the local deities, and priests would try to fulfill the needs of the deities through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, known as ziggurats, were built as part of a temple.
The tower's top section was a special shrine for the deity.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, housing wasn't that important.
The Hebrews spent most of their lives under the open sky.
The women cooked food in the courtyard; the store was just open counters visible from the street. Stone was used for the construction of the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, therefore wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red, having been banished from Iceland for manslaughter, found a green and fertile area in the remote south, which he named Greenland.
Even if we don't focus on this research, we still know that Eskimo communities were already living there at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences in the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence was "Original Declaration of Independence Dated 4th July 1776." This text was written upside down, towards the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows whose writing it is, one thing is certain: early in its life, this large, leather-bound document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that sign language was included as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated the northern region of France, but the southern region was still not free.
This was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were the French who made a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940, and instead of fighting their invaders, they collaborated with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces attacked southern France, an assault known as "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and then turned their attention towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture that is shared by a large group of people, a society, who live and work together cooperatively.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civitas," which means citizen, related to the Latin "civilis," meaning civic and citizenship, which means city or city-state, and it defines the size of any type of society.
City-states are at the forefront of nationhood. A cultural civilization signifies knowledge across many generations, a long-standing heritage, and positive dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind any proper historical evidence, and they fail to be recognized as complete civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states united to form a weak central government - under the Articles of Confederation - whose main focus was the Congress.
The Congress was too weak to impose any kind of taxes, and, because of the absence of any national executive body or judiciary, it had to depend on the authorities of the states, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
He also did not have the power to override tax laws and rates between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states treated the central government with such levity that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, where Italian people participate in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), which make Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Because Japan consists of a group/cluster of islands, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago" in terms of its geographical location.
Taiwan's beginnings date back much earlier to the 15th century when European sailors passed by, recording the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating changes in indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces asserted control over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing dynasty.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding its authority over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the complex's periphery have been reconstructed to show tourists what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and this restoration continues today.
For example, the most widely used format in still photography is 35mm, which was the dominant reel size at the end of the analog reel era.
It is still made today, but even more importantly, its aspect ratio is maintained by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
Therefore, the ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to or approximately near this aspect ratio.
The third is a very abusive and often ridiculed simple instruction that creates dynamism while considering the order of measurement in an image.
This shows that the most important place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which was an established and powerful church, was investigated.
For almost a thousand years, Christianity united the European states despite their differences in language and customs.
Its universal power affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the core Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's financial funds are specifically for that cause.
The church's central authority has been based in Rome for almost a thousand years, and this centralization of power and money has led many people to question whether it is right in principle.
As soon as the war broke out, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
Cutting off crucial military and public supplies proved to be an effective strategy, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which has been codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain planted explosives to prevent any ship from entering any part of the sea, which endangered even neutral ships.
Because this strategy had limited success, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most people and nations was one of peace and isolation.
After witnessing the horrific events and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such circumstances again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla emigrated to America to take a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job).
In ancient China, there was a unique way to denote different time periods; each stage of China, or each family in power, was a specific dynasty.
Besides this, each dynasty had an unstable timeframe for its divided provinces. Among these, the most famous period is the Era of the Three Kingdoms, which occurred for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, a terrible war occurred between several families vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying as they fought for the highest throne in the magnificent palace of Xi'an.
Many social and political influences such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from monarchism to republicanism, the shift towards nationalism, and the recognition that a country belongs to all its people rather than a single ruler.
After the revolution, professions opened up to male applicants, from which the most enthusiastic and successful people emerged.
The same applies to the army, because the army's ranking was now starting to be based on merit rather than class-based.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a deep interest in subjects beyond this worldly life. He often went to a cave for contemplation, known as "Hira," located on a mountain called "Noor" (light).
He made this himself, which remained so for a long time, giving a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located atop a mountain peak in the northern mountains of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, even knowing about its existence, it's not at all easy to find. Once inside the cave, it's completely isolated.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and several mountains nearby. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
Of the seven wonders, only the Great Pyramid at Giza remains standing in good condition today.
The Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures built by the Egyptians in the third century BC in honor of deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," located within Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The signal to raise the gaz (a unit of measurement) is like a V, and the signal to "lower the gaz" is like a staple or a square without an underline.
"Up" means you should push the gauge starting from the tip, and "down" means you should pull the gauge by placing the handle side (where you hold the gauge) against the wire.
An up-bow typically produces a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to let the pencil roam within your own markings, but remember that the printed bowing marks are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
The terrifying King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
In a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the King and Queen, they returned to Paris.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to fully open the windows of their carriage.
Once, a member of the crowd shook the head of a Royal Guard who was then killed in Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The war expenses incurred by United States imperialism in its quest to dominate the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They forced the American colonial regime to pay taxes to cover the costs and interest on bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Indeed, the vast amount of profit generated from the long-standing exploitation of the Filipino people would form the basis of the core profits of United States imperialism.
To understand a Templar, one must understand the context behind the issuing of an order.
The era in which these events transpired is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The Early Middle Ages came before the High Middle Ages, and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from those based on existing technology or efforts for essential techniques, to a clear understanding that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their application in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that technological development follows a path far beyond the influence of culture or politics itself, and that technology, in turn, "impacts" societies in ways that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that motor cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, building a road network across the entire country for only a limited number of cars is not economically feasible, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce car prices.
Due to increased car purchases, the number of accidents on roads also increases, leading to the invention of new techniques in the healthcare sector to treat damaged bodies.
In Romanticism, cultural determinism, derived from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel, played a significant role.
In the context of romance, geography transformed individuals, and the customs and culture that arose from that geography, over time, and by adapting to the societal level, were better than arbitrarily enforced laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was famous as the epicenter of luxury from 400 AD to approximately 1100 AD.
Its position was largely rejected during the 12th century because the Crusaders returned gifts like silk and spices because they were more valuable than the offers made by Byzantine markets.
At this time, the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was at its peak between the 10th-11th century and in the 14th century.
In the beginning, this attire was largely influenced by Byzantine civilization in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, the style in the West could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. The biggest development as a result of the Crusades was that people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is that farming which is done to produce food in just the right amount to meet the needs of a farmer and his family alone.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, generally organic system that boosts production by using saved seeds found in a specific area, along with crop rotation or other related simple techniques.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
A subculture brings together people with similar ideologies who feel ignored by mainstream social norms and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ based on the age, caste, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinctly define a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a specific and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, etiquette, and secret language.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to present some cases of unfortunate children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not allowed to interact socially by adults during their formative years.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children are kept captive by people (often by their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the child is also due to the parents' refusal to accept a severe intellectual or physical disability of the child.
Wild children may have endured extreme exploitation or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Other people are blamed for raising the animals; some people say they have lived independently in the forests.
Raised completely by non-human animals, a feral child will likely behave (within physical limitations) entirely like the animals that raised them, such as exhibiting fear or aggression towards humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding isn't a method of learning, but rather a support that provides assistance to those going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
A platform can be virtual or real; in other words, a teacher is a form of platform, but so is the highly annoying paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are incorporated into the software, and their purpose is to question, prompt, and explain processes that students find difficult to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even forced eviction.
No child should be raised in an environment that isn't nurturing, caring, and educational, but it happens to too many children.
We consider the foster care system a safe space for these children.
Our foster care system provides safe homes, loving environments, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
They are expected to have all the needs met from foster care that weren't in their previous home.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The various features of the internet promote further expansions in terms of usage, and accessibility for enjoyment.
For example, "training" and "socialization" have been suggested as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Ighami and McCord (1998) identified "individual contribution" and "ongoing relationships" as newly motivating aspects when they investigated audience responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions and facial movements that last for only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that by interpreting subtle micro-expressions, one can detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks demonstrated in his paper "The President's Speech" how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain injury are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He also suggests that such abilities, which are helpful in explaining human behavior, may also be exhibited by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research shows that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of observed variation.
Segregation and recombination completely randomize the allelic variation between two pools each generation.
In the open savanna, it is difficult for a hominin with a human digestive system to meet their amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth (failure to develop), malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant-based protein sources are found in the leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, non-vegetarian food (insects, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but it also provides a high amount of protein, which includes all essential amino acids.
Considering all things, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep fragmentation is an intentional process of waking you up during your usual sleep time and letting you fall back asleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock's settings in your sleep, it might be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include consuming large amounts of liquids (especially water or tea, which are known to be diuretics) before bed, forcing the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner strength a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in their body and soul.
The less stress there is, the more positively vibrant life will be. Every individual has the capacity to find complete peace and contentment.
Every person can acquire knowledge. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was largely influenced by the Mahayana path of compassion and various techniques of Indian Yoga.
The philosophy of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love for God.
Kundalini energy is awakened through Kundalini Yoga with yoga asanas, breathwork, mantras, and inner meditation.
Deity Yoga is the central practice of Tibetan meditation. Through visualizing different divine figures, energy pathways are cleared, chakras are activated, and wisdom consciousness is created.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, which led to unity between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. After the war ended, this unity could not last long due to differences in the systems, processes, and cultures between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allied nations were now enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years, and it was actually meant to be fought by proxy armies from Africa to the war zones of Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat across the Romanian border to an outpost to reorganize.
However, these plans became almost immediately obsolete after over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian Fronts after invading Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is still the best way to move large quantities of people and products across the ocean.
The job of a navy is traditionally to ensure that your country interferes with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods, while also maintaining your own ability to move your people and goods.
One of its most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. Americans were trying to move people and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At that very same time, the German navy, mainly using U-boats, was trying to stop the traffic.
If the Allied nations had failed, then perhaps Germany would have conquered Britain because it had the rest of Europe on its side.
Goats appear to have been domesticated for the first time in the Zagros Mountains of Iran approximately 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes started raising animals because they had easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Indigenous goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, and they were often tended by shepherds widely known as Gadriye. These animal husbandry practices are still in use today.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although horse-drawn carriages only have parallel wooden planks, these help the horses pull more weight at higher speeds and on rough roads.
Cross ties were introduced quite early to secure the tracks in place. Gradually, it was realized that tracks would be more efficient if there was a strip of iron on top.
It became a common practice, but the iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the cart.
Eventually, the wooden wheel was replaced by the iron wheel. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The earliest known mode of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning upright man) two million years ago.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
The ability to walk on two legs is found in Australopithecus skeletons from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can start living in greater harmony with the environment, we can join an environmental conservation movement, and to some extent, we can even become active activists to mitigate future problems.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we need to get to the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is plainly evident that the world has changed considerably due to the scientific and technological advancements of humankind, and the problems have become even greater due to the increasing population and humanity's unrestrained lifestyle.
The draft, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop after being approved by Congress on July 4th.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the documents was done by John Nixon in July in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had his army listen to it read aloud in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
25 Dunlop broadsides still exist, which are the oldest copies of the document. No copy of the original writing survives.
Today many archaeologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many things about birds here that look like dinosaurs.
Their feet have a layer of skin or hide and toes, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used to date are based on manipulating information that has been coded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits – or bits – when using computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are quite common, so an immediate diagnosis may not be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning could be the presence of open containers of medicine or household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid box instructions for that particular poison.
The word bug is used by biologists in a technical sense for this group of insects.
This terminology comes from ancient bed-bugs, which are insects highly adapted to feeding on humans.
Parasites and commensals alike are sad to be adapted to living in the nests or homes of their hosts.
Across the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a prominent neurological disease affecting young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their or the child's best interest.
This couple might choose to plan for the adoption of their child.
In the adoption process, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can acquire the rights as parents of the child.
The main goal of science is to figure out how the world works scientifically. This method actually guides most scientific discoveries.
Although it is singular, an experiment, is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses by questioning and through observations, and to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical writings and, in particular, the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West cut itself off from these Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Some have observed that rhythms in psychology and behavior depend primarily on the presence of internal oscillators and their generation via biological clocks.
Intrinsic rhythms, which do not require external cues, have been documented for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillations that maintain the duration of these cycles even in the absence of an external element.
One of the key suggestions from the Hershey and Chase experiment was that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments: one to label the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus and another to label the phage's proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ-line cells or not.
Only changes in germ-line cells can be passed on to offspring, whereas changes elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in natural scenery, including plant and wildlife.
Examples of activities to be carried out on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to travel, take photos, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns or cities to go to their workplaces, passing by those whose workplaces are in the place they just came from.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is connected to each other, unlike a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now reveals that this vast carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from a stable state that has aided human development for the past 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do such complaints arise in the transportation system, why do they fail daily? Are the transportation engineers completely incompetent? Or is there some other fundamental problem?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations, and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because one cannot predict a driver's behavior with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave with reasonable consistency within limits; thus, there is some reasonable uniformity in the traffic stream and it can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships are established in three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relations help in planning, designing, and implementing road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape predators, obtain food, and mate.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings against the back of their body.
It provides them with a longer range of small spaces to hide from predators.
In today's time, the insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus stated that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people thought the opposite; that the solar system, including the sun (and other stars as well), revolves around the Earth.
This seems right, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, is that how it is?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It contains 8 times more water than the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, it is up to six miles wide.
20 percent of the water that flows from land into the oceans via rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It is fed by the water of thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction in stone continued until the end of the ancient empires, nothing ever surpassed the scale and technical sophistication of the pyramids of Giza.
The New Kingdom of ancient Egypt marveled at its older monuments, which were already thousands of years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legal and official communications.
Italian, which is used by the majority of people among them, is also an everyday language used in the state for work, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they are readily found in their pure form in nature and are easier to mine from the earth with basic tools compared to others.
Aristotle, a philosopher, explained that everything is made up of a mixture of one or four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was mostly like the four states of matter (in equal order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to create the products we see.
An alloy is fundamentally a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the list of chemical elements contains many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You may also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them could fit inside the full stop at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a great friend to many people when it was made.
Unfortunately, with the development of new writing methods, the pencil has come to be regarded as having less status and use.
People now write messages on computer screens, never going near a sharpener.
One can only wonder what keyboards will be like when something new comes along.
An atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to hold multiple protons and neutrons together in a central point.
The cart is wheeled up a hill. It then expands again by spreading the nucleus, releasing some energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they can disintegrate without any disturbance or with a slight disturbance.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and soil. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It is thin under Maria and dense under the highlands.
Because the layer was thin, there may have been more vents nearby. It was easy for lava to reach the surface.
Content theories focus on what attracts people's attention or what they like.
These principles state that people have certain fundamental needs and/or desires that are fulfilled because they are more prevalent in youth.
These theories look at what it is about specific people that makes them want to do the things they do, and what things in their environment will allow them to do certain things or not allow them to do certain things.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory are two famous content theories.
Generally speaking, two behaviors emerge as managers to lead their former peers.
It is a very difficult task for this type of manager to make tough decisions, take disciplinary action, conduct performance evaluations, delegate responsibilities, and hold people accountable for their actions.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into such an unfamiliar individual who feels that they must change everything that the team has been doing, or they must do it themselves.
Ultimately, the leader is most responsible for the team's success or failure.
This kind of behavior often leads to discord between the team leader and the rest of the members.
Agile teams are held to similar standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as points of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than formal team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which their local management might not understand.
The existence of a shared reality is a defining characteristic of a real team, something achieved by an "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
An invisible team is a management team to which every member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for every member.
Why would any organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing an educational institution? The sole purpose of putting the concept of institutional education into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively within the functional departments of an organization, creativity and proficiency are manifested.
As a result, a new innovative process for meeting customer needs may emerge from the organization's collaborative work process to deal with an obstacle.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must foster a culture of invention along with shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations reach higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating intuitive cognition. Therefore, it summarizes the research field and makes it more precise.
The interplay between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
There has been long-standing awareness that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect human behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technology allows for the observation and examination of brain structures and processes in ways that were previously impossible.
This provides us with more information and materials to build such simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves creating machines that can automatically perform tasks that require intelligence.
Examples include controlling writing, voice, and facial recognition, as well as the ability to perform customer checks and answer questions, planning, and scheduling.
Such things have become a separate discipline, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being built into many home computers and video game software applications.
Virtual field trips are a great part of any classroom. Often a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus trip isn't an option.
Technology offers this solution with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a field trip virtually is a wonderful way to convey and discuss the experiences encountered during the trip with future classes.
For example, every year the students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state's capital; the website is redesigned every year, but the older versions are kept online to be used as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with random grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Because students are often the most critical audience, blog writers start striving to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "encourages students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to satisfy people's interest motivates students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs enables students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet materials, students can describe their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002) as well as express their opinions in relation to the writings of others.
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and it is home to many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
In the far southern region is Niagara Falls, and the northern area of Muskoka and beyond is home to complete natural beauty.
These things and more highlight Ontario, the very things that Canada is known for by outsiders.
Vast areas far from the north are sparsely populated, and some areas are almost desolate wilderness.
For a startling population comparison: more African Americans live in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wild animals, Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in itself.
Most small islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known for their luxury beach resorts.
Arabs brought Islam to their country, and it had a major impact in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route for travel from Europe to India.
The area is bordered to the north by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female passenger, regardless of her actual marital status, state that she is married.
Wearing a ring can also be helpful (not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that due to cultural differences, they may be bothered by many things, and being followed and grabbed by the arm, etc., is not considered normal.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, this is not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BCE by Berber fishermen, and was used as a diplomatic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Baida, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of knick-knacks, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located very close to Rwanda in the east.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is largely safe, any excursions outside of Goma should be thoroughly vetted in order to understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province.
This city is a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo volcano, as well as some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
In Goma, you can get around by using boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis). A typical (local) fare for a short trip is ~500 Congolese Francs.
Due to its inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" began to be used as a metaphor for strange and remote places.
Today, Timbuktu is a very poor city, although its fame makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
Due to the desert sand, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites in 1990.
This was one of the major challenges Henry Louis Gates faced during the PBS special Wonders of the African World.
This city is quite different from the rest of the country's cities, as it has more of an Arabian flair than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park spans an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees.
Purchasing a Wild Card can also be beneficial for an individual, providing access to select parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong, and it is the very place that many tourists see as the main attraction.
The parade of buildings that create the Hong Kong skyline is coupled with a dazzling bar chart, made lucid by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best view of Hong Kong, come out of the island and go towards the Kowloon harbor.
A large portion of Hong Kong Island's urban development is denser along the northern shore, on reclaimed land.
This is the place upon which the British colonists seized control, and therefore if you are seeking evidence of the colonial history of this area, this is an excellent place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The jungle area within the Indian territory is called Sundarban National Park.
Forests are not just a swamp of tropical trees — they also include some of the remaining powerful forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which approximately one-third is surrounded by water/swampy areas.
The Sundarbans became a wildlife sanctuary in 1966, and it is estimated to now contain 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses run all day from the inter-district bus station (across the river), although mostly those heading east, especially those from Jakar/Bumthang, run between 06:30 and 07:30.
As inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to get to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't open to traffic until March 2017.
This bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts are also expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group who lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced agriculture for sustenance, and are now settled in eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of native tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was born from the clash of Spanish conquistadors with native indigenous groups, in what was formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies".
The colonization of the inhabitants of Spain lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has maintained much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is considered one of the countries with the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Canitas polo ground.
Small tournaments and matches can be seen here in the remaining days of the year as well.
To find out about tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP) at a value of one.
Currency exchange can be done at the island's only bank, located in Stanley beyond the FIC West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere in the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards likely won't be accepted on the outer islands, though British and US currency might be; check with the owner beforehand to find out what form of payment they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and this situation is always reversed.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, it is common to have temperatures exceeding 30°C.
Winters can be deadly cold: it's rare for temperatures to drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity can make it feel even colder than the thermometer reading.
Here, there isn't a distinct "rainy season" and "autumn": the rainfall rate remains almost the same throughout the year.
Even though many creatures in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild; they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
It doesn't matter how docile they seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost every large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of spectators are injured by not maintaining a safe distance. These creatures are wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, be aware that scent attracts bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or preparing fragrant foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the Upolu Island and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was established in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port became a center of an unpopular naval blockade in 1889 when seven warships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
Except for one British cruiser, all the other ships sank. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence led by the Maoist movement, Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed as a result of a peaceful gathering in the town.
Auckland has many beaches due to having two harbors. The most popular are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (North Harbour District) are located on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, many shaded by pōhutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitematā Harbour in central Auckland, between the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers.
These are often crowded family beaches, where you'll find lots of shops on the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is "Manta".
They have many French wines to drink there, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better for transport.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is readily available.
For Australians, the concept of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. Black is short 'espresso', cappuccino is overflowing with cream (without spilling), and tea is served without milk.
This hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but they are excellent.
Throughout the year, many reef trips are taken, and incidents of injuries on the reef from any of these causes are very rare.
Still, seek advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and heed safety warnings.
Box jellyfish come near the coasts and estuaries from October to April in 1770 North. Besides this time, they can often be found at other times as well.
Sharks still exist, although they sometimes attack humans. The vast majority of sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the tidal estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives travelers the peace of mind knowing that they will have a place to sleep upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although you can book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as camping grounds.
Typically, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, airport pickup/drop-off arrangements, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain further documentation for your destination (such as a visa).
However, any amendment or request should be processed through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the large number of attendees arriving at musical fairs consider staying on-site, and most attendees consider it a very large part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive early at a campsite near the music.
Remember that even if the main stages finish their music, the festival may still continue playing music late into the night in some areas.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location because the snow creates extremely frightening noises for those who are most exposed.
A cruise to St. Petersburg includes time to stop in the city. Cruise passengers are also granted an exemption from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos make many efforts specifically to ensure guests spend as much time there as possible and spend as much money as possible. Windows and clocks are absent there, and finding the exits can be very difficult.
To keep relatives in good spirits and to keep them entertained at home, they typically have special food, drinks, and entertainment options.
Some places offer on-site alcohol consumption. However, drunk people spoil the atmosphere, and all good gamblers understand the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at a high altitude or through mountainous terrain should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or extremely cold temperatures.
On icy roads, there is less friction and you can't drive the vehicle like you would on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, so much snow can fall in a very short time that it can trap you.
Snow falling, blowing, freezing, or being present on vehicle windows can also make it difficult to see ahead.
On the other hand, snowy and blizzard conditions are common in many countries, and transportation runs smoothly all year round.
Perhaps safaris are the biggest draw for tourism in Africa and a major attraction for many tourists.
In common usage, the word safari means a land journey, especially in the savanna, to view the amazing African wildlife.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and the scene will be viewed well with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes hesitate to come out in the open, and you'll see them best with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") involves a journey of a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will begin on August 24th and run until September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at various locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice, having previously hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may face difficulties.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-related cancellation policies were not extended to the end of March until 2020, when the Olympics schedule was set.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with premium tickets costing ¥7,000.
Damp clothes can be ironed to dry them faster. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to borrow, even if one isn't already in the room.
If a press (iron) isn't available, or if you can't wear pressed socks, you can use a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful that the iron isn't too hot (as this can shrink the fabric, or even burn it if it's too hot).
There are many different ways to purify water, and some methods are more effective for particular types of impurities.
In some places boiling water for a minute is enough, in others a few minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they have never seen in their home regions.
Insects can contaminate food, causing irritation, or in some severe circumstances, allergies, poisoning, or the spread of infections.
Contagious diseases, in themselves or as dangerous entities that can violently injure or kill people, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping can be a good option for purchasing goods that are exempt from tax and excise duties in some places.
In countries with heavy taxes, tourists can often save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The extended Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway between Point Marion and Fairmont presents consistently challenging driving conditions, passing through isolated backwoods areas.
If you are not used to driving on the country's roads, be aware of: steep grades, narrow streets, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than those on previous and upcoming sections — typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and it's even more important to strictly adhere to them now compared to normal conditions.
Although it's quite unusual, mobile phone service is stronger here compared to many other parts of the route, for example, compared to the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good, and like its southern neighbor Austria, they are extremely rich and diverse in Bavaria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apple pastries made year-round, and cherry and plum pastries available in the summer.
Many German baked goods include almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes are often eaten with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Kari is a dish based on herbs and spices, which includes meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be "dry" or "wet".

Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, has a seasonal recipe series; key Javanese ingredients are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various fragrant spices.
Stirrups support the rider's feet and hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer the rider excellent stability but there may be safety concerns about them due to the possibility of a rider's foot getting caught.
If a rider falls from a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, if the horse runs, it will drag them. To reduce this risk, several safety precautions can be used.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots, which have a heel and a flat, narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that will release a stirrup leather if a rider falls and is dragged by the saddle, preventing them from being caught.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing area, known as the Yosemite of South America with its steep big wall climbs and crags.
The peaks offer breathtaking views from the summit. Mountaineers from all parts of the world are constantly discovering new routes amidst the immense strength of its walls.
Downhill snowsports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow-covered peak with snowboards attached to your feet.
For avid enthusiasts planning to ski at a particular location throughout their vacation, often called "ski bums," skiing is primarily a means of transportation.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to around 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia in 1861 by Norwegians.
Packing for skiing: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
This is related to alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, but it generally doesn't involve that; instead, it is done in sloping terrain and requires more robust skis and boots.
Think of the ski run as a paved hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat more distance than walking - but very rarely will you achieve the speed of cross-country skiing on good tracks without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a continent that, although small in size, includes many independent countries. Normally, traveling to multiple countries means going through multiple visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen Zone, even so, functions largely like a single country in this regard.
As long as you live in this zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you won't have to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen member country, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for which manufactured goods are considered antiques. Some tax agencies define items over 100 years old as antiques.
There are geographical variations in the definition, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be seen as examples of ancient art, although they are less old than mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami community, and the culture surrounding this occupation is also important for many other businesses.
Although traditionally, not all Sami people are involved in reindeer husbandry, but make their living from fishing, hunting, and other such activities, as reindeer are mostly considered heavy burden-pulling animals.
Today, many people work in semi-modern businesses. Tourism in the Semi region is a significant source of income.
Although widely used, particularly in non-Romani contexts, the term "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its negative connotations and the misrepresentation of Romani people.
If the countries you want to visit are under a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also wish to seek advice from governments besides yourself, but their advice is tailored to their own citizens.
As an example, American residents in Central Asia may face different conditions than those in Europe or the Arab world.
The advice is only a summary of a country's political situation.
The ideas presented are often cursory, simplistic, and oversimplified compared to the detailed information available elsewhere.
The term "severe weather" is generally used for any dangerous weather event that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and it has many forms, which depend on geography, topography, and environmental conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rain, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, such as storms, tornadoes, downpours, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather includes blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be cautious of any weather-related hazards affecting their area, as they may impact their travel plans.

Pre-operative transgender people should not be expected to go through scanners compromising their privacy and untouched dignity.
A rip current is a flow of water returning from the shore, breaking through the waves, and is often seen at reefs or similar locations.
Due to the science in the underwater environment, return flow is concentrated on some deeper sections and can create strong currents in the deep water there.
Most deaths are due to exhaustion from swimming against the current; it's impossible to swim against the current.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming again isn't much harder than normal.
Based on your skills, or other professions, try to focus on the fact that you haven't been caught again or noticed; you want to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock happens faster than culture shock (it is less present during the honeymoon phase), which lasts longer and can be more intense.
Travelers who easily adapt to new cultures often face considerable difficulties readjusting to their original culture upon returning.
After living abroad, returning home, you've become immersed in a new culture and shed some habits from your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, they knew that travelers need time to adjust to a new country.
People might not realize that patience and understanding are also necessary for tourists returning home.
The Sound and Light show at the pyramid is one of the most fun things to do with kids in this area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in a silent state before the show begins.
Usually, you always hear the voices of tourists and vendors here. The sound and light show is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is set as a backdrop and narrator to a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and, in 2020, had the highest number of active bases, with sixteen.
This archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest of these is King George Island, where Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Among others, Livingston Island and Deception Island are included, where the caldera formed by an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region located in the south of the Antarctic Peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peaks of the peninsula meet here in the plateau, after which they re-emerge to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range contains Antarctica's highest mountains, the Nilsen Massif, reaching an elevation of 4892 meters at Mount Vinson.
In rural areas, where there is no cell phone network, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to go outside to an open space for a direct line of sight to the satellite in order to make phone calls.
The service, including pleasure craft, is commonly used by shipping for remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
For people planning a gap year, a more popular option is to travel and learn.
It is especially popular with school leavers, offering them the opportunity to take a year out to work before going to university, without any disruption to their education.
In most cases, enrolling in a gap year program abroad actually improves your chances of getting into higher education in your own country.
Generally, these educational programs will require tuition fees to enroll.
Finland is a fantastic place for boating. "The Land of a Thousand Lakes" contains thousands of islands within its lakes and archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a boat in the archipelago and lakes.
Although these coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are suitably sized for any type of yacht, smaller boats or kayaks offer a unique experience in them.
Boating in Finland is a national pastime, with seven or eight people aboard each boat.
It resembles Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is somewhat unique (for example, the image is one to forty in the Netherlands).
Most Baltic cruises offer extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can tour this historic city for a full two days and return to the cruise ship at night to sleep there.
If you only go ashore using shipboard tourism, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures present Berlin, Germany, as a destination; however, as you can see from the map, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and getting to the city is not included in the cruise price.
For people of all ages and backgrounds, traveling on a plane can be a frightening experience, especially when they have never flown before or experienced a fearful event.
There's nothing to be ashamed of in this: it's no different from fears or personal dislikes towards other things that many people experience.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight helps them overcome their fear.
Courier companies are well-paid to deliver items quickly. Usually, time is very important for business documents, commercial goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, big companies have their own planes, but it's a problem for other routes and smaller companies.
If they sent the goods by cargo plane, it would take several days to unload the cargo and clear customs on some routes.
The only way to get it there quickly was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations wouldn't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, where you're coming.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is to spend a large sum of money on this particular luxury (or, even better, to have your company pay for it).
However, it doesn't come cheap: as a crude rule of thumb, you can expect to pay four times the standard economy fare for business, and eleven times for first class!
In simple terms, there's no point in looking for discounts on business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there's a core group of frequent flyers who are willing to spend big bucks for the convenience of getting anywhere quickly and comfortably, and companies charge them accordingly, keeping this in mind.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova. The local language here is Romanian, but Russian is used by a majority.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has struggled with ethnic conflict.

Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established.
The major religion of Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir, with a population of approximately 3.7 million, is Turkey's third largest city, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Symrna, it is now a modern, developed, and commercial hub nestled within a vast bay and mountains.
Wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, modern shopping centers with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century style market, and an old mosque and church; despite all this, the city's atmosphere feels more like Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.

Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structure.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half the people prefer to speak Catalan, a much larger proportion understands it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are given in Catalan because it is established by law as the primary official language.
Still, Spanish is also used extensively in public transportation and other facilities.
On the metro, regular announcements are only made in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese, through an automated system.
Parisians have a reputation for being arrogant, rude, and proud.

The uncivilized exteriors of Paris will soon disappear if you show some basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is surrounded by very dense forests, mainly beech, spruce and fir trees, and a lush mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to its variable microclimates, diverse soil types, and changing altitudes, this area is home to an exceptionally high diversity of plant communities.
This area has a great variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and Caucasian squirrel, along with many other common species, can be found here.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts to cover their knees and shoulders.
Most Christian monasteries provide clothing to women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own clothes, especially those with bright colors, you'll be greeted with a smile on the faces of the monks or nuns at the entrance.
Along the same lines, men should wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the stock lying at the entrance, because these clothes are not washed after being used by everyone, so you may feel uncomfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men.
In other regions like the Mediterranean with its Maghreb cuisine, food is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used in these.
Pa amb Oli is a popular and simple meal, especially eaten at night during the summer: bread and olive oil, tomato, and any available spices or accompaniments such as cheese, tuna, etc.
For you, all nouns, including the word "ਸੀ" (si), always begin with a capital letter, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.

Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain as museums, or educational sites.
In the early days, light pollution wasn't the problem it is today; it was generally confined to cities and campuses, and they were more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are very large facilities located in remote, isolated locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, also known as Hanami, has been a part of Japanese civilization since the 8th century.
This concept came from China, where the plum blossom was a flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by rulers only for themselves and the upper class people around the royal court.
Plants look beautiful when in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even a single specimen.
Even visiting a formally arranged garden to collect "specimens" is enough to get you excommunicated without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to visit and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But due to being posted in a "high tropical zone", which is only a short distance north of the equator, you will have to be prepared to deal with both heat (always) and intense sun (when the sky is clear, which is rare).
Very few buses go north to Hebron, which is traditionally the burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.

There is a tradition of getting up on Easter night to see the rising sun at certain designated places.
While there are certainly Christian spiritual interpretations for this tradition, it may very well be of pre-Christian origin and a fertility rite.
In more traditional churches, the Easter Vigil is usually celebrated on the Saturday night of Easter weekend, during which those attending the service often begin celebrating the joy of Jesus Christ's resurrection as soon as midnight strikes.
Originally, animals arriving on islands either swam, flew, or drifted there.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to travel, and this journey resulted in predominantly reptile-based fauna in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammalian animals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you travel to an Arctic or Antarctic region in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, as the sky will be mostly clear throughout the time.
As the regions are very sparsely populated and have low pollution, problems rarely arise, and you can even enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal, which can be quite different from the way Westerners work.
Suits are formal business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
